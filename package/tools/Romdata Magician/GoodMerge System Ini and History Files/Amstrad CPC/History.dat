Licence To Kill (c) 1989 Quixel / Domark Software, 
Inc. 
 
A "James Bond" action/arcade game based on the 
movie with the same name. Your aim is to avenge 
the death of Felix Leiter, who was killed by the 
drug baron Sanchez. 
 
Technically the game consists of several different 
vertical scrolling action sequences. In each stage 
you must fly, drive or walk through a preset 
terrain. While doing that, you have to shoot 
enemies, avoid their shots and collect items 
(mainly ammunition). Some levels rely more on 
shooting, while others test your reflexes.

Leader Board authors Bruce and Roger Carver tried 
their hand at tenpin bowling, in one of the game's 
earliest recreations. The process of bowling the 
ball involves timing a succession of clicks to set 
the right angle, speed and curve, similarly to 
Leaderboard's system. Three skill levels are 
provided - Kids level sets the speed and hook 
automatically, while Amateur has more margin for 
error with hook/slice than professional. The game 
is played from a plan view, with four other 
(empty) lanes visible. Single matches or a league 
structure can be played.

Updates to the gameplay include an energy bar, 
which can be run down by either being hit from 
incoming fire or using a special weapon. The 
energy bar can be replenished by picking up 
power-ups, while special weapons (lightning, 
cyclones and waves) can knock down all fighters on 
the screen at the time.

1st Division Manager is a football management game 
where you take on a team of your choice in any of 
the top four English leagues. On the main menu 
there are four icons as well as some major 
information such as your name, the name of your

be able to make a phone call to either the 
Transfer Market (for buying and selling players) 
or the the Bank (to get a loan). The third icon is 
a note book and by clicking on it you will see 
tables from all four divisions. The last icon is 
the picture of a football pitch and by pressing it

20000 Lieues Sous Les Mers (c) 1988 Coktel Vision 
/ Coktel Vision 
 
The game is based on an idea by Jules Verne. 
 
In 5th July 1867 the government has decided on the 
departure of the famous ship the "Abraham 
Lincoln", which will leave on the trail of the sea 
monster. The great French professor Mr. Arronax 
will also take part in the expedition. 
The weeks passed without any sign of the monster's 
presence in the area, when, one day, 300 miles 
from the shores of Queen Charlotte's Island... 
three members of the expedition will set on board 
the Nautilus, submarine navigated by Captain Nemo. 
The player takes the Anorax' role to find out 
more. 
 
The most part of the game is spent on the Nautilus 
which consists of three rooms: the living room, 
the control room and the library. There the player 
can manipulate objects and talk to people to 
receive hints what to do next and the state of the 
Nautilus. With the map he influences the route. 
Sometimes the player leaves the submarine to 
explore other locations respectively solves 
puzzles to receive more hints or to solve action 
sequences, e.g. fighting against a shark. 
 
The game is played in real-time which means the 
key to success is being at the right location in 
the right time. This also results in various 
possibilities to render the game unwinnable and 
regular waiting times. The player also needs to 
watch Nemo's mood, if he angers Nemo, e.g. by 
manipulating the ship instruments, he locks the 
player into his room and valuable time passes. The 
game is played completely in point & click and has 
no function to save progress.

2 Player Soccer Squad (c) 1991 
 
Most football management games written for 64K/48K 
computers concentrated their memory space on 
providing as many features as possible for a lone 
player. As the title implies, this game is an 
exception - 2 players each take control of a club, 
taking it in turns to make their managerial 
decisions and play their matches. For an extra 
competitive edge, they can include their own name 
among the players (which are otherwise made up of 
the real players of the day). 
 
The game uses a fictional 20-team superleague, 
with English and Scottish clubs, as well as a 
knock-out cup. You can buy or sell players, who 
have ability ratings out of 15, and swap your 
squad of 19 around to choose 11 starters plus 2 
substitutes. Match scores are listed along with 
goalscorers, although the scorers update more 
quickly than the scores. You are kept up to date 
with financial changes after each match.

Pinball Power (c) 1989 Mastertronic Ltd. / 
Mastertronic Ltd. 
 
A standard pinball table is featured in this 
simulation, but with the original addition of a 
tilted view of the table, giving an illusion of 
3D. As with any table, the aim is to get a high 
score, and this is done by hitting particular 
targets repeatedly. There are bonus ramps, 
bumpers, lights to be hit to increase your bonus 
count (which can be toggled using the left and 
right flipper keys). There is no 'pin' between the 
flippers, and no apparent tilt feature, meaning 
that luck plays a bigger part than in most pinball 
games. The ball is always launched at a standard 
speed on each of your five lives.

3D Starstrike (c) 1985 Realtime Games Software 
Ltd. / Realtime Games Software Ltd. 
 
The Outsiders have attacked the Earth Federation, 
laying waste to its defense fleets. In 
desperation, Federation Command sends the new 
Starstrike space fighters to attack the 
Outsiders's main bases (which are converted 
moons), hoping to exploit a fatal flaw in the 
design: a direct hit to the reactor at the center 
of the base might lead to its destruction. 
 
Both regarding graphics and gameplay, 3D 
Starstrike is essentially a clone of Atari's Star 
Wars. Using wireframe graphics with a first-person 
perspective, the player controls the Starstrike 
fighter in several distinct phases: the first 
phase is the approach to the enemy base, where 
Outsider space fighters must be destroyed. The 
second phase takes place close to the surface of 
the base, where enemy bunkers and laser towers 
await. The third phase is a trench run, where gun 
turrets await at the side of the trench, and 
catwalks blocking the way must be dogded. The run 
culminates in the reactor room, where two reactor 
pods must be hit to destroy the base. 
 
After a base is destroyed, the game continues with 
a new base in the next level, with later levels 
having a higher difficulty.

As well as recreating off road racing, this game 
has considerable capability to upgrade your 
vehicle. There are four choices of vehicle on 
offer, each of which has its own 
weight/top-speed/build strength and so on, and 
thus is suited to different circuits. You can also 
buy upgrades and repairs, including carrying some 
spares. 
 
There are four completely different types of 
course, each taking place on a different surface - 
Mud, Ice, Desert and Mountains. Each of these is 
littered with hazards, which can either be 
painstakingly avoided, or driven through (with the 
resultant risk of damage).

The action in this motorcycle racing game takes 
place in a small box of the screen, but there’s a 
good reason for this – unlike virtually every 
other 8-bit motorcycle racing game, the screen 
tilts as you lean the bike into the corner, giving 
it a much more realistic feel. Six British 
racetracks are featured, with 3-lap races. You 
must finish in the top 3 of the 8-bike field to 
qualify for the next one. You will often need to 
pit for fuel and tires during the race. The other 
bikes get quite a head start on you by being able 
to accelerate more quickly, but the first few are 
usually quite easy to pass on the first lap.

You've parked your car near the entrance of 
airport terminal. The day looks good. Your flight 
is in a few hours, so you have time to get ready 
to take-off... 
 
In the game you are a regular pilot of "A 320" 
airbus, who will be involved suddenly in terrorist 
action organized by air pirates. The plot is 
divided in three parts: two point-and-click 
adventure phases set in airport and on terrorist's 
island and simplified flight simulator phase 
between them. 
 
During the real-time adventure phase in airport, 
you should move between locations, interact with 
people and objects to gain information on radio 
channels, frequency, number of route, time of 
take-off, which vary in each seance of gameplay. 
 
After sitting in cockpit the game is turned in the 
flight sim. You should perform take-off, activate 
the radio, and receive a first radio transmission 
from pirates, who will inform you on actions you 
should perform or airbus will be blown up. Finally 
they direct your airbus with passengers to the 
pirate's island, where you should land it. 
 
During the real-time adventure phase on the island 
you should find the pirate's house, get inside it, 
and defeat pirate's mastermind with a gun. 
 
The overall gameplay is flown in first-person 
view, when player should move the cursor on the 
screen to move to certain location, collect, use 
or interact with items as well as talk with 
persons. The persons are real actors originally, 
but digitized slightly as well as overall 
environment. The game is flown in real-time and 
special part of screen shows the current position 
(parallel in time to yours) of some terrorist, who 
you can't see until reaching a certain point of 
the game. 
 
The game is played by one person and originally 
made in French.

What's that coming over the hill, is it a monster? 
Yes, as this Rampage-influenced arcade game sees 
you play either an ogre or a dragon. Both are 
searching an island for an egg which will give 
them super powers. 
 
This is located inside a building, and to find the 
right one you must continuously smash them up, 
using either the ogre's horn or the dragon's tail. 
Humans must also be attacked as you see them, as 
their catapults weaken you. Food can be found to

Once you have located the egg, a one-on-one beat

Abracadabra (c) 1988 Odisea Software / Proein S.L. 
 
A knight called Clus d'Eledorf falls in love with 
princess Violeta. The jealous witch Saligia, 
herself in love with Clus, puts a curse on the 
lovers: the knight has to remain haunting the 
castle Burgenfels as a ghost, while the princess 
is forever lost in the woods. 
 
Abracadabra is a Spanish text-adventure made with 
P.A.W. (Professional Adventure Writer), a popular 
Spectrum program. The parser is similar to the 
Infocom one: it supports most of the standard 
features of it at the time (chain commands, 
pronouns, adverbs, prepositions and adjectives, 
for example). The game is divided in two sections, 
with the second one loaded after the first is 
completed: 
In the first one, Clus has to break the curse and 
escape his prison. While in spectral form, the 
knight is destroyed if he leaves the castle. He 
can, however, roam freely through its halls to 
collect its objects and speak with its 
inhabitants. Burgenfels is a labyrinth with secret 
doors. 
 
In the second load, a reincarnated Clus has to 
find princess Violeta, his lost love,  in the 
Greenwald forest.

All-Weather-All-Terain (AWAT) combat aircraft. 
Each is housed in one of our three remaining air 
bases. 
 
You must fly sorties from our bases, and attack 
and destroy the numerically superior enemy air and 
ground forces. Only then can you attempt to 
destroy their nearly invincible navy. Good Luck! 
The future of the free world hangs in the 
balance...

Action Fighter (c) 1989 SEGA Enterprises Ltd. / 
Firebird Software Ltd. 
 
This is a top down vertically scrolling shooter, 
in which you start off as a motorbike. You are 
quite vulnerable to attack at first, but power ups 
come in the form of a Sega van which you have to 
dock with. The first time you dock you get double 
fire, the second time gives you a rocket, the 
third gives a rear force field and the fourth 
invulnerablility. 
 
By destroying cars and bikes that appear on your 
way, you can collect A-F letters. Collecting A 
through to D allows you change into a sportscar 
which is less vulnerable to attack, but not as 
nimble. Collect all the letters in order to be 
able to transform into a high tech plane. This is 
the final stage of one of the five missions. Only 
the high tech plane can guide you to your 
destination in which your main target is hiding. 
 
There is also time limit in which you have to 
complete the mission. It is advisable to transform 
into the high tech plane as fast as it is 
possible. 
 
Picking up flags gives you bonus points with 
10,000 points gaining you an extra life.

to the other versions of the game this one is more 
puzzle-oriented, meaning the player has to find

Another big difference is that this version is not

Advanced Destroyer Simulation (c) 1990 Futura / 
Futura 
 
Advanced Destroyer Simulator (ADS) is a naval 
combat simulation set in World War 2. It was the 
first naval simulation to use real-time filled 3D 
graphics. Its style and mechanics are reminiscent 
of Epyx's Destroyer (1986). 
 
ADS simulates the H.M.S. Onslaught, a British 
destroyer of the O-class fitted with three cannon 
turrets, four torpedo tubes on port and starboard 
respectively, and a sonar to detect and track 
submarines. In ADS, the Onslaught is not part of a 
flotilla. 
 
There's no campaign, gameplay is mission-based and 
set in three scenarios (two in the CPC version) 
with five mission each: The Mediterranean around 
Sicily, the English Channel between UK and France, 
and the North Sea coast of Norway. Objectives 
include seek-and-destroy assignments, patrols, 
convoy escorts, submarine hunts and blockade runs. 
Each scenario also offers an open “Delta” option 
where you cruise and hunt without specific 
objectives. 
 
You navigate the destroyer manually, in real-time 
and from a first person perspective, though with 
the help of a scenario map. ADS simulates ship 
combat as a close-quarter exchange of torpedoes 
and cannon fire. In proximity to enemy land bases, 
Stuka fighters can attack and must be shot down 
with the cannons. Submarines are tracked with the 
sonar and can only be attacked once they surface. 
Enemy vessels include freighters, tankers, torpedo 
boats, destroyers and cruisers. Most missions are 
time critical

wizardry, with the targets to be lit including the 
word 'MAGIC' as well as a weather potion and a 
magic cottage. Trapdoors must be shot open to get 
their bonuses, then shot shut again to prevent the 
ball being lost in them. Extra balls are offered

Basildon Bond (c) 1986 Probe Software Ltd. / Probe 
Software Ltd. 
 
The player controls Basildon Bond, whose task is 
to collect a series of codes within five hours, 
under orders from 'P', who had his codename 
changed to 'B' to confuse the KGB. To unlock these 
codes, Basildon must piece together several jokes, 
which are found in various rooms inside a 
television studio. Once Basildon has collected a 
joke, they must be entered in the main computer. 
 
Collecting the jokes is not an easy task for 
Basildon. For one thing, to use certain objects, 
some other object must be collected first. For 
another, moving TV cameras roam around in some 
rooms, and if Basildon comes into contact with any 
of these, he returns to the computer room and ten 
minutes of his time is lost. 
 
However, to deal with the cameras, Basildon is 
equipped with ten Cooperblasters which can be used 
to summon Cooperman. Once Cooperman has been 
summoned, the player is free to navigate him 
toward the camera, and once Cooperman comes into 
contact with the camera, it is destroyed. If the 
player leaves and re-enters the room, the cameras 
return and the player has to summon Cooperman 
again, wasting precious Cooperblaster ammo. 
Cooperman can only be summoned ten times, and the 
player is unable to collect more ammo, so they 
need to use Cooperman wisely. 
 
One summon out of ten introduces the player to 
another character known as Blunderwoman, who does 
far more damage than Cooperman because whereas 
Cooperman just flies from one side of the screen 
to the other in a straight line unless the player 
interferes, Blunderwoman flies diagonally across 
the screen and back again without the player's 
involvement, killing any cameras that she does not 
kill the first time. 
 
The game ends when the five hours are over.

shoot automatically all the time. 
 
The game is viewed from behind the plane with you

heart it offers the usual shooter mechanics,

original, the game is split into distinct sections 
- as with the original these are each loaded one 
at a time. 
 
The first section is a horizontally-scrolling 
shoot 'em up, where Agent X flies freely and must 
collect powerful weapons to be able to get 
through. This is followed by some platform action, 
which involves climbing a tower collecting code 
pieces along the way. The final section is a 
Breakout clone, pre-dating Arkanoid as the first

In this action/simulation game by Microprose the 
player takes the role of an U.S. Army airborne 
ranger. These Airborne rangers are dropped behind 
enemy lines by parachute to perform all kinds of 
dangerous missions. Gameplay consists of 3 phases: 
Reading the mission briefing and outfitting 3 
supply pods with machine gun ammo, time bombs, 
first-aid kits, grenades & LAW rockets depending 
on this briefing. 
2. Flying over the mission map in a V-22 Osprey 
   plane to drop your 3 supply pods and 
   parachuting out of the plane yourself. 
3. Performing the actual missions and reaching 
   the pick-up point before time runs out. There 
   are 12 different missions which include 
   capturing an enemy officer, blowing up an 
   ammunition depot, photographing an experimental 
   aircraft and liberating P.O.W.'s 
 
Missions take place in either an arctic, desert or 
temperate setting. Using the mission map the 
player must decide the route towards the mission 
objective. This might require them to crawl 
through trenches, run around minefields or take 
out enemy soldiers and bunkers. Airborne Ranger 
was one of the first games with some missions that 
required a stealthy approach (staying undetected 
until a certain time, taking out a guard and 
stealing an enemy uniform etc.). 
 
Airborne Ranger can be played in practice or 
veteran mode. In practice mode, gameplay is 
limited to a single mission, while in veteran 
mode, a series of missions or an entire campaign 
is played in order to earn medals & promotions. 
All missions can be played on several difficulty 
levels.

"In space no-one can hear you scream." 
That tagline from the movie is apt for this 
strategy adaptation that follows the plotline of 
the first movie in the franchise. The action 
starts after the chestburster scene which 
unleashes an alien organism into their enclosed 
spaceship.  The remaining crew members must 
attempt to destroy it while the traitorous android 
tries to protect the alien. 
 
There are 3 decks to search with 35 different 
rooms which are connected by ducts which the alien 
can use to sneak up on people.  You can herd the 
alien into an airlock to blast it out into space, 
or set the auto-destruct on the ship and flee in 
the shuttle with all remaining live crew members 
plus Jones the cat who must be found and put in a 
box. 
 
The screen shows you a plan of the deck you are 
on, and the ducts in the immediate area.  There 
are ‘trackers’ and sensors which can be used to 
pinpoint movement in other areas.  In ordering 
each crew member, you are given possible movements 
or other actions such as picking up weapons, 
entering the ducts or catching the cat. In certain 
situations, special options will appear such as 
starting the self-destruct system when in the 
command centre. The responses to orders are also 
affected by the personality of the crew member, 
and how much they have had to suffer. 
 
The screen also displays reports on the condition 
of the crew member you’ve selected, whether there 
is any damage to the room you’re in and whether 
the duct grills are open (meaning the Alien has 
been through there). You also get the occasional 
message from the ship's computer ‘Mother’ like 
when a crew member dies.  Sound effects create 
suspense. At times you hear the alien move around 
or doors and grills being opened as well as the 
blip from the tracker.

Aliens (c) 1987 Software Studios / Electric Dreams 
Software 
 
Electric Dreams' game based on the 1986 film 
Aliens is a first-person strategy game somewhat 
similar to Space Hulk. The player controls six 
characters from a remote terminal, guiding them 
through a 255-room complex in search of the Alien 
Queen. Each character has a helmet camera and a 
smart gun, each controlled by the player acting in 
the role of overall operational commander. 
 
The player can switch to any character at any 
time, and must consider coordinating their 
movements and finding a safe location before 
switching to the next character. Characters occupy 
one room at a time, and can pan their view a full 
360-degrees inside each room. Doors can be locked 
to halt Alien progress, or blasted open to get 
through (at the cost of permanently destroying the 
door). Alien bio-mass must also be destroyed 
before it spawns facehuggers, and the Aliens 
themselves leave lethal puddles of acid when 
killed (and so shouldn't be killed in front of 
doors!) 
 
Aliens prowl the complex and are attracted to 
gunfire. They will home in on nearby characters 
and attack, requiring the player to aim that 
character's gun to defend against the rushing 
Alien (a headshot kills instantly, while three to 
the body do the same).  If an Alien attacks a 
character the player is not controlling, they will 
"capture" that character (indicated by a yellow 
status light).  The player must guide another 
character to the position of the hostage and kill 
the guarding Alien to rescue them.  If not, the 
captured character will be lost. 
 
Ammunition for all characters is limited, and 
refilled only by making a trip to the complex's 
armory. Similarly, a medical bay can replenish any 
damage. Characters also have limited stamina, used 
up with every move made. When stamina is low, the 
player must find a safe spot for that character to 
rest up. The complex also houses a generator 
controlling the lights, which the Aliens can 
destroy, or the Marines can then repair.

Alien Storm (c) 1991 SEGA Enterprises Ltd. / U.S. 
Gold Ltd. 
 
The aliens are invading Earth, and it's up to the 
"Alien Busters" to wipe them out and destroy their 
creator. The Busters consist of Karla, Gordon, and 
Scooter. Each one of them have their own weapons 
and special attacks. 
 
When you start the game, you can select any one of 
these characters to play as. There are six 
missions to complete (eight in the Genesis 
version) with several stages, and each mission has 
you blasting aliens all the way to the end, from 
the streets to the mother ship where you'll meet 
the mother of all aliens. Unfortunately, blasting 
these aliens will not be an easy task, as they get 
tougher in every mission, and are capable of 
hiding into objects such as plants, postboxes, 
trashcans, drums, and several others. Each mission 
has an objective such as rescuing people 
destroying an UFO. 
 
When you deal with a few aliens, flying heads will 
appear, which you can shoot to collect life or 
energy (by the way, life is important to you, 
since if yours get empty, you're dead). However, 
rather than using your ordinary weapons, you can 
use the special attacks that are enough to kill 
aliens you currently see. These types of attack 
vary depending on the character you choose at the 
start of the game. For instance, Gordon summons a 
U.S. Air Force Jet that drop bombs across the 
street, while Scooter is able to teleport out of 
his present location, and leave a series of bombs 
that will blow up aliens on sight, he will then 
re-appear. However, using your character's special 
attack uses up a lot of energy, and if you have 
little or no energy, you can't use it. 
 
At the end of some missions is an alien boss, 
which you must destroy in order to complete the 
mission. Also, at the end of every one, you have 
to enter buildings where you participate in a 
shooting gallery. The object is to kill aliens 
popping up from several locations with the 
building. 
 
You can play Alien Storm by yourself, or with 
another person.

Released at a budget price around the peak of the

competition. Each player selects two wrestlers 
from those on offer, and when the one in the ring 
is weakened he can go to the edge of the ring and 
tag his team-mate, who then enters the ring and 
allows the other to recover. 
 
You can either play individual matches (for one or 
two players) or a full tournament, with three 
rounds of variable length. There is no 
joystick-waggling in the control system, with a 
variety of kicks, throws and punches on offer 
using simple joystick motions. Once the players 
are close together they grapple - this gives you a 
chance to lift and then piledrive your opponent.

Ancient Art of War is a real-time strategy game 
based on the very basic elements of war: unit 
types, formation, and strength. The game is set in 
ancient battle-style times before the use of gun 
powder, consisting of the three basic unit types 
of that period: the light armored but fast 
"Barbarians", the heavily armored but slow 
"Knights", and the ranged "Archers". A fourth 
non-combatant unit type is also available: 
"Spies", which is only available under certain 
campaign rule settings. 
 
The game consists of different scenarios to choose 
from, each with a different geographical setting, 
difficulty setting, visibility setting, and 
victory condition setting. Some settings may be 
subject to change by the player. 
 
Gameplay is represented in two major areas: 
 
1. The first is the tactical/political map, 
   which visualizes geographical and terrain 
   elements from a top-down perspective. Here the 
   player can coordinate, position, reinforce 
   troops, and also command them to attack, defend 
   or ambush enemy troops in a real-time setting. 
   Time may be set to pause, faster or slower to 
   make battle plans easier

Annals of Rome (c) 1986 Personal Software Services 
/ Personal Software Services 
 
Annals of Rome begins in 273BC and sets you as a 
Roman senator, with the ultimate aim of colonizing 
as much of the known world as possible, and 
retaining that power against Carthaginians, 
Vandals,  Parthians, Persians and all the other 
world forces. You have a strong army at your 
disposal, and can direct your generals as to which 
countries they attempt to invade. 
 
The game is turn-based, and these turns operate in 
phases, beginning with the economic circumstances 
of population and tax income being decided - it's 
recommended to keep taxation taxing low unless 
things become desperate. The game then updates you 
on the statuses of your generals, and give you the 
chance to redistribute them to other parts of your 
kingdom. 
 
Officers may rebel and cause a civil war - 
fortunately this can usually be pre-empted. More

You are police officer Bob, whose aim is to 
apprehend a certain quota of criminals 
(litterbugs, speeders and the like) each day. This 
is done by chasing them and sounding your siren at 
them - in some cases they will need ramming off 
the road.  There are also hardened criminals to 
catch - if you can get one of these to confess, 
your day's work is considered done. 
 
The game's action is presented with an overhead 
view of your squad car. Car upgrades are 
available, to be brought from your reward money. 
You earn Demerits by crashing, wrongly arresting 
innocents, or failing to meet your quota. Too many 
demerits and it is game over.

This simple action game is based on the Hollywood 
movie "Arachnophobia", produced by Steven 
Spielberg. 
 
South-american spiders have overrun a large area 
in some areas of the United States. It's your task 
to clean the infested farms, houses or public 
buildings by using an very effective pesticide 
called "Toxi-Max". One of the most useful devices 
your character can use is an arachno-detector 
indicating approaching vermin. 
The player spite is controlled from a side-view 
and basically only needs to use his toxic 
pesticide in time to defend himself from attacking 
spiders, just like a simple reaction game.

Events in the rural village of Ambridge have 
enthralled BBC Radio 4 listeners since 1950. The 
computer game re-creation casts you as one of the 
scriptwriters. The game is split into four parts, 
in which you control Jack Woolley, Elizabeth 
Archer, Eddie Grundy and Nelson Gabriel in turn. 
Guide each character through their decisions (from 
3 multiple-choices), with the aim of choosing the 
most listener-friendly choices. Your choices 
affect the show's rating directly, as well as 
changing the forthcoming plot much more than in 
The Secret Diary of Adrian Mole. 
 
Characters can be removed from the show depending 
on how you develop certain storylines, but make 
sure not to axe the popular ones. Avoid offending 
special-interest groups, as the BBC comes down 
hard on writers who generate complaints. 
 
In some versions you can play the four parts 
individually

Electronic Arts, Inc. 
 
The sequel to the classic Archon, Archon II: Adept 
features a more complex board and enhanced 
gameplay. 
 
Each side plays as an Adept - a powerful wizard 
with the ability to cast spells against other 
Adepts and his summonings - and must defeat the 
other side, either Chaos or Order, by attacking 
him/her with summoned Elementals or Demons. Each 
side can summon 4 unique elementals at a time or 
choose from 4 demons, common to both. 
 
Gameplay is similar to the original, reminiscent 
of a chess-like board game, requiring strategy, 
but with arcade elements, especially when two 
adepts confront each other face-to-face. The board 
also shifts from time to time, making the strategy 
less predictable.

Archon - Light & Dark (c) 1985 Free Fall 
Associates / Electronic Arts, Inc. 
 
Archon: The Light and the Dark is a strategic 
board game with some similarities to chess. Two 
sides, a light one and a dark one, consisting of 
18 pieces each compete on a board divided into (9 
by 9) squares. You win the game by having one of 
your units on each of the five powerpoint squares 
or by removing all opposing pieces from the board. 
 
However, you can't just remove a piece from the 
board by landing on it. When two pieces clash, the 
outcome is decided in the battle arena during 
one-on-one real-time combat (just like in Star 
Control, also by Paul Reiche III). If the 
real-time combat takes place on a dark square, the 
dark monster gets a health bonus (longer life 
bar). On a light square the light side gains an 
advantage. There are also some squares whose color 
changes over time (from afternoon, to dusk, to 
night, to dawn etc.), which adds an extra layer of 
strategy to the game. 
 
Unlike chess the two sides are not identical. Both 
sides consist of mythological creatures. For 
example the light side has among others unicorns, 
valkyries and a djinni while the dark side 
features basilisks, banshees and manticores. The 
differences are not just cosmetic. Two special 
pieces are the light wizard & the dark sorceress, 
they can both cast magical spells like: imprison a 
unit on the board, shift the flow of time (change 
day/night cycle to your advantage), bring one unit 
back from the dead etc. 
 
The different pieces have their own movement 
restrictions regarding the number of squares 
they're allowed to travel on the board and whether 
or not they can jump over other units (like the 
knight in chess). Units also behave different in 
combat

$<a href="http://www.mobygames.com/game/cpc/arkanoid"</a>

Arkanoid (c) 1987 Taito Corporation / Imagine 
Software 
 
The original Breakout concept involves controlling 
a bat at the bottom of the screen and using it to 
catch and direct a ball so as to hit all the 
bricks which are arranged at the top of the 
screen. It was unpopular for over a decade, before 
Taito revived it with some new ideas in this 
arcade game. 
 
The game's plot redefines the bat as a Vaus 
spaceship, the ball as an energy bolt, and the 
bricks form a mysterious wall stopping the ship 
from progressing to safety. 
 
By the mid-80s, power-ups were popular in most 
types of arcade games, and Arkanoid features them. 
They are caught by positioning the bat below them 
as they fall (meaning that you risk missing the 
ball if you go for them at the wrong time). The 
power-ups include lasers (which are mounted to 
each side of the ship and allow you to shoot out 
the blocks), a catching device (so as to be able 
to fire the ball off at a different angle every 
time you hit it) and one that slows the ball.... 
sorry, bolt.... down. Needless to say, the game 
inspired tonnes of clones, few of which added 
anything else.

Goscinny and Uderzo’s cartoon characters are from

the Roman invasion. They can do this due to 
Getafix the druid’s magic potion, however the 
cauldron used to make this has been smashed into 
several pieces. Can brave Asterix and overweight 
Obelix find the pieces? 
 
In this arcade adventure, it all comes down to 
you. The fifty screens you must explore take in 
your home village, a Roman encampment, and the 
forests in between. You have five pieces of wild 
boar, and these are used as you become hungry. 
 
Contact with wild boars or Roman soldiers triggers 
a one-on-one fight with punches and kicks. 
Defeating a boar earns you another piece of food, 
to restore energy once all lives are gone. Some 
sections are blocked until you collect their keys. 
 
In the US version the character Asterix was 
replaced by a barbarian and the game's title was 
changed to Ardok the Barbarian.

there are replacement vials of this to be found. 
He is armed with a garlic-firing gun, plus limited 
numbers of garlic pills, which make enemies avoid 
him. 
 
The first five levels feature the objects required 
to kill the She Vampires — a crucifix, large 
garlic piece, stake, mirror and mallet. Once they 
are killed, he must make his escape, facing all

ATV Simulator (c) 1987 Codemasters Software 
Company Limited, The / Codemasters Software 
Company Limited, The 
 
Viewed side on, and with a split screen 2-player 
option, this game simulated the then-new All 
Terrain Vehicles in an action-based way. The game 
features a succession of courses, which must be 
navigated in 30 seconds. You must run to the 
vehicle initially, and will also have to manually 
remount if you fall off - all costing you more 
precious time. Careful use of the wheelies and 
jumps is crucial to completion. Each hazard must 
be taken at the right speed, which you'll learn 
through experience.

Auf Wiedersehen Monty (c) 1987 Gremlin Graphics 
Software Ltd. / Gremlin Graphics Software Ltd. 
 
In Monty On the Run the intrepid coal thief Monty 
Mole fled to the rocky island of Gibraltar. 
However, the Intermole agency is on to him, and 
his only hope of escape is to trek across Europe, 
collecting enough cash to buy the Greek island of 
Montoss and live there in luxury. 
 
This is Monty's third game, and the structure is 
similar to the previous two. It's platform and 
ladders based, with 80 screens each representing 
some area of Europe - the Eiffel Tower and the 
Leaning Tower of Pisa are among the identifiable 
landmarks. 
 
There are different ways of travelling through the 
levels - some bouncy platforms coupled with a new 
super-leap move allow for big progress to be made, 
while Monty can also suspend from the ceilings and 
dodge his way across. Monty can now fall without 
being hurt, although landing on water can cause 
multiple lives to be lost in quick succession. 
 
There are many items to collect  - the most 
important are Eurocheques for money and airplane 
tickets. Once on a plane you must fight off the 
encroaching Intermole planes for extra points.

levels while avoiding the bad-tempered animals and 
machines on the way? 
 
Baby Jo in: "Going Home" is a side-scrolling 
platform game. Jo can pick up rattles which can be 
tossed at enemies (such as bees, lawnmowers or 
spiders). Apart from watching out for the baby's 
dropping health (represented as an increasingly 
tearful face), the baby's diaper gets wetter over 
time and the thirst increases, too. If the diaper 
becomes too wet or the baby becomes too thirsty, 
the player immediately loses a life, so collecting 
fresh bottles and diapers is important. 
 
The game is multilingual (you can chose between

You control an astronaut who is wearing his 
spacesuit and jetpack. The object of this game is 
to get out of a maze inside a planet. The maze is 
comprised of different rooms, and, more often than 
not, each room has a monster that you need to 
avoid. When you come in contact with a monster, or 
use your jetpack, your fuel level decreases. When 
the fuel gauge is empty, you will lose one of your 
lives. 
 
Along the way, you will pass containers that store 
various chemicals, and you will be able to carry 
only one chemical at once, but you can switch the 
chemicals around. Some of the chemicals can be 
mixed together to create other chemicals and

through time to stop their arch-rival Biff from 
changing the future. The game consists of five 
parts, each inspired by one of the movie's most

   newspapers, but with isometric levels and lots 
   of enemies to dodge. 
2. Jennifer Rescue: Guide Marty's girlfriend 
   Jennifer out of the house without her meeting 
   one of the four family members. Open and close 
   doors to make the persons go from one room to 
   the next in this top-down puzzle sequence. 
3. Beat Biff: A side-scrolling beat-em-up 
   sequence in the tradition of Double Dragon. 
   Fight your way through a grim 1985 by jumping, 
   hitting and kicking at Biff's lackeys. 
4. Band Puzzle: Rearrange the mixed-up parts of 
   an animated picture of the school band in this 
   sliding block puzzle. The clock is ticking. 
5. Hoverboard Chase 2: Another hoverboard

Back to the Future III is a collection of four

traveled back through time to the year 1885 - and 
they're soon deep in trouble when they face "Mad 
Dog" Tannen's gang and have to find a way to 
return to the present. This game takes four scenes 
from the Hollywood movie Back to the Future III 
and turns them into arcade sequences: 
 
1. Buckboard Chase: Doc Brown goes horseback in 
   an attempt to save Hill Valley's lovely school 
   teacher Clara. This game of quick ducking, 
   jumping and shooting alternates between a 
   side-scrolling and a top-down perspective. 
 
2. Shooting Gallery: The name says it all. A 
   classic game of aim-and-shoot, spiced up by 
   hidden extras and bonus targets. 
 
3. Pie Throwing: Meet the Mad Dog gang. They 
   have guns, and you have... cream pies. It's an 
   isometric version of the shooting gallery, only 
   with ammo. And the targets shoot back. 
 
4. The Train: Basically a side-scrolling 
   beat-em-up on train wagons with some ducking 
   and jumping. Get rid of the mechanics and 
   collect speed logs to push the engine to a 
   magic 88 mph.

In the year 3037, the most competitive sport in 
the known universe is Ballblazer. For the first 
time ever, humans from the planet Earth have won 
the right to compete in the final round of the 
Ballblazer Championship, to fight for Earth's 
honor and the title Masterblazer! 
 
Ballblazer is a 3D futuristic soccer-like game, 
where the player (inside a Rotofoil) is set on a 
one-on-one 1,155 square playing field (the Grid). 
The objective of the player to kick a floating 
ball (Plasmorb) inside the opponent's goal 
(Goalbeams). A player may compete against a human 
or computer opponent. 
 
The Rotofoil is equipped with a multi-purpose 
forcefield. This forcefield when in short distance 
of the Plasmorb will act as a pull field, 
automatically pulling the Plasmorb towards to 
player. When a player in possession of the 
Plasmorb shoots, the forcefield will act as push 
field and launches the ball. When the match 
starts, the player must move down field and 
attempt to gain possession of the Plasmorb using 
the joystick and blast the Plasmorb to an intended 
direction. 
 
The player should also be aware that the Goldbeams 
move slightly every second and the distance 
between them will shrink. The highest scoring 
goals are goals made when Goldbeams have 
disappeared across the horizon (Over The 
Horizon/OTH shots). A player may also attempt to 
steal possession of a Plasmorb by rushing beside 
the opponent and blast the Plasmorb away. The game 
ends when time runs out or a player wins 10 
consecutive goals. If the game ends in a draw, 
over-time will apply and the first player to score 
will win the game. 
 
Scoring 
 
Close-in goals - 1 point 
Goals near Goldbeams - 2 points 
OTH shots - 3 points 
Players may steal points from each other by making 
goals. 
The total combined score of both players cannot 
accede more than 10 points. 
A player winning 10 consecutive points 
automatically wins the game.

West Bank (c) 1985 Sanritsu Denki Co., Ltd. / 
Gremlin Graphics Software Ltd. 
 
Bandits are holding up a bank and have taken 
people hostage, and as a gunslinger, it's your job 
to shoot them. The bank has 12 doors, and the 
bandits are behind each one of them. When they 
pull a gun out at you when you open a door, you 
have only a few seconds to shoot them before they 
shoot you. If you shoot them too early (ie: before 
he sticks his gun out at you), it is considered 
unfair, and you won't score any points, but if 
you're too late, he'll shoot you and you lose one 
of your three lives.If you waste too much time, a 
bandit will come out from one of the doors and 
stick dynamite on it. You must then shoot the 
dynamite to get rid of it. 
 
If you're lucky, either a man or a woman will 
throw you a bag of gold coins. If you shoot any of 
these people by accident, you also lose a life. 
More often than not, the person will throw his/her 
hands up, saying "I haven't got anything". That's 
when they will be replaced by bandits. 
 
Some men will carry three to five pieces of gold 
on top of their heads, and shooting at all of the 
gold will award you with a bag of gold coins. 
Others will be tied up with rope. If you shoot the 
rope, there's more money for you, because not only 
will you receive one bag of gold coins, but you'll 
get three bags of gold coins. 
 
There are more than ten rounds in Bank Panic, and 
each one ends when a person behind all 12 doors 
was able to throw you a bag of gold coins. The 
rounds get difficult the further you get. For 
example, in later rounds, a few bandits will block 
your shot, and you have to then shoot twice. Also, 
regardless of what round you're on, you can shoot 
so many bandits before time runs out.

then he will be able to determine if some are fake 
(as Ratigan has scattered 8 fake clues among each 
locale).  Fake ones must be dropped until all 5 
real clues are found then you get a clue to the 
level exit to go to the next locale.  If you can't 
find the exit, each clue can give a hint as to 
what direction you should go in. 
 
Your energy runs down as you go through the 
multi-level platform screens and encounter 
Rattigan's goons but some objects will contain 
cheese which restores energy or mousetraps which 
when laid in path of the goons will make them 
harmless (though they take up a pocket until 
used).

Batman (c) 1986 Ocean Software Ltd. / Ocean 
Software Ltd. 
 
Robin was repairing the Batmobile when he was 
kidnapped. Before Batman can contemplate rescuing 
him, he must reassemble the car from its seven 
parts. There are all over the Batcave, in this 
isometric arcade adventure taking in over 150 
screens. 
 
Initially Batman lacks his super powers, which 
must be collected. The Batbag allows you to pick 
up and drop objects, Jet Batboots allow you to 
jump, the Thruster allows Road-Runnering (movement 
while you fall), and the Low Gravity Batbelt keeps 
you in the air for longer. 
 
Short-term bonuses of invincibility, extra energy, 
and extra life and an enhanced jump can be 
collected, but there is also one which neutralises 
all power-ups. You have eight lives, but each 
cluster of Batstones acts as a restart point - 
when it is game over you can return to that spot, 
with lives and equipment as they were.

two, "Batmobile" (...the car): Joker is chasing 
you and have to escape to "Bat"-cave. Avoid 
obstacles like police blocking the road and 
others. Part three, "Bat"-cave: A puzzle game 
where you have to find a certain item (belonging 
to Joker) amongst other items. Part four, 
"Batjet": Cut the ropes of the balloons which are

Battle Command is a 3D arcade/strategy game, 
loosely derived from the same developers' Carrier 
Command. In a near future alternate reality, the 
Ultra War is fought between the two dominate races 
in the New World. The 'Mauler' is the latest 
technology - an Armored Fighting Machine capable 
of being lifted in and out of hostile territory by 
a fast Stealth Chopper, and armed with the most 
advanced weaponry science can devise. 
 
You command a single "Mauler" assault tank in one 
of a series of scenarios. These range from a 
railway ambush to escort duties and a raid on a 
riverside hideout. Before starting you must choose 
the right weaponry based on the mission briefing.

Battle of the Planets (c) 1986 
 
Battle of the Planets is based on a 
science-fiction children's cartoon series of the 
same name. Zoltar and his forces are attacking 
your solar system and its five planets - Xenath, 
Elias, Horaf, Olixal and Pete. As a G-Force space 
fighter armed with a Phoenix ship, you must repel 
each of these attacks, by destroying enough of 
Zoltar's craft to prevent the attacks from 
succeeding. 
 
The action unfolds through the window of your 
craft, with various types of enemy craft 
approaching and needing to be shot with your 
lasers or torpedoes. Once you have targeted an 
enemy, you must keep the enemy craft in your 
sights until it has been destroyed. There are five 
status screens to keep track of - shield strength, 
power stability, rocket status, laser status (it 
can overheat with constant use) and the current 
situation on the planet you are defending. 
 
To land on a planet you must fly towards its 
target on screen, and enter the docking bay. You 
will have to take out landers, using your rocket 
system. This is also your chance to repair and 
re-fuel your craft.

Battleships (c) 1987 Elite Systems Ltd. / Elite

What can you add to Battleship over the pencil and 
paper version? A computerized opponent, fairly 
obviously, as well as the chance to play without 
using up the earth’s limited paper and pen 
resources.  The possibility of cheating is removed 
as well. 
 
Elite go beyond this by changing the shapes of the 
ships to be more Tetris style, and allowing these 
to be placed at each of the 4 main angles. A 
‘Salvo Fire’ mode sees each player fire a 
succession of shots (each of your six ships gets 
four shots a turn until it’s sunk), meaning that 
strategic play involves firing on a wide range 
initially in the hope of finding a ship, before 
homing in on the area in the next turn. Finally, 
there’s an animated sequence for each go, which is 
depicted as an air strike. As well as standard 
two-player games, there’s also a multi-player mode 
in which the winner’s score accumulates until he 
loses, allowing for a “winner stays on” structure 
if there are 3 or more of you.

Battle Valley (c) 1988 
 
This side-view shoot 'em up involves trying to 
retrieve two nuclear weapons which have been 
stolen by terrorists. These are located at 
opposite ends of the playing area, so you can 
pursue them in either order. Needless to say, the 
terrorists have plenty of forces out to prevent 
you getting too far. 
 
Unusually, the game features both a helicopter and 
a tank - you choose either from the base, and can 
fly/drive back there to change. The best strategy 
is to use the helicopter to shoot out air-based 
enemies and repair the various bridges, then 
return for the tank. You get 4000 seconds in which 
to complete all this, and losing a life costs you 
500 of these.

A dictator took the control of a fortress on the 
island of Kuhn-Lin. 
 
Your mission is to storm the island and recapture 
it. This takes place over the course of 6 
different sequences. The first sequence is Aerial 
Reconnissance where the fleet must be moved 
directly past the enemy or into a hidden passage. 
Optional is this Hidden Passage sequence, where 
the player will have to manuever around mines and 
torpedos. Once encountering the enemy, the General 
Quaters sequence starts, where the player controls 
anti-aircraft guns shooting down enemy aircraft. 
The next sequence is named Battle Stations and the 
player must aim and fire heavy guns to aim at the 
enemy ships before they get too close. Following 
this fleet battle, the player's fleet must be 
manuvered to the beach. Upon reaching the 
Beach-head, tanks roll out and the player must 
keep these safe from enemy fire. In the Final 
Battle sequence, the Dictator is holed up in the 
fortress of Kuhn-Lin and 10 different targets on 
the fortress must be fired upon to destroy it.

The Dictator from the first Beach Head game is 
back, but World War 2 is over. Giving himself a 
new name, "The Dragon", he seeks revenge against 
the victorious allied forces. To further these 
ends, he kidnaps hostages and brings them to his 
island fortress... 
 
Controlling either the forces of the Allied 
Commander (J.P. Stryler) or the Dictator (The 
Dragon), you will have to perform objectives 
across four different sequences, each with 
different perspective and controls. 
 
In Sequence 1 "Attack", the allies invade the 
dictators base with soldiers dropped from a 
helicopter. The allied forces must land their 
soldiers and then march them forwards taking cover 
at different walls. The dictator only has to shoot 
them down with a machine gun. 
 
In Sequence 2 "Rescue", the hostages are being 
rescued. The player who controls the allies will 
use the machine gun to defend hostages as they 
cross the open courtyard. The dictator can deploy 
between four different weapons: Man on top of 
wall, Tank, Truck and Trap Door, only one of which 
is on the screen at any time. 
 
In Sequence 3 "Escape", hostages are loaded onto 
the helicopters. The allied player will select how 
to place hostages on helicopters and then man the 
controls, avoiding attack. The dictator chooses 
the level of the automated defense and then aims 
his tanks at the helicopter. 
 
In the final sequence, "Battle", the allied 
commander and the dragon finally encounter one 
another deep underground. They will toss poontas 
(throwing knives) at each other until only one is 
left standing.

Bells, The (c) 1986 
 
This is a fairly close copy of Ocean/Century's 
arcade platformer, Hunchback. Your goal is to 
traverse each screen filled with perils, so that 
you may reach the bell that is placed on the right 
side. The first screen contains only a ball or 
bullet that crosses the screen, which you must 
jump over. Jumping straight into the bell rope 
will kill you, however. The next screen has gaps 
which you must jump across, with the right 
distance in mind. After that comes a similar 
screen, only the pits are filled with pikemen who 
lower and raise their pikes. Timing is necessary 
in order not to be impaled as you jump over the 
pikemen. The fourth screen has the object from 
screen one hurtling across the screen, so your 
jumps across the pits must be timed so that you 
don't jump into its path. The fifth screen is a 
variation on the third, but with an arrow shooting 
over your head so that timing must take both the 
pikemen and the arrow in account. The game 
procedes in a similar fashion, with different 
combinations of projectiles, pikemen and pits. 
 
Your bell-ringer has two different jumps. One is 
for jumping up in the air, so that you can avoid 
projectiles, and the other one is a long jump for 
bridging gaps. Each screen must be crossed within 
a short amount or time, or Quasimodo will be 
struck by lightning.

gaps between roofs to avoid. The third part is a

simulation however. A helicopter is beamed back in 
time for our intrepid hero to use. You must first 
go to the Allied camp to get the secret weapon’s 
location (and you will need the password from part 
one of the game for this), and then head to that 
location to destroy it and save the world.

Big Trouble in Little China - Jack Burton (c) 1987 
Focus Creative Enterprises Ltd.|Software Studios / 
Electric Dreams Software 
 
In this tie-in to the 1986 John Carpenter movie 
starring Kurt Russell, you must thwart the evil 
plans of Mandarin Lo Pan who has kidnapped two 
green-eyed girls in order to marry and sacrifice 
them in order to become mortal again.  You play as 
3 characters, one at a time, in this action 
platformer: 
 
- Jack Burton, a burly but bit dumb action hero 
  who fights with fists and later with a 
  "Bushmaster" gun.  Ammo must be found to be able 
  to keep using it. 
 
- Wang Chi, whose girlfriend along with Jack's 
  has been kidnapped, uses Martial Arts and later 
  a sword when found.  More swords will be needed 
  as they will break after awhile. 
 
- Egg Shen is a magician who has vowed to stop 
  the ancient prophecy from coming about, and 
  fights with magic bolts which can turn later on 
  into more powerful lightning if magic potions 
  are found. 
 
Each character has an energy status bar at bottom 
of screen represented by a Yin and Yang Symbol 
that slowly disappears but can be replenished by 
finding food.  A weapons symbol is shown if they 
possess it and magic potion symbol will give them 
extra strength if found.  You must alternate among 
the 3 characters to keep their status from falling 
too low and dying, and each has to pick up their 
own appropriate weapons.  They all can move 
forwards and backwards, jump, duck and attack at 
different heights. 
 
They have to fight through several levels 
including the streets of Chinatown, where martial 
artist enemies await and gunmen that must be 
avoided until more experience is gathered. Further 
on, you go into the sewers where additional 
monsters must be avoided by jumping over them.  
Then they will reach the rooms of the underground 
lair of Lo Pan where large-hat wearing elementals 
called Storms await.  The final battle takes place 
in the Marriage chamber where armoured warriors 
and the levitating Lo Pan must be vanquished in 
order to free the kidnapped girls.

Birdie (c) 1987 ERE Informatique / ERE 
Informatique 
 
If you had dreams to be a bird, this game will 
make them true. Here you are a Birdie in some 
sci-fi world filled with robots, carnivorous 
plants, parachutes, raptors, barbarians, lasers, 
butterflies, magical doors, hyperspace, etc. You 
should survive in this world with help of your 
wings and flying techniques. 
 
The game is flown in third-person view, where you 
may control a bird moving him/her left or right, 
flying up or descending down, and flapping the 
wings. To fly correctly, the bird has to move in 
the air at a certain speed. Once the latter 
increases, the bird is handy. If bird's speed 
drops below a certain threshold, the bird then 
follows one of the oldest laws of the universe, 
gravity. Flapping wings enables bird to gain 
altitude and flying down on the wings increases 
speed. 
 
The scoreboard on the screen tells you your speed 
(red = stall), altitude, the remaining time before 
the night, your life energy (no energy = game 
over). Flying at altitude for too long will 
attract predators, give no points, and exhaust the 
energy unnecessarily. Eating butterflies allows 
you to recover energy, but remember that eating 
too much makes you aggressive! 
 
The environment, where Birdie is flying, will 
change during the game. Starting in the forest, 
you will visit other dimensions through Magical 
Doors as well as descend the dungeons, and even 
meet lamas.

Blade Runner (c) 1986 CRL Group PLC / CRL Group 
PLC 
 
Based on the movie of the same name. You have been 
assigned by the police force to track down and 
eliminate any replidroids that have landed on 
Earth. There are six types of replidroids, labeled 
Replidroid 1 through 6. The higher the number, the 
more intelligent it is. 
 
The majority of the game is viewed from inside 
your skimmer, and inside of your skimmer are three 
displays that you need to pay attention to. The 
main display displays a radar view of your area, 
allowing you to navigate the streets in search of 
replidroids (which are represented by octagons 
with crosses inside them). To the right of this is 
a smaller display which shows the whole city and 
your position in relation to the replidroid's. 
Below this is a text readout giving information on 
the number and type of replidroids within the 
vicinity. 
 
In the main display, your position is represented 
by a yellow cursor which you can use to navigate 
the streets with. If you find a replidroid, you 
can hover over it and press the fire button. Doing 
so will put you in pursue mode where you 
automatically land. 
 
After you get out, you must hunt down said 
replidroid in a busy street. There is a scanner in 
which you can use to keep track of where it is. 
The replidroid is represented as a green square. 
The further you progress, the closer you are to 
them. If the replidroid gets out of range, your 
skimmer automatically picks you up, and you have 
to hunt down replidroids elsewhere. Once you catch 
up with it, you must match your position with 
theirs and shoot at them in order to get the 
bounty displayed in the status bar. Your scanner 
also shows oncoming traffic that must be avoided. 
What it does not show, however, is people which 
you must dodge. If you crash into people, the game 
ends.

As the name suggests, this arcade conversion 
updates the basic Asteroids gameplay. That means 
to say that the main gameplay consists of flying 
through single-screen wrap-around levels shooting 
at rocks, which split into smaller rocks when hit, 
eventually becoming small enough to disappear. 
 
In this case the Asteroids are protecting Mukor, 
an evil being who is poisoning planets under the 
Colonising Corp’s control. 
Each level is split into either 9 or 16 
sub-levels, which are chosen through a square in 
which any remaining level which is adjacent to the 
last level completed can be selected. There are 3 
different ships (Speeder, Fighter and Warrior), 
which can be switched between at any time. 
Power-ups (including improved weapons, shield 
recharges and a faster thrust) can be collected by 
flying into them.

The main character in this old fashioned no frills

developers may have been lucky not to be sued 
over. The main player is surrounded by a large 
tank which moves around as if you are walking it 
Flintstones style. 
 
Gameplay follows the usual pattern for Ikari 
Warriors-style games - kill off the bazooka-toting 
baddies, which emerge from hiding places or enter 
the screen in waves. You can do this by either 
shooting them or running them over with your tank. 
Parts of the scenery often block your path and 
need destroying. Once you clear the level you are 
confronted by a boss, which in the first level is 
an enormous tank which you have to disable the 
guns of.

The game Bobo is an cartoon style arcade game. 
The main character is Bobo - controlled by you - 
he is an inmate and has been sentenced for 17 
years. 
In this game inmate Bobo must do many chores, such 
as peeling potatoes, ladling soup to his fellow 
prisoners, helping his fellow prisoners to escape, 
jumping electric wires and singing lullabies to 
his snoring cell mates. 
 
Besides playing all events it is possible to 
select and play just one event. 
Up to six player can play this game by entering 
their names. They play alternating not 
simultaneously 
 
Each event can be played by joystick or keyboard. 
The specific moves you have to make vary from 
event to event but it come basically down to 
moving the joystick or keyboard keys fast from 
left to right. To pick things up you have to move 
the joystick downwards (keyboard arrow key down). 
Tossing things is done by moving the joystick up 
(when using the keyboard you have to press cursor 
key up). 
 
Below you 'll find a brief description of each 
event: 
 
Bobo has a job in the prisons canteen. He must 
serve soup to the other inmates and keep their 
soup plates full. To do this Bobo must move around 
the tables. When his supply of soup is empty he 
must refill it at the top of the screen where a 
new supply of soup is available. If his fellow 
inmates demand more soup they  start banging and 
hammering on the tables. The score of this event 
is based on how many plates of soup he hands out. 
 
Peeling potatoes is not Bobo's favorite chore but 
he has to do it. He has to pick up a potato, then 
peeling it and when that's done tossing it away. 
Bobo scores points based on the number of potatoes 
he has peeled. If a potato is not fully peeled it 
will be tossed back. 
 
In the next event Bobo must help his inmates to 
escape prison. The inmates are jumping out of 
their cell windows and it is Bobo's task to get 
them over the prison wall by moving a trampoline 
around. 
The score is based on how many inmates actually 
can escape. Bobo must be sure to catch the inmates 
under the right angle with his trampoline because 
if he fails the inmates will crash into the prison 
wall. 
 
Finally, Bobo found an way to escape prison. He 
must jump from wire to wire and as the wires are 
electrified he must take care not to be 
electrocuted. The score in this event based on how 
long Bobo can prevent being electrocuted. Bonus 
points can be earned by picking up the green 
objects that appear occasionally on the wires 
 
In the last event Bobo has been captured by the 
police and returned to his cell. He can't sleep 
because his cell mates are snoring and to stop it 
he has to sing lullabies to them. He has to climb 
the beds and not wake his cell mates by stumbling 
around his cell. When all cell mates are fast 
asleep Bobo himself must go to bed to get some 
rest himself. The score in this event is based on 
the time Bobo is actually able to sleep himself.

So far the rather weak story for this typical

focuses not so much on combat but on avoiding 
rather unmotivated rolling barrels and flying 
insects and is remarkable mainly because of its at

After Bored of the Rings parodied JRR Tolkien's 
classic Lord of the Rings series, Delta 4 did the 
same thing with its predecessor The Hobbit, 
preceding New Line Cinema's identical sequence by 
20 years. There is a logical 3-part structure to 
the adventure, but there are also jokes such as 
the Old Ford location on the map being near a New 
Ford - a new Ford Sierra car. 
 
This interactive fiction with graphics game thus 
features reluctant adventurer Bimbo Faggins and 
devious magician Grandalf attempting to gain 
treasure, ultimately by appearing on a TV game 
show. VERB NOUN inputs are used for most 
instructions, although you have to TALK someone 
before SAYing anything to them. EXAMINEing objects 
is crucial to progress, and to finding the best 
jokes.

Bomb Jack (c) 1986 Tehkan Ltd. / Elite Systems 
Ltd. 
 
In Bomb Jack, the player controls Jack, who must 
collect all the bombs in order to complete the 
current round and go onto the next one. This 
sounds easy, right? Wrong! Making Jack's task 
difficult are numerous enemies such as birds, 
mummies, turtles, and orbs. 
 
In each round, collecting a number of bombs 
results in a bonus coin appearing, and collecting 
this coin will make the player's score increase 2 
to 4 times. More often than not, the "power ball" 
appears, and when you collect this, you can defeat 
enemies and have more time to collect all the 
bombs. There is also the "E" coin, which gives 
Jack one additional life, but rarely does this 
coin appear. 
 
The more you progress through the game, the more 
difficult it becomes, as enemies travel more 
quickly to get you.

Bomb Jack 2 (c) 1987 Elite Systems Ltd. / Elite 
Systems Ltd. 
 
Having saved the world in the first game, Bomb 
Jack is out to collect as much gold as possible, 
which is lying on a number of ledges. These vary 
between open and shut - the open ones offer more 
points, and an extra life is on offer for 
collecting 10 in a row, so if possible the route 
should take in the open ones in order. 
 
Gameplay differs from the original, in that 
Bombjack's movement is no longer free and 
self-propelled. Instead, he moves flick-style 
between ledges, so long as one is directly within 
one of the 4 compass directions. Baddies can be 
pushed off ledges, but this uses up some of Jack's 
limited energy.

Bomb Scare (c) 1986 
 
Bomb Scare is a single player maze based puzzle 
game. 
 
The Plot 
The game is set on Neptune where an enemy alien 
has planted a time bomb in the space station. 
The station has been evacuated and the player must 
neutralise the threat using a bomb defusing robot, 
ARNOLD. In order to accomplish this task, ARNOLD 
must first collect the necessary tools from those 
lying around the base. Then, when suitably 
equipped, the player must guide ARNOLD to the bomb 
in order to defuse it. 
Naturally the aliens will attempt to thwart this 
attempt whenever they can. 
 
The Game 
The mission to defuse the bomb is time limited, a 
mission timer in the lower half of the screen 
counts down from 999. If ARNOLD runs out of time, 
energy, or lives the game is over and the bomb 
explodes destroying the entire planet 
 
ARNOLD has six action keys. There are three 
movement keys, one key to move forwards and two 
others to rotate left or right, and three activity 
keys, pick up, select an object, and activate 
object. 
 
The base consists of a series of rooms which map 
to a 16 x 9 grid, though not all the elements in 
the grid contain a room. There is no in-game map 
but the rooms are coloured to assist the player in 
keeping track of their location. The game also 
displays large arrows on the floor when there is 
an exit off-screen, and smaller arrows on the 
walls when there is an obvious doorway. Some doors 
only allow ARNOLD to pass through one-way. 
 
There are eight tele-ports which allow ARNOLD to 
quickly move from one area of the base to another, 
but at the start of the game neither the player, 
nor ARNOLD, will have any operating instructions 
for them. 
 
ARNOLD's inventory can hold five items. When an 
object is encountered the player positions ARNOLD 
over it and uses the 'Pick Up' key, the object 
then appears in the inventory list at the bottom 
of the screen. The player then has to work out 
what to do with each object and where, within the 
game, it is used. 
 
As ARNOLD moves around the station he will 
encounter many small scurrying aliens. Some can be 
destroyed by running over them though this will 
sap ARNOLD's energy, others explode on contact and 
destroy ARNOLD. Points are scored for killing 
them, however ARNOLD only has a limited number of 
shots at his disposal.

Mobo and Robo Bonanza are enjoying their favorite 
television show when the picture crackles and a 
shadowy figure of a mysterious stranger appears on 
screen. This figure asks them to collect certain 
items that he has placed inside various buildings 
to test his security force. If they return the 
items successfully, Mobo and Robo will be 
rewarded. The two of them state that they will get 
the job done in just three minutes. However, 
little do they know that each building is packed 
with security guards who will raise the alarm if 
they are caught red-handed. Fortunately both Mobo 
and Robo are equipped with bullets that can knock 
the guards unconscious for a few seconds. An $100 
reward will be given out if Mobo and Robo are 
apprehended. 
 
As either Mobo or Robo, you must collect all the 
treasures before leaving the ten buildings and 
shoot any security guards that get in your way. 
Remember that you are under a time limit. An 
in-game map will help you locate the treasures. 
There is a bonus stage after three buildings, 
where the object is to collect the gold bars in a 
limited amount of time without  one of the three 
spotlights shining on you. If it is possible, hide 
behind open doors. If you manage to get all the 
gold bars, 10,000 points is added to your score. 
There are three of these bonus stages, but each of 
them varies.

Booly is a puzzle game with a similar concept to 
Gem’X in some ways. You are presented with a 
top-down view of an array of inter-connected 
blocks, which are shown in a variety of colours. 
The aim is to turn them all to grey, but clicking 
on them (using the pointer you are in control of) 
will often cause a pattern of other squares to 
change to the next colour in the sequence as well. 
You are doing all this with a time limit for each

Booty (c) 1984 
 
Like any good pirate ship, the old vessel upon 
which Booty is set is overloading with treasure, 
and you play Jim the Cabin Boy as he tries to 
collect as much of this as he can. The ship is 
viewed side-on in a platform-type perspective, and 
contains 20 holds, each of which is split across 8 
screens of treasure. Once you have cleared each 
one, you have 45 seconds to escape the hold and 
prepare for the next one. 
 
The levels all feature lots of doors, each of 
which has its own key to open it - these are 
numbered. As only one key can be held at a time 
(pick another up and the first one returns to its 
original location), and many of the enemies are 
located behind doors, a great deal of strategy as 
to which order you collect these in is required.

main quest involves meeting up with Legoland the

In keeping with the humour, familiar locations 
become "the featureless plain below the pink

Personal-Stereo-Wearing Goblins". 
 
Bored of the Rings is an interactive fiction game

The team's formation can be customised, and as 
outfield players are not limited to a single

and weaknesses in quite a precise way. Matches are 
played out by listing scorers as they happen, and

Obstacles in the caves include boulders, monsters

Software, S.L. 
 
The Brick is an Arkanoid clone embodied in the 
interior of a mechanic system. As such, you will 
have to help the racket (in this case, a nut), to 
impulse the ball in order to break as much bricks 
as possible, although there would be others that 
will be indestructible by your hit. To make your 
work more complex, there will be some flying 
enemies that will modify the trajectory of your 
ball and in the worst of the cases even shot at 
you, thus reducing your energy bar. In order to 
avoid being defeated by these creatures, you have 
one laser which just one projectile that recharges 
itself occasionally, so you will have to use it 
wisely too.

You are alone in Castle Frankenstein...well, 
you're the only person here, anyway. Scattered 
about the castle and its grounds are lungs, 
hearts, kidneys, and brains your beau Franky 
needs. You must use the joystick to move around 
the castle and find the parts that are needed. You 
must also locate keys to unlock doors. But beware, 
for while you may be the only person here, there 
are other dwellers within, such ghosts and 
skeletons. If they touch you too much, you will 
have a heart attack and die.

Bruce Lee (c) 1986 Datasoft, Inc. / U.S. Gold Ltd. 
 
The late martial arts hero features in this 
platform game, with the aim of reaching a wizard 
in an underground lair, defeat of whom can offer 
him untold wealth. 
 
In each area you must collect the many 
strategically-placed lanterns before exiting 
through the newly-revealed passageway. Some rooms 
also have escalator-type sections to run along, 
and the standard (although slightly illogical in 
this context) ladders. 
 
On the way, you'll fight two enemies - a ninja and 
a green sumo warrior named Yamo. You can defeat 
them by punching, kicking, dropping on their heads 
or luring them into hazardous terrain, or even by 
making them accidentally hit each other. Even 
after they are killed, however, they keep coming 
back for more after a few seconds. Since they can 
move pretty intelligently (they even climb 
ladders), you should watch out for them. 
 
There are lots of hazards to avoid by either 
walking round or jumping - walls of electrical 
charge and exploding bushes for example.

Bubble Bobble is the story of two humans, Bub and 
Bob who wander into the mysterious cave of 
monsters and magically turn into dinosaurs. The 
only way to transform back is to reach the end of 
the cave... 
 
Bubble Bobble is a platform game, with each level 
being a single screen. The enemies must be cleared 
from a level to go to the next one. With one 
player controlling Bub and the other controlling 
Bob, the player can jump and collect items for 
points (such as fruit). The real power Bub and Bob 
have however is the ability to blow bubbles. These 
bubbles can be as platforms to leap on, or to trap 
enemies. Enemies trapped in a bubble must be 
popped by jumping into them, wherein they'll turn 
to fruit. Additionally, power-ups sometimes float 
by in bubbles. They include lightning, which flies 
out horizontally at enemies, and water, which 
drags the player and enemies straight down flowing 
over platforms. Taking too long to complete any 
level will summon Baron Von Blubba, who will float 
around the screen trying to destroy the player.

(life-force) is drained for every move made, 
whether successful or not, and both this and your 
stamina level must be kept high. 
 
You can practice your skills alone, or spar 
against the instructors or your friends. Finally, 
when you feel you are ready, you can travel to the 
martial arts world championship tournament at

Buffalo Bill's Wild West Show (c) 1989 Tynesoft 
Computer Software / Tynesoft Computer Software 
 
Buffalo Bill presents a collection of six Wild 
West themed mini-games, which hang together around 
humour-lead presentation and backdrops.You can 
play as many or as few of these as you like, and 
can always have another go at them if you fail. 
 
First task is to throw knives at a spinning board 
upon which a surely-terrified and 
fortunately-skinny lady is locked  - make sure to 
adjust for the rotation that will occur in the 
time your shot takes to hit. You get points for 
missing as many times as possible before hitting. 
Event 2 is based on shooting ability and is in two 
stages. First you must shoot the targets of 
criminals (but not innocents) as they emerge from 
the ground, next you must shoot the bottles they 
throw at you from over the horizon. 
 
Event 3 is Calf Roping, in which you must position 
yourself so as to be able to throw your rope 
around the poor cow's neck. This is followed by 
Bronco Riding, in which you must adjust your 
balance to compensate for the Bronco trying to 
throw you off, by pushing the joystick out to 
balance two bars. Level 5 starts off like the Cow 
Roping, as you jump onto a Steer, before a 
joystick-waggling section starts. Last of all is a 
side-scrolling game in which you jump onto a 
stagecoach which has been invaded by Indians, and 
beat up the hijacker.

Bullseye (c) 1985 Macsen Software / Macsen 
Software 
 
A computer game version of a famed TV quiz show 
based around the game of darts. The computer 
version features 2 players, both human-controlled 
- on TV there were 3 teams of 2 (one amateur darts 
player and one to answer questions) 
 
The first round uses a custom board which is split 
both inwards (4 separate grades representing 
30,50,100 and 200 points respectively) and around 
(10 sections lettered A-K, representing a 
different subject each). The first player must 
choose a category to aim at, and shoot a dart at 
it. If they hit one of the sections for that 
letter, they get that score and are asked the 
question. If they hit another category they get no 
bonus but are asked that question - if it's still 
there. Each players gets 3 goes at this, with 
increasingly tough questions worth 30,50,100 
points. 
 
Round 2 involves each player throwing 3 darts at a 
standard board, with the player who scores the 
most getting asked a question, with the value of 
the darts on offer. If they get it wrong, the 
other player gets a chance, for the points THEY 
scored. This is repeated 3 times. 
 
After these 2 rounds, the player who is in front 
gets to aim at a board with 8 black segments, 8 
red ones and the bullseye. The bully scores 50 
points, the others reds score a randomly-selected 
value between 15 and 45, the blacks score zero, 
and hitting a red for the second time loses you 
that prize - hence the presenter's catchphrase 
"keep out of the black and into the red, nothing 
in this game for 2 in a bed". 
 
Once the player has finished the round, they 
choose whether to gamble their score against the 
final Prize Board. 101 points must be scored in 4 
darts (in the TV show it was 6 - 3 for each 
player)

Bully's Sporting Darts (c) 1993 Alternative 
Software Ltd. / Alternative Software Ltd. 
 
Do you like to play darts?  Would you like to have 
the opportunity to play darts on your computer?  
Here is your chance. 
 
This game offers seven scoring styles such as 
Golf, Cricket, and the normal 501 scoring style.  
Choose how you want to score the game and hop 
right in and play.  Aim your dart with your 
joystick or keyboard, then let it fly and hope you 
hit something good! 
 
The game automatically scores for you so if you do 
not know how to score a dart game, you can still 
play.  Knowing what you should aim for is helpful 
for getting high scores, however. 
 
The darts games included in this package are: 
 
1. 501 
This is the classic darts game where both players 
start with 501 points. Scores are reduced by the 
amount each player scores when it's their turn to 
throw. A leg ends when one player reduces their 
score to zero by hitting a double. A game is the 
best of three legs. 
 
Round the Clock 
The player must hit each number in turn, starting 
at one and ending with the bullseye. A game is the 
best of three legs. 
 
Football 
In this timed game, the number of each segment 
plays no part on this game. 
Each player has a designated 'goal' area. Players 
take it in turns to hit a sequence of beds 
progressing towards the opponents goal. The winner 
is the player who has scored the most goals when 
time is up. 
 
Tennis 
The player serving must hit doubles, the player 
receiving must hit trebles. 
A bed is highlighted on the board, this is the 
'tennis ball'. The server has two chances to hit 
their designated bed to 'serve' the ball. If they 
are in successful the point goes to the receiver. 
If they are successful the receiver must hit their 
designated treble bed. This is repeated until a 
player fails to hit the ball. Scoring is as in 
tennis. A match consists of the best of three 
sets. 
 
Golf 
Only the numbers one top eighteen are used in this 
game, representing the eighteen holes on the golf 
course. 
The object is to hit each number three times, 
hitting a double or a triple counts as two or 
three respectively, starting at one and working 
through to eighteen. The winner is the player to 
complete the game with the fewest darts 
 
Cricket 
In this game the players represent the batting and 
the bowling sides at cricket. 
The 'bowler' attempts bowl the batsmen out by 
hitting the inner or the bullseye, the inner takes 
out one batsman, the bull takes out two. 
Meanwhile the batting player attempts to score as 
highly as possible, but only points scored over 
forty count. 
The team with the most runs after two innings are 
the winners. 
 
Snooker 
All numbers count in this game, numbers one to 
fifteen represent the fifteen red balls on the 
snooker table, while the remaining numbers 
represent the colors, sixteen being yellow and so 
on through to twenty being black. 
To score, or pot a ball, that ball has to be hit 
by the player in sequence. The red balls must be 
hit once and the colored balls four times (doubles 
and trebles count as two and three hits 
respectively.) Play follows snooker in that after 
a red ball is potted a color must be attempted, 
hitting a ball out of sequence ends a turn and 
forfeits points etc. The player with the highest 
score wins.

Bumpy (c) 1989 Loriciels / Loriciels 
 
The first game in the Bumpy series is, just like 
its sequels, about a head that can bump a lot. You 
control whether the head shall bump left or right, 
and how far up it will bounce, across a series of 
bouncy platforms. Once you have picked up all 
items on the screen, the exit appears so that you 
can go on to the next screen. 
 
While most platforms are perfectly harmless, some 
have additional qualities, such as being 
destructible, thereby granting access to other 
parts of the screen. Some platforms are on fire, 
which will turn out lethal unless you have picked 
up a water droplet in advance. 
 
Bumpy was remade for 16-bit platforms as Pop-Up, 
and then ported back once more to the Amstrad CPC.

Butcher Hill (c) 1989 Imagitec Design Ltd. / 
Gremlin Graphics Software Ltd. 
 
Intelligence reports suggest that POWs have been 
captured and are being held hostage at the 
guerilla outpost on Butcher Hill. The game is 
divided into three sections. 
 
In the first section, players steer their dinghy 
along a river while avoiding mines and other 
obstacles. If the dinghy comes into contact with 
any mine, it explodes. However, when the player 
has collected ammo, the mines can be destroyed. 
Coming into contact with rocks causes the dinghy 
to bounce out of the water for a short distance. 
When a jetty appears, pressing the fire button 
allows the player to land and start the next 
section. 
 
The second section has the player finding their 
way through dense jungle whose path lead to the 
enemy camp at the base of Butcher Hill. Stopping 
you from proceeding are soldiers that have orders 
to shoot you on sight. Mines are also scattered 
around the jungle floor and must be avoided. If 
players were able to obtain a compass in the first 
section, their current direction will be displayed 
at the right of the control panel. Shooting all 
the soldiers in the jungle gives the player extra 
ammunition and stamina. 
 
In the final section, players need to destroy the 
enemy camp by blowing up huts with bullets or 
grenades. While they are doing that, they must 
also be on the lookout for any soldiers that tries 
to leave the camp to bring back more soldiers.

Cabal is a coin-op conversion of Capcom's arcade

The hero (there is a two player mode) runs back 
and forth along the bottom of the screen, ducking 
and dodging bullets and grenades from the enemy. 
The roll maneuver from the arcade was not 
implemented in the PC version. You return fire by 
moving a target around the screen which also moves 
your character, so be careful not to run into a 
bullet. 
 
The enemies throughout the 5 levels, come thick 
and fast and there are loads of them, normal foot 
soldiers, tanks, helicopters and end of level 
bosses, like submarines and war machines. 
 
Just about everything on the screen can be blown 
up or shot. There are bonus points to be picked up 
for destroying buildings and weapons to be picked 
up from the enemy, such as machine- and shot-guns.

Captain America - Doom Tube (c) 1988 Adventuresoft 
UK Ltd. / GO!|U.S. Gold Ltd. 
 
Your task is to infiltrate Megalomann's desert 
headquarters, the Doom Tube. This consists of 
three cylinders, one inside the other, each 
divided into several decks (levels) which are 
subdivided into quadrants (rooms). They are 
interconnected by an elevator, the Orbivator. 
The virus has, however, leaked into some of the 
rooms - some are more poisonous than others - and 
through the Captain has been injected with a 
protective serum, if a quadrant is too toxic it 
will kill him. The serum that keeps him alive is 
only temporarily effective but the ingredients to 
make more can be produced in the Converter 
quadrant. 
The Converter is activated by touching certain 
wall panels and placing sufficient quantities of 
Ying and Yang (the ingredients) in receiver 
plates. Ying and Yang can be obtained by blasting 
a doom pod found in one of the quadrants. 
You carry a nearly indestructible shield to 
deflect projectiles and nearly all energy beams. 
In some rooms, however, rotators are active and 
send out lethal beams. On destruction these 
rotators release a codeword which can be helpful 
in accessing later areas of the Doom Tube. 
If you can reach the final deck of the Doom Tube, 
you may be able to disarm the missile - but the 
game is played in real time, and you are given 
just one hour to save the world.

in this game are Sly Sludge (who is trying to turn

excess CFCs to destroy the ozone layer), Looten 
Plunder (who has kidnapped dolphins for 
experimentation) and Doctor Blight (who is 
destroying the rainforests). 
 
Controlling Captain Planet himself, you start off 
by flying into the screen, collecting time bonus 
and avoiding hitting stars. Once you've hit one, 
the main shoot 'em up body of the game starts. The 
Captain runs and flies, while firing a fusion of 
fire, water and air. He must stop those enemies of 
mankind by destroying their rockets, barrels of 
poison and their minions. Each level ends by 
facing them as bosses.

Carrier Command (c) 1989 Realtime Games Software 
Ltd. / Rainbird Software 
 
Carrier Command was one of the first real-time 
strategy games. 
 
You control an advanced cybernetic aircraft 
carrier complete with fighters, amphibious assault 
vehicles, laser defenses and a fleet of decoy 
drones.  Your mission is to build a series of 
resource, factory, and defensive bases spanning an 
island chain.  The only problem?  At the other end 
of the chain is an even more advanced carrier 
under control of a terrorist organization with the 
same mission. 
 
As you move around the islands you must decide 
what facilities to build and where they will best 
support your advance.  Resource islands provide 
materials that factory islands can use to build 
weapons and vehicles to replace your combat losses 
but both will be quickly overrun if the enemy 
attacks them while you are not present.  You also 
have to ensure that your stockpiles of equipment 
are stored safely until you can find time to 
launch a resupply drone to bring them to your 
carrier. 
 
From your carrier, you can take first person 
control of your attack aircraft and amphibious 
tanks and use them to assault enemy islands or 
even the enemy carrier itself if you're lucky 
enough to find it.  The weapon payloads on your 
vehicles are completely configurable based on your 
needs.  An island invasion may require launching a 
virus bomb that will take over the enemy command 
systems or just blasting the base with a wire 
guided surface to surface missile. 
 
Ultimately, you have to find and destroy the enemy 
carrier but, doing so will require a solid supply 
infrastructure and a strategy for depriving your 
opponent of his.

Castle Master is the fourth and final individual 
game to use the Freescape first-person solid 3D 
game system (after Driller, Dark Side and Total 
Eclipse). As a Prince or Princess armed with a 
slingshot, you have to explore a medieval castle 
to free your beloved from the evil Magister. 
 
Gameplay combines action and puzzle-solving, 
across four primary towers with three levels each. 
Doors must be opened using one of the ten included 
keys. These are unmarked, as are the various 
potions - making it a challenge to know which keys 
open which doors, and which potions are 
beneficial. 
 
Contact with ghouls drains your energy, as does 
falling too far (there are narrow pathways to 
negotiate), while eating cheese can replenish 
this. Movement and aiming are controlled 
separately.

Cauldron (c) 1985 Palace Software, LTD. / Palace

Playing a witch, you must assemble the six 
ingredients required to kill off your arch-rival, 
an evil pumpkin. The ingredients are all located 
in underground buildings, each of which can only 
be entered once you've found the appropriate key. 
The keys are located overground, and you must fly 
around on your broom to collect them. 
 
The overground sections play like standard shoot 
'em ups, as your broom is not affected by gravity 
and can fire bullets using your magic energy. 
Bats, fireballs and even seagulls are among the 
many creatures trying to stop you - contact will 
cost you more energy than shooting at them would. 
There are energy recharges on offer. 
 
Once you go underground, the gameplay becomes a 
test of precision platform jumping, including some 
Manic Miner-esque blind jumps. The six underground 
sections can be completed in a variety of orders, 
but you will sometimes reach points that cna't be 
completed without objects from other sections, so 
a lot of back-tracking is required. Although you 
start with nine lives, they won't last all that 
long at first.

An evil witch has brought evil and darkness to the

innocent pumpkins. As the poem in the instructions 
sheet explains, the only way to put things right 
is to capture a lock of her hair, then take it to 
the cauldron and cast a spell to undo things. 
 
Controlling the pumpkin is difficult at first, as 
it has a very high bounce, the exact level of 
which can be toggled using the 5 key. Direction 
can only be changed when the ball is on the 
ground. Ricocheting into enemies costs energy, and 
you only gain weaponry by landing into magic 
pools. The starting positions are random,  making 
mapping advisable and increasing the initial 
challenge. 
 
Even then, enemies respawn quickly, so all you're 
doing is buying a little time to pass them. Others 
can't be shot, and must be passed by possessing 
the right object - possibly one of the 5 you will 
ultimately need to vanquish the witch.

However, once you've caught up with your suspect, 
you are given more time. Your car is also equipped 
with turbo boosts, which you can use to gain extra 
speed if you are way behind the criminal. Each 
arrest is based on a "suspicion".

Chichn Itz (c) 1992 Aventuras AD / Aventuras AD 
 
Chichén Itzá is a Spanish text-adventure, the 
final "book" of the "Ci-U-Than" trilogy of games. 
They all utilize the parser DAAD, that has 
capabilities similar to the Infocom Z-machine one 
(you can chain commands, correct misspellings, 
etc). This time the main quest is divided in two 
parts: In the first half you have to satisfy all 
the gods demands while exploring the ruined temple 
and solving its mystery. In the last part you 
journey from hell to heaven in an effort to 
liberate the god Kukulkán from his prison. 
This was the last game of Aventuras AD, and had 
the misfortune of being released alongside the 
Monkey Island games. It was considered antiquated 
for its time, and was partially ignored by the 
public.

Chickin Chase (c) 1987 Jawx / Firebird Software 
Ltd. 
 
Players control a cock who is making sure that his 
wife delivers at least one of her children into 
the world. The cock automatically goes into the 
back room to mate with his wife, who lays an egg 
shortly afterwards. After this, it is up to the 
player to make sure that there is at least one egg 
among the two rows of nests, and that the egg is 
not destroyed by snakes, rats, raccoons, 
porcupines, and the like that are smart enough to 
climb the ladders leading up to the nests. 
 
The creatures enter the henhouse from either side, 
and must be moved along by pecking at them. As the 
cock walks around the henhouse, its energy will 
decrease. It must be replenished by eating chicken 
feed at both sides of the henhouse. Only then will 
the cock move faster. 
 
Upon entering the back room, the player must wait 
until one or more hearts appear at the top of the 
screen, as they indicate the number of eggs the 
mother will lay. Since there are ten nests, up to 
ten hearts can only appear at a give time. 
 
When an egg sits in the nest long enough, a egg 
will hatch out, and the resulting chick will make 
its way toward the back room, ring the bell 
outside the door, then go on in. If one of the 
creatures destroy an egg, or the only egg in the 
nest hatches out, the player loses a life, and the 
game is over when all lives are lost.

You have a first-person view of the robot 
currently under control. You start with a RAT

Watch out for the robot guards who shoot at you - 
try to find weaponry of your own. Only a small

He raised from the Hell and sighed. On his face 
the wrath of a demon and the ambition of thousand 
devils. He sprouted like a bad seed in the temple 
of Shaolin, whose walls lodged the best fighters 
of all times. The destiny has decided that the 
last hour for the good has arrived, because the 
yellow devil seized the original manuscript where 
Cheng Heung wrote the art of the Choy Lee Fut. 
 
Supported on the force of the five magical 
animals, the speed and the technique of a good 
apprentice, we will cross the temple of Shaolin 
until finding the monster and recovering the 
scroll. We are expert in punches, we handle the 
sabre with ferocity and make the flexible lance 
more penetrating and versatile. And all thanks to 
the Chi. As first action, we will have the 
possibility of training with the Dummies (the wood 
men), where we will practice the distance, the 
speed and the use of complementary techniques. 
From which we will get up ourselves into the 
dynamics of the fight and the confrontations 
hand-to-hand with the partisans of the evildoer. 
 
The movements are varied, all of them based on the 
Fung-Fu techniques. With different arms we will be 
able to execute different movements using the same 
keys. Everything depends on the animal that our 
personage will adopt. The graphical theme also 
changes according to the fight scenes, including 
the face of the old man that observes us.

In the game you play Hen House Harry who has to 
collect 12 (a dozen) eggs from each level, while 
avoiding the ducklings.  The levels each occupy a 
single screen, and are made up of platforms, 
ladders and lifts (or elevators), and are thus 
similar to those in classic platform game Donkey 
Kong.  Corn can also be collected, which stops the 
time limit from ticking down and also stops the 
bonus, collected when the level is completed, from 
decreasing.  The ducklings also eat the corn, 
however. 
 
There are only 8 distinct levels.  The ninth level 
is a copy of level 1, the tenth is a copy of level 
2, and so on.  However, on the second time around 
the ducklings that can use the platforms and 
ladders are replaced by the Mother Duck, who can 
fly around the level going through the platforms 
and ladders.  On the third time around, you have 
to face both the Mother Duck and the ducklings, 
and similarly on subsequent goes round, when there 
are more ducklings.

Chuckie Egg II is a sequel to platformer game 
Chuckie Egg, but is very different from the 
original game.  Whereas the original game features 
eight levels of one screen each, this features 
many more screens arranged into a maze for you to 
explore. 
 
In the game, Hen House Harry must build a giant 
chocolate egg, with the ingredients (cocoa, milk 
and sugar), that are found in the factory.  Eight 
of each must be included.  Also, the eight parts 
of a toy kit must be found, to place inside the 
egg. 
 
In order to get all the items you must find your 
way around the factory, avoiding many types of 
enemy, and solving puzzles using various items 
that you can carry.  There are a number of ways to 
get around the factory, including the platforms of 
the original, but also ropes and pipes, among 
other things. 
 
Despite the drastic changes from the original, the 
game still retains the sound effects from the 
original.

Cobra, the space pirate hero of Buichi Terasawa's

Dominique. Dominique is held prisoner by the evil 
Salamandar, and Cobra, along with his cybernetic 
assistant Lady (or Harmanoid, as she's called in 
the game's French), must rescue her. 
 
You start the game, and enter an isometric arena. 
You control both Cobra and Lady, each equipped 
with a gun. Shoot at everything that moves, and 
try to find the exit of the multidirectionally 
scrolling arena. As a backup weapon, you have also 
a set of five grenades to throw at troublesome 
enemies. Being hit once or twice is no problem, 
for you have a rather well-stocked energy bar. 
Controlling two characters at once means that you 
may be separated while rounding a corner or 
another obstacle, but the obstacles can also be 
used to regroup into a tighter or wider formation, 
depending on your choice of tactics. 
 
This tie-in uses a high resolution, at the cost of 
colours, to animate the screen with a high detail. 
Sounds is quite minimal, with no in-game music and 
simple sound effects. All in all, the game plays 
like a slower, isometric Gauntlet without the 
powerups.

Cobra's Arc is a curious conversational adventure

directly, we must choose the action to do by 
pointing to the available icons of the actions 
menu, therefore this is what could be called an

game, all of them surrounded in an atmosphere of 
fantasy and legend, so the action could take place 
in deserts, as well as inhospitable mountain 
ranges or mysterious walled cities. 
 
The plot of the game turns around a fabulous 
treasure, an immense amount of accumulated wealth 
during centuries by the priests of an old culture 
dedicated to the adoration of the god Cobra. 
According to the tradition, the temple where the 
priests jealously kept their jewels, diamonds and 
objects made with the most precious metals, was 
constructed on a ship, reason why it resisted the 
great deluge. 
Now the fortune hunters have as obsession finding 
at all costs the palace of the god Cobra. But for 
it, they will have to fulfill two objectives:

interconnected pipework (years before Sonic the

mark times have variable effects: stepping onto 
them reveals bonus points, objects, or a large 
weight that squashes Thing flat. 
 
As Thing takes damage from enemies or weights, his 
oil level is reduced. When Thing runs out of oil, 
he becomes rusted and the game ends. To move

Collapse (c) 1985 
 
Collapse is a simple puzzle game where players 
control Zen the Mole who is presented with a 
network of sticks that he must turn blue. Zen does 
this by simply walking over them while he is 
yellow. To get to the network, he must turn 
himself red so that he can build bridges that lead 
to it. Zen's redness disappears after a few 
seconds and he turns back to his default state. 
Once Zen has managed to turn the sticks blue, he 
can unleash the Rotox, a white line that moves 
around adjacent blue sticks, destroying them once 
the Rotox makes contact. When all the sticks have 
been destroyed, Zen proceeds to the next screen. 
 
The blue sticks must be destroyed within a time 
limit. While the player navigates Zen around the 
screen, two creatures walk around the screen, 
trying to make Zen's task difficult. Contact with 
either of these creatures result in Zen losing 100 
units of time. To deal with them, Zen is equipped 
with some magic dust that he can sprinkle on them 
to make them disappear and resurrect in their same 
position that they appear. Extra time is awarded 
to Zen by collecting jewels that occasionally 
appear on screen.

Colony (c) 1987 Icon Design Ltd. / Mastertronic

Mankind has established a distant colony, but the 
area is infested with ants, ladybirds and other 
parasites, all ready to cut through the perimeter 
fencing and eat your people's food. As a service 
droid it is your job to prevent this, and maximise 
the output. 
 
Achieving this involves a lot of planning and 
resource management. There are several buildings 
at your disposal, containing seeds, solar panels, 
weaponry, fencing and traps. You must plant the 
seeds, use the solar panels to maximise their 
growth, and then harvest the finished product so 
as to trade it. You can carry a gun to take care 
of the bugs, but this needs recharging frequently, 
and the location of the munitions store must be 
determined. 
 
When the bugs break part of the fence, you need to 
replace it to stop lots more coming through. This 
can be done more quickly by reducing the compound 
size, which causes the trade-off loss of growing 
room.

Colour of Magic, The (c) 1986 Delta 4 Interactive

The Colour of Magic is an interactive fiction 
adventure (with some graphics) set on Terry 
Pratchett's wildly improbable Discworld.  The 
world, a flat disc, rests on the backs of four 
elephants, who in turn stand on the shell of Great 
A'Tuin the Turtle.  Therefore, unlike some text 
games which use North, South, East and West, 
directions in Discworld are Hubward, Rimward, 
Widdershins, and Turnwise. 
 
Players control Rincewind the Wizzard, the fastest 
Wizzard in Discworld, who understands the finer 
points of survival (like it's not where you are 
running to, it's what you are running from).  In 
his adventure, based on book of the same name, he 
meets Discworld notables like Twoflower the 
Tourist, Luggage the luggage, and Death while 
saving Ankh-Morpork (again).

Contrary to what was expected, the new system is

confederation of planets XATOR sowing death and 
desolation. 
 
The only way to stop them is to destroy the

Comet Game, The (c) 1986 
 
Aimed to tie in with Halley's Comet passing close 
to Earth, but actually missing the boat by some 
time, The Comet Game is based on the idea of 
Halley's comet coming with bacterial life-forms 
capable of destroying life on earth. As a result, 
you must get into your high-tech spaceship, 
intercept the comet, and destroy those organisms. 
Controlling the ship's autopilot technology, you 
must ensure that the task is successfully 
completed. 
 
You must ensure that missile attacks on the ship 
are unsuccessful (by shooting at the missiles 
before they hit a your ship, a la Missile Command, 
controlling a cross-hair that moves around the 
ship), and maintain communication with Earth, by 
aiming the comms beam in the right direction to 
get the best signal. 
 
Keeping the computer running smoothly requires 
moving a line of LEDs to match what is being 
displayed. The fourth ongoing task is to keep the 
ship's crew happy. This is done in a rather 
surreal way, by brewing coffee and injecting it 
into the crew (who are in suspended animation).

Computer Scrabble (c) 1985 Psion Software Ltd. / 
Leisure Genius 
 
Computer Scrabble is the earliest official 
computer version of the popular word game. The 
game has an 11000-word dictionary containing the 
most frequently-used words in Scrabble. As a 
result, some very obscure words (mostly of 2 and 3 
letters - keen Scrabble players will know that 
these are often the most profitable scoring 
method) are included, but common words such as 
'bigot' and 'sheen' are queried by the game - 
simply tell it that your move is a word and it 
will move on trustingly. 
 
Inputting words is done by moving the cursor 
across or down to the starting position of the 
word, and then pressing to key the word in, 
pressing space before the letter you wish to use a 
blank tile as. All words formed are accurately 
scored. The game can juggle your tiles and allow 
you to manually rearrange them, and you can watch 
the computer 'think' as it notices possible moves 
and their scoring. There are four difficulty 
levels, with the highest capable of combined 
scores over 700.

This is a puzzle game where you must explode all

spark flows along a fuse, which is made up of a 
series of tiles.  These can be moved, in the 
manner of sliding puzzles, where there is only one 
gap, and tiles can be moved into the gap, creating 
a new gap.  The aim is then to move the tiles so 
the fuse forms a path from the spark to each bomb. 
 
There is a time limit, however, and extra time is 
knocked off if the spark reaches a dead end.  Also 
some levels contain water droplets, that 
extinguish the spark if they touch it.

Although Redham is armed with a small supply of 
daggers (more can be collected), these can only be

drawn large so that not much is seen on each 
screen. This means that a lot of advance 
route-planning is required, although most 
creatures can be killed by landing on their heads 
(horizontal contact with them is however fatal). 
The tarantulas are perhaps the deadliest foe, as 
they move so quickly. Treasure chests are located

will be killing us. Some of them will use all kind 
of deadly weapons, such as the famous saber or a 
blunderbuss. Luckily for us and unfortunately for 
them, our protagonist is quite capable when it 
comes to fight with punches and kicks. So if all 
goes well, you will find a small boat which is 
awaiting you at the other extreme of the island. 
 
The second part, to which we can access without 
the need of finishing the first one, takes place 
in a pirate galleon. There we will have to 
represent the role of the hero once again and we 
should try to rescue the beautiful damsel. Now the 
game system is quite different from the first 
part, because we will be no longer able to 
directly blow our enemies, but we will have to use 
a sword to finish with all of them. The objective 
consists in ascending to the pirate flags which 
are in the different masts of the ship and, in the 
end, to arrive where the girl is before she ends 
being food for sharks.

In the letters round, a selection of 9 letters is 
formed by alternately choosing a vowel or 
consonant, and the players have 30 seconds to find 
the longest available word. Generated letter 
combinations are not always realistic with the 
show. As in Computer Scrabble, the full dictionary 
is not stored in memory, so the game will ask if 
the words you enter are real. The longest word 
scores its length, with 18 points for a 9 letter 
word - both players score for equal length words. 
 
The numbers game also takes 30 seconds, and 
involves choosing 6 numbers from a set including 
25,50,75 and 100 as well as 2 each from 1-10. 
Choose how many large numbers you want, and the 
set is chosen randomly. A three-figure target is 
randomly generated, and you have 30 seconds to 
add, subtract, multiply and divide to get as close 
to it as possible. 
 
The conundrum finishes the show - it's a 9-letter 
anagram, which the first player to solve buzzes in 
to give his answer, scoring 10 points if correct.

Crazy Golf (c) 1984 Mr. Micro Ltd. / Amsoft 
 
Nine holes of chaotic top-viewed ricochets and 
hazards make up this early Crazy Golf game. They 
can be skipped for a score of 12 if you get stuck. 
There are no moving hazards, so gameplay is 
essentially a golf-themed precise positioning 
puzzle. Furthering this aspect, it does not matter 
what pace the ball it at when it reaches the hole 
(it never rebounds out of it) and that rebounds 
are always at precise 90-degree angles without 
taking pace out of the ball. 
 
Sixteen shot angles and sixteen shot paces are 
available. The first hole is simply a row of 
vertically-placed barriers with only small gaps at 
each end, but later holes include randomly-placed 
ball-sized blocks, curved barriers almost 
enclosing the hole, and square blockades leaving 
only narrow corridors to play (bounce, more 
effectively) the ball through. The final hole 
combines all these for a par-12 challenge.

After American Football players started cheating 
by using bionic parts, the game was forced to 
change its rules. By 2022, the game was played not 
by humans, but two teams of seven robots. To spice 
things up, the usual pig skin ball was replaced 
with a 350 pound bomb. 
 
Cyberball brings this fast and furious action to 
life. Gameplay is essentially the same as the real 
sport, although the 'downs' are replaced by the 
bomb's heat gradually increasing towards 
'critical'. After this it will explode and 
possession will be swapped. This is prevented when 
you cross the 50-yard line, lose possession or 
score a touchdown, in which cases it resets to 
'cool'. Field goals and punts are not featured - 
the only kick is the initial kick-off you receive. 
 
Control passes from the quarterback (thrower) to 
the intended catcher as soon as a pass is 
released. The two-player game is co-operative - on 
offense one player passes and the other receives

Using the range of weapon systems correctly is

which move around th edge of the screen before 
finding a target, and time-sensitive bombs which 
explode a few seconds after you drop them. Shot 
pirate ships release cargo, and you must collect 
at least 1500 points of this, but on many screens 
it is more prudent to make an escape ASAP, as some

you play the main events you have to train in the 
gym. Weight-lifting, squats and sit-ups are 
included, which involve waggling the joystick as 
fast as you can to fill a displayed bottle of 
Lucozade (clever bit of product-placement there). 
The better you do at this, the better you'll fare 
in the events, which are predominantly 
waggling-based as well. They include the standard 
decathlon events of running, jumping and throwing 
as well as you can. There are four types of shoes 
available, and choosing the wrong one for the 
event will seriously hamper your performance.

Ten sporting events (twelve on the 128K Spectrum 
version) are recreated in the second game licensed 
around the Decathlon champion. Each one has its 
own world record, and a target time / distance / 
score to reach - fail and you lose one of your 
three lives. After completing all events 
successfully they repeat with tougher targets. 
 
Rowing, 100m and cycling are pure tests of 
joystick waggling, and this is a feature of may 
other events. The penalty shoot-out involves 
timing the run-up then pressing fire to set the 
angle of the shot. In the ski-jump, timing the 
launch and landing are crucial. The tug of war 
involves choosing a candidate you feel you can 
beat and then out-waggling them. 
 
In the triple jump you must run to the line before 
holding down fire for the right length of time for 
each of the 3 phases of the jump (45 degrees is 
optimal). The hurdles event involves running to 
and pressing fire to clear the hurdles. 
 
Pistol shooting gives you limited time to 
correctly move a sight into position, before 
firing as close to the centre as possible. This is 
made harder by only being able to move up and 
towards the target, which prevents being able to 
correct over-movement.

available treasure. If this is done successfully, 
a code will be granted - put them all together at 
the end of the game. Foes are released in swarms 
through a control box. Once all these are dead you 
must destroy the box, to prevent respawning. 
 
The dungeons feature treasure, food (for energy), 
and spells. Be careful not to destroy these by 
shooting them. Each spell has a random function - 
disorientating, paralysing or killing the 
opponents on screen. Like Gauntlet you are 
constantly losing energy, however treasure can be 
traded in for energy.

Danger Mouse in Double Trouble (c) 1985 Creative 
Sparks / Creative Sparks 
 
Baron Greenback has created a clone of Danger 
Mouse, and needless to say his intentions are not 
good. Danger Mouse naturally springs into action, 
across 3 distinct stages of gameplay with platform 
and shoot 'em up elements. 
 
The first section involves flying along in your 
Aerocar, shooting as many of the bad guys as 
possible while avoiding as many as possible. The 
second involves avoiding contact with cats and 
monkeys, by jumping on the backs of crocodiles. 
The final section involves destroying the actual 
power unit for his Doppelganger in time to save 
Penfold.

You control a squad of high-tech tanks and you 
have to destroy the enemy squad. 
The tanks can move quickly, make sharp turns or 
fire in all the directions. 
 
The graphics in 3D are very well done for a 1990 
game. 
Even if the game has a rather simplistic plot it 
can get quickly very addictive.

Dark Sceptre (c) 1988 Consult Software Ltd. / 
Beyond - Challenging Software 
 
The game's set in the Isles of the Western Sea, 
where the Lord of the Isles has made a big 
McCock-Up. He forged the Dark Sceptre to defeat 
the invading Northlanders, but they seized the 
Sceptre and absorbed its power, becoming the Lords 
of the Shadow. The isles are now gripped by evil 
and ruled by the Sceptre, and the forces of the 
Isles must find and destroy the Dark Sceptre 
itself. 
 
There are seven teams of warriors roaming the 
Isles, each indicated by a colour. Umbrarg's 
Warriors are the Shadow Lords, and are red, while 
white marks your own team. The five sets of 
fighters in between should begin the game 
neutrally, and both you and the Shadow Lords can 
try to beat or befriend these warriors. As you 
think fit. 
 
Each team is made up of men of various qualities, 
from Thanes to Thralls. The Thane is the team 
commander, without whom the entire company will be 
more readily defeated. A Thrall is a simple 
underling, a pawn in comparison to other more 
complex characters like Mystics, Heralds, Savages 
and Assassins. Each has its own style of headwear, 
such has crowns, turbans and helmets. 
 
You have indirect control over your forces, able 
to tell them to scan an area for hostile warriors, 
keep an eye out for them, or carry out various 
orders. You can follow, protect, threaten or 
ambush warriors, use spells such as Charm and 
Petrify (turn to stone), or give or use objects.

Dark Side (c) 1988 Major Developments / Incentive 
Software Ltd. 
 
In Driller, the Ketars attempted to blow up the 
moon Mitral, but you stopped them. Now, they have 
Energy Collection Devices collectively known as 
EGOs, and hope to stock them up to use towards the 
Zephyr One device, and direct its energy at the 
planet Evath, resulting in a catastrophic 
radiation overload. 
 
Your mission is to beam onto their base on the 
moon Tricuspid, and destroy the EGOs. Destroying 
one will buy you more of your limited time. The 
problem is, many are connected to at least 2 
others, and those can immediately regenerate, so 
you must tackle them in an order in which those 
with only 1 connection are attacked first. 
 
You are inside a space suit, propelled by a Jet 
Pack with limited fuel, and possess lasers and a 
shield. Shield energy is limited, but can be 
recharged through pentagons and rods. In a world 
viewed through the the Freescape 3D system, you 
roam the verdant planet of trees, buildings and 
underground tunnels. 
 
Gameplay has more action than Driller. The 
Freescape world has a third dimension - due to the 
jetpack you can leave the ground and look down on 
the view. You can also rotate the angle and make 
quick U-turns. You must leave the ground to shoot 
the active part of an ECD, but the jetpack uses 
energy at a faster rate, so use this feature 
sparingly. You must avoid Plexors, which weaken 
your shield, and deflector devices, which can beam 
you into prison.

Billed as the fastest vector graphics ever seen on 
the Spectrum up to that point, and with full 
colour to boot, Dark Star has similarities with 
the Star Wars arcade game. Viewed from your 
cockpit, you fly the LIAR spacecraft around the 
galaxy, with the hope of achieving liberation, by 
destroying all the Evil Lord's main bases. 
 
You'll have to fly accurately through hyperspace 
tunnels, and keep moving so as to avoid enemy 
fire, ideally destroying enemy spaceports as well 
as planetary bases. There are plenty of energy 
dumps along the way, which you'll need to collect 
in order to be able to reach all 256 sectors. 
 
The game is hugely customizable, with almost all 
controls redefinable, and the speed and power of 
the enemy variable.

Deactivators (c) 1986 Tigress Marketing / 
Ariolasoft UK 
 
Deactivators is an arcade-puzzle maze game which 
puts you in control of a squad of bomb disposal 
droids. You must pick them up and quickly throw 
them out of the building to safety - failure to do 
this costs you a droid and a room (occasionally 
blocking off other essential rooms). The game's 
levels have grid-like arrangements with doors, 
trapdoors and poles, and increase in size as the 
game goes on. For both these reasons, mapping is 
essential. 
 
Security droids are on patrol, but these can be 
tricked into falling down holes. A computer room 
is the hub of your activities - this allows you to 
use teleports and turn off force fields, via the 
appropriate circuit boards which are hidden 
throughout the levels. On later levels the gravity 
isn't constant and you will find rooms with 
distorted directional senses, increasing the 
precision required significantly.

finally reaching Drax's palace itself. 
 
This is essentially a one- or two-player fighting

several kinds of hits, and some hits take off half 
a point while others take off a whole point. Each

takes the law into his own hands when he doesn't 
get justice and criminals get off.  This game is 
based on Death Wish 3 which came out in 1985.  A 
friend of Kersey in New York has been killed and 
he takes to the streets to help the police lay 
waste to gangs that are brutalizing and rioting in 
the city. 
 
He has a bulletproof vest that will protect him 
from several shots and can wield 4 guns: the 475 
Wildey Magnum, shotgun, machine gun, and rocket 
launcher.  Avoid shooting grannies on the streets, 
mean street-walkers and the police who 
occasionally will help you take out the baddies.  
If you start shooting policemen, they will turn on 
you too. 
The upper half of the screen shows you the 
side-view of the street or building you are in.  
The lower half shows your score, high score, 
injury meter, a scrolling police report so you can 
know where crime is taking place, a compass 
direction, a map which will also show you where 
weapons and bosses are located, and which weapon 
you are holding and the ammo left. 
When you enter a building, you can fire out the 
window for higher points but beware of enemies 
that may come up behind you.

Defender of the Crown puts you in the role of one 
of four Saxon knights in medieval England, in a 
time where the land is in turmoil as the King is 
dead and his crown was stolen. The Saxons and the 
Normans blame each other and fight for control of 
England. 
 
After a short introduction by Robin of Locksley 
himself, you start the game with a single castle 
and 10 soldiers at your command. From there, you 
have to build your army, take control of 
additional territories and fight the three Norman 
lords - and sometimes your Saxon friends as well. 
 
The game has several different styles: You may 
either engage in a jousting contest where you have 
to knock your opponent off his horse using a 
lance, you can go raid a castle for loot or you 
can attack another territory/castle. 
 
The game was originally created on the Amiga 
platform in 1986 by Cinemaware with wonderful 
graphics by James D. Sachs and great music by Jim 
Cuomo, then ported to the PC whilst keeping its 
original appeal and quality.

There's plenty of reflection in this game, in both

each of which will send the beam around the screen 
in different ways. 
 
Before the exit is activated, all the mines on a

them. There are other devices built into the 
levels, including teleports and random 
angle-changers, as well as hazards to avoid (they 
cause the beam to overheat) and droids which go

the Black Queen are out to stop you, including 
spiders, bats and goblins, and even the clouds and

Des Chiffres et des Lettres ("Numbers and

compete in a sequence of rounds challenging 
language and arithmetic skills. In this version 
you can turn off either type of rounds, and can 
have infinite time to think in each round, if you 
wish. 
 
In letters rounds, an array of 9 letters is chosen 
by each player alternately choosing either a vowel 
or a consonant, and players must find the longest 
possible legitimate word. In numbers rounds, an 
array of face-down numbers (including 25, 50, 75 
and 100 as well as 2 each of 1-10) is presented to 
the player, who chooses the number of 'large' 
numbers. A target between 101 and 999 is then 
generated, and players must get as close to this 
as possible. Additionally, there are mental 
arithmetic challenge rounds, in which players must 
solve an equation as quickly as possible.

Disc is a game of fast reflexes and clever

off the walls, opening a wide range of angles and 
attacks. You can also try a direct hit at your 
opponents, as enough of these will eliminate him

chance to block your disc, thus gain control of 
it! 
As you progress through the levels, from Novice, 
through Disciple, up to a Great Guide, your rivals 
become tougher, platforms take longer hits to 
disappear, and there are more discs on the playing 
field.

Dizzy Dice is a gambling game simulating a fruit 
machine. You start with a fixed amount of cash. As 
you play and get winning combinations, you'll have 
to choose whether to collect or gamble what you've 
won. After completing the fruit machine game, 
you'll get the chance to play a dice game where 
you have to guess if the next throw will be higher 
or lower than the current one. 
 
Dizzy Dice features two game modes. The first one 
you play as a normal fruit machine. But then there 
also is the bank mode, where you start with $20 
and need to reach $100 to break the first bank. In 
total there is five banks, each requiring more 
cash to win. The game is controlled using the 
keyboard.

Dizzy - The Ultimate Cartoon Adventure (c) 1987 
Codemasters Software Company Limited, The / 
Codemasters Software Company Limited, The 
 
Dizzy's world is being harassed by the evil wizard 
Zaks! You play as Dizzy, the anthropomorphic egg, 
and you must search the land for a Leprechaun's 
Wig, a Cloud's Silver Lining, a Vampire Dux 
Feather, and Troll Brew, to make a potion to 
defeat Zaks with. 
 
This is the first game in a long line of 
platform/adventure games starring Dizzy. In this 
game, like all Dizzy adventure games, gameplay is 
standard platformer fare, except there inventory 
items scattered around the world, which are 
necessary to overcome obstacles and progress 
through the game. The world expands in all four 
compass directions, items are frequently far away 
from the obstacles they are used on, and you can 
only hold one item in your inventory at a time 
(later games gave you more baggage space), so much 
backtracking is necessary! 
 
One thing unique about the first Dizzy game is 
that there are MANY more monsters and hazards in 
this one than in later Dizzys. Also unique is that 
some inventory items are used to destroy monsters. 
For example, one of the first inventory items you 
find is birdseed. As long as birdseed is the item 
in your inventory, you destroy any birds you 
touch. But this made it necessary to juggle items 
excessively often, so the concept was dropped from 
the sequels in favor of more inventory-based 
puzzles.

Donkey Kong (c) 1986 Nintendo Co., Ltd. / Ocean 
Software Ltd. 
 
Released in the arcades in 1981, Donkey Kong was 
not only Nintendo's first real smash hit for the 
company, but marked the introduction for two of 
their most popular mascots: Mario (originally 
"Jumpman") and Donkey Kong. 
 
Donkey Kong is a platform-action game that has 
Mario scale four different industrial themed 
levels (construction zone, cement factory, an 
elevator-themed level, and removing rivets from 
girders) in an attempt to save the damsel in 
distress, Pauline, from the big ape before the 
timer runs out.  Once the rivets are removed from 
the final level, Donkey Kong falls, and the two 
lovers are reunited.  From there, the levels start 
over at a higher difficulty. 
 
Along the way, Mario must dodge a constant stream 
of barrels, "living" fireballs, and 
spring-weights.  Although not as powerful as in 
other future games, Mario can find a hammer which 
allows him to destroy the barrels and fireballs 
for a limited amount of time.  Additionally, Mario 
can also find Pauline's hat, purse and umbrella 
for additional bonus points. 
 
Donkey Kong is also notable for being one of the 
first complete narratives in video game form, told 
through simplistic cut scenes that advance the 
story.  It should also be noted that in versions 
of the game for early 1980's consoles, Donkey Kong 
only used 2-3 of the original levels, with the 
cement factory usually omitted.

The lovely Marian was rescued from the clutches of 
the Black Warriors gang by Billy & Jimmy Lee in 
the first Double Dragon game, but now the gang has 
killed her in retaliation of their early defeat. 
The Dragons must now embark on a mission to avenge 
her death and defeat the Black Warriors for the 
second and final time. 
 
The original arcade version of "Double Dragon II" 
was essentially an improved version of the first 
game. In addition to offering renewed audio and 
visuals, as well as new traps, moves and enemy 
characters, "Double Dragon II" discarded the 
conventional punch and kick buttons in favor of a 
direction-oriented attacking system similar to the 
original Technos beat-em-up Renegade. 
 
The NES version offered new stages, new moves and 
illustrated cut-scenes, as well as a new final 
boss and a new ending. Unlike the first NES game, 
it offered 2-Player Co-Op gameplay with the option 
to turn off the friendly fire. 
 
The Game Boy version of "Double Dragon II" is an 
English localization of a "Kunio-kun" game (the 
Japanese franchise which inspired "Renegade" and 
"River City Ransom" and has nothing to do with the 
arcade and NES versions.

Zambaquous has done everything to make life hell 
for the people of Agamen, and as their King Kayus, 
the time has come to head out to destroy him. This 
leads to six levels of horizontally-scrolling 
shoot ‘em up action, although with some vertical 
movement as well. 
 
The thing which sets the game apart from every 
other horizontally-scrolling shoot ‘em up (except 
Saint Dragon) is that you are riding on the back 
of a dragon, called Bahamoot. Both you and the 
dragon have firepower, and holding down the fire 
button increases Bahamoot’s energy bolt’s 
ferocity. The dragon’s tail can be controlled 
indirectly, and because it is indestructible, it 
can be used either as a shield, or as a weapon in 
its own right. 
 
There are power-ups to collect by dismounting from 
the dragon and walking into them. These include 
fiery breath, bolts shot from Bahamoot’s tail, 
homing missiles of sorts, and lightning bolts, 
with only one ever active at a time. Each level 
has a time limit.

Drakkar (c) 1989 Diabolic Soft / Delta Software, 
S.L. 
 
Drakkar is an action game where you take the role 
of Erik, a viking that has been contacted by the 
gods and was told to to collect the three objects 
that will let him become the king of his people: 
the parchment of wisdom, the Caesar laurels and 
the trophy of war. But he will not face his path 
disarmed, the gods have given him a shield that 
will protect him from the Roman arrows. 
 
Erik has travelled back in time with a magical 
drakkar (the ancient viking ship) and has to pass 
a forest that takes directly to ancient Rome, 
where there are his goals, but first he must 
consult the gods (in the game presented in the 
form of dragons) as the order for collecting the 
objects varies depending on the game. 
 
Our hero is armed with a truncheon and shield that 
has been given by the gods, but the biggest 
drawback is that such a weapon (plus the axes that 
he can get later) serves only to certain enemies, 
while in other occasions he should just avoid any 
kind of contact with them. 
 
The first group of enemies, namely the ones that 
can be destroyed, belongs to bats and the Roman 
soldiers armed with swords, maces or arches. The 
second group belongs to snakes and rats from the 
forest, fish in the ponds, the notes to the angels 
of heaven, which in addition to subtracting energy 
to Erik, leave him immobilized at the mercy of 
their enemies, and chandeliers, that although 
lethal, can just be found in the rooms near the 
parchment. 
 
But not everything was going to be bad for Erik, 
and so, besides the shield of the gods and axes, 
he can also recharge part of his energy through 
pears and fish, succulent delicacies have been 
distributed for the comprehensive mapping.

"Drazen Petrovic Basket" is a game based on the

develops a basketball competition in the 
elimination mode, it is, you will start in 1/8

interesting point of the game is that all the 
teams are composed by five players: one guard, two 
forwards and two centers, everyone with the 
typical characteristics of his position and with 
the possibility of being controlled at every 
moment. There are also personal faults, so if 
anyone of your players gets the fifth one he will 
be expelled of the court, but that's not all, the 
game also allows you to request time outs, two for 
each game period, giving you the possibility of 
changing the tactics, seeing the game stats, etc.

magical weapons have limited ammo. 
 
The druid also has three other magical spells at 
his disposal - an invisibility spell which 
prevents the monsters from automatically 
approaching him, a golem spell which summons a 
helpful golem (which can be controlled by a second 
player), and a skull spell which destroys all 
on-screen enemies. The druid also carries around 
keys which open locked doors. But all these have 
very limited supplies. 
 
On his way, the druid finds many shops. Each such 
shop contains some keys or charges for the druid's 
spells, but the druid can only pick one item from 
each shop. 
 
The druid can also come across a pentagram on the 
ground which will restore his lost health.

Blood Valley (c) 1987 Imagitec Design Ltd. / 
Gremlin Graphics Software Ltd. 
 
A loose adaptation of the 1986 pair of fantasy 
gamebooks, this game gives a solo player the 
opportunity to control the actions of The Quarry 
(player's pick of barbarian, priest or thief), a 
slave who is once a year selected to run free 
temporarily, before being run down in the valley 
of Gad, hunted by its cruel ruler the Archveult, 
and tortured to death.  Survival is possible only 
through escaping the valley or slaying the hunter. 
 (A second player has the option of controlling 
the pursuing Archveult simultaneously in 
splitscreen mode.) 
 
The duel the game sets up is only the last of many 
threats -- the game imposes countless re-spawning 
enemies in the players' paths, needing to be 
endlessly slain with a tap of the attack button 
(and their random loot gathered with a tap of a 
different button) while remaining always on the 
move and attempting to achieve a shopping list of 
incremental objectives necessary for greater 
success, "helpfully" listed on the screen at all 
times in most versions.

Dun Darach (c) 1985 Gargoyle Games Ltd / Gargoyle 
Games Ltd 
 
Dun Darach may be the first ever videogame prequel 
– to Tir Na Nog. As such, it features the warrior 
Cuchulainn of Muirmethne, in a war against the 
Conachta. When he and his colleague Loeg meet a 
beautiful woman named Skar in an inn, they do not 
suspect that she is a spy, and will kidnap Loeg to 
the secret city of Dun Darach (the 'Oak Fort' in 
Celtic). Cuchulainn will not stand for this, and 
sets off to Dun Darach to rescue him. This will 
involve secondary quests being completed along the 
way. 
 
The game system is identical to that of Tir Na Nog 
– a single road of the city is shown at a time, 
which can be walked along to the left or right. 
When you come to a junction, the view can be 
rotated by 90 degree to allow this path to be 
followed. Gameplay is also similar - sword fights 
must be won and word-based puzzles solved, 
although unlike Tir Na Nog you cannot die. 
 
Trade and money management plays a bigger part 
than before - objects can be offered to, sold to 
and stolen from others, and you get obtain jobs 
for money. Watch out for Ryde the policeman - if 
he finds you with stolen goods, everything you are 
carrying will be taken. You must also speak to 
people and enter magic rooms to obtain key 
information.

Dungeons, Amethysts, Alchemists 'n' Everythin' is 
a text adventure with graphics - a parody of 
fantasy genre conventions that relies heavily on 
semi-adult puns for comedy. Written using Graphic 
Adventure Creator (which the game also parodies), 
it has a very basic parser, without most of the 
standard features of other parsers at the time 
(like the older and superior Infocom one). It does 
not support chain commands or pronoun recognition

Dynamite Dan 2 (c) 1986 Mirrorsoft Ltd. / 
Mirrorsoft Ltd. 
 
Implanting subliminal messages in music seemingly 
worked for Judas Priest - the evil Dr. Blitzen is 
trying to make it work for himself, by planting 
messages in popular records. Blitzen has used the 
8 islands of Arcanium for this task - each 
contains a jukebox as well as a record containing 
a clue to the location of the secret factory in 
which he produces these horrors. Dynamite Dan is 
back to put a stop to this, by exploring the 8 
islands in turn to find the pieces of the puzzle. 
 
There are 192 screens in total - 24 on each island 
- all loaded with enemies on fixed attack 
patterns. Some move diagonally, others home in on 
Dan, and some move horizontally - all of them 
detract from Dan's energy level, eventually 
leading to death and failure, and some can steal 
objects from him. The record and jukebox are 
randomly placed on each go, as are the enemies. 
Dan can jump far, and his jumps are bigger if he 
has taken a run-up. 
 
There are many objects to collect - a torch for 
theft protection, bomb goggles to blow doors open, 
foods for restored energy (and a mixer for 
infinite energy), and dumbells to increase jump 
size. All of these are used automatically. To 
escape each island he must also find enough fuel 
for his trusty Zeppelin.

Dynamite Dux (c) 1989 SEGA Corporation /

Side-scrolling beat 'em ups in which you must 
rescue a trapped female friend are nothing 
unusual. Being able to use direct-combat moves as 
well as collecting bonus weapons, and food for 
energy recharging, is pretty typical as well. 
Games of this type that were converted from the 
arcade to home computers are particularly 
commonplace - Renegade and the Double Dragon 
series are famous examples. 
 
Where this one stands out, however, is the setting 
of your character as a duck called Bin, and with 
motion having a clear waddling appearance. The 
enemies to fight are all from the animal kingdom, 
but somewhat warped - crocodiles with boxing moves 
and cows armed with rocket packs for example. Bin 
has six levels to clear before he can rescue Lucy 
from Archaca's clutches.

Software, S.A. 
 
Conversion of the Capcom arcade to home computers. 
The player adopts the identity of an ancient 
Chinese warrior, and riding on horseback has to 
eliminate all his opponents, mostly infantry and 
archers. 
 
The game uses a lateral scroll and the player can 
move in all four directions. A novelty is the 
attack system: when pressing fire the energy of 
the attack will load up as the warrior moves his 
spear up and backwards, in order to gain momentum. 
The more the player can keep fire pressed, the 
more powerful the attack will be. 
 
The game spawned a sequel in the arcades, 
"Warriors of fate", and is not to be confused with 
the PSX game of the same title, which is a 
one-on-one fighting game.

This is a fictitious adventure protagonized by "el

re-conquest of the Hispanic territories which were 
invaded by Moors, time period which starts on 722 
and ends on 1492 with the taking of the last 
Hispanic territory, Granada). 
 
But talking about the game, we are on the XI 
century, a dark time full of incessant fights 
between the the good and the evil. A legend whose 
antiquity was lost in the abyss of the times, 
assured the existence a parchment that, with being 
read by the evil forces, would trigger such big 
wave of disasters that Satan would be able to 
seize the Earth and assure its dominion as prince 
of the darkness. 
 
Our audacious protagonist, when knowing the legend 
of the parchment, was decided to recover it for 
the forces of the good, since the legend also 
affirmed that if this document would be read by 
two persons of good intentions, their effects 
would be annulled for ever. 
 
With this objective in mind, he began to search 
the magical key, that released the spell that had 
hidden the parchment. But the task was not going 
to be simple, like him, many horsemen had decided 
to find the parchment, some with glory anxieties 
and others by less worthy reasons. Luckily for 
Rodrigo (el Cid), the many years of fight against 
the Moors had fortified their noble arm, reason 
why the combats by sword are no secret for him.

Elevator Action (c) 1987 Taito Corporation / 
Quicksilva Ltd. 
 
You are Agent 17 (codename: "Otto"). Your mission 
is to secure all top secret documents from a 
security building and escape in the getaway car, 
located in the basement of the building. 
 
Enemies spies are scattered throughout the 
30-floor building and they have only one mission: 
execute Agent 17 at all costs. There are several 
ways in which Agent 17 can kill them: 
 
1. Shooting them with his gun. 
2. Kicking them by jumping onto them. 
3. Shooting a light on the ceiling while in an 
   elevator, dropping the light onto one of them. 
4. Crushing them with an elevator. 
 
Whenever a light has been dropped, the hallways 
will be dark for a short period of time, making 
the enemy spies harder to see. The same holds true 
for hallways that are already dark. 
 
While Otto is in an elevator, he will have 
complete control of it by moving up or down. Agent 
17 can still get killed if he's already in an 
elevator if a bullet's trajectory is aimed at it.. 
When Otto is not in an elevator, it will move from 
floor to floor automatically, even when enemy 
spies are in it. Otto is able to leap over the 
elevator gaps, but he must be as close to the edge 
as possible without falling off in order to make 
the jump safely. If there is an elevator cable in 
the way, however, it will block him, causing him 
to fall. 
 
Just because the game is called Elevator Action 
doesn't mean that elevators are the only means of 
travel. There are also escalators which you can 
ride up or down, useful if you want to avoid 
gunfire and don't have time to jump. 
 
Otto must go into the rooms with red doors to 
collect the top secret documents. If he tries to 
get to his car without getting all the documents, 
he cannot escape and must go back and collect the 
remaining documents. Once he has all the documents 
and drives away, he then proceeds to the next 
building. 
 
If Otto takes too much time to collect the 
documents, the alarm will go off, and he will have 
trouble controlling the elevators, which will take 
time to react. Bad guys will be especially 
aggressive. The alarm doesn't go off when Otto 
loses a life, it only resets after finishing a 
building. Besides ducking, bad guys may also drop 
themselves and lay flat on the floor. It's 
virtually impossible for Otto to shoot bad guys 
when they do this. Also, Otto cannot duck when in 
an elevator.

so in order to improve them we will have to chose 
difficulty level and then train flexions, 
displacements (with cones, flags...), ball 
juggling, dribbling, penalty shots, etc. 
 
And finally, on the second part (load), we will 
try to win the World Cup, for that, we will choose 
game length, control method and our team, then, we 
will be playing in one of the four (rather 
Euro-centric in composition) groups composed by 
Brazil, Argentina, England, Scotland, Wales, 
Ulster, Ireland, France, Germany, Holland, 
Denmark, Spain, Italy, Poland, USSR and Uruguay.

Empire! (c) 1986 
 
The ultimate goal in Empire! is to build a great 
galactic empire protected by a huge frontier 
shield. Before this can be achieved however, 
players have to complete various missions, trade 
with starbases and fight off invading aliens. 
 
The ship is controlled from a top-down 
perspective, with four gauges indicating its 
energy level, temperature, radiation level and 
shield status. When the radiation level or 
temperature reach maximum, the ship is destroyed. 
The ship heats up when it's near a sun or firing 
weapons. The radiation level rises when 
radioactive pods are carried. When the ship is 
running out of fuel, it can be refueled by 
collecting ore from planets. Two direction finders 
at the bottom of the screen point towards the next 
starbase, mission objective or manually chosen 
target. 
 
At starbases, players can accept missions and 
trade minerals, ore or people. These three goods 
can be found on planets (in form of pods). In 
order to land on a planet, players must enter a 
warp hole. Once on the planet's surface, the game 
switches to first-person perspective and the 
player has to dodge or destroy rockets fired at 
the ship and follow the direction finders towards 
pods or the "exit". Starbases need to be supplied 
with materials to be able to produce "performance 
pods" and equipment for the ship. 
 
In order to reach other star systems, players have 
to fly through asteroid belts. Although some 
systems can only be reached with a special 
hyperspace pod. 
 
Many star systems are overrun by aliens and can 
only be reclaimed when all aliens are wiped out. 
There are also systems that are infected with the 
plaque and players must take care not to spread it 
to other systems. 
 
As the game progresses, more aliens, better 
equipment and new starbases appear. When all 
systems have been visited, players can buy 
starbases. When all systems are owned by the 
player, the game can be finished by constructing 
the frontier shield.

Enduro Racer (c) 1987 SEGA Enterprises Ltd. / 
Activision, Inc. 
 
In this game you play the role of an endurance 
bike racer. The gameplay involves you racing 
against the clock to get to the finish line and 
jumping over ramps. At the end of each race you 
get points for how many cars or bikes you have 
overtaken with which you can upgrade your bike. 
There are various different terrain for you to 
race on including desert beach and dirt tracks 
plus a number of things to slow you down or even 
knock you off of your bike all together. The main 
idea is to find the best route through each level 
to shave off valuable seconds in order to over 
take more cars and bikes. 
 
The Japanese version of the game has more Tracks 
than the European and US versions have. Among  
them is a snow track which is one of the hardest 
tracks in the game, because there is a lot of 
stones on the thin road.

One hundred years after Hasrinaxx the Druid 
defeated the evil Acamantor, his nemesis is back, 
and although now older and having lost his Druid 
status after experimenting in black arts, he feels 
worthy of banishing this terrible foe. 
 
The gameplay uses a forced perspective top-down 
view, and strongly resembles Gauntlet in the way 
Hasrinaxx moves, shoots, avoids enemies and 
collects health items. 
 
Matters are more complex in terms of the spell 
system however. 32 spells can be collected and 
used, including a fireshield to allow you to pass 
fiery areas, water and fire walls to attack 
immediate enemies, a deathlight to clear the area 
of enemies, and a teleport. You can also summon 
one of 4 Elemental beings, who can be controlled 
simultaneously to attack creatures for you. Only 8 
spells can be carried at a time, but you can drop 
and later re-collect them.

Sury Ani 7 has been a source of mined resources

the only way to harvest its bounty is to do so 
remotely. Worse still, the security system of 
defence droids is active, and primed to damage 
anything which attempts to penetrate the surface. 
 
As such, you are in control of a Dedicated 
Disposal Droid in, which must eventually shut down 
the security system and clear the area of 
radioactive material. This is done by throwing it 
down the disposal chute on each of the 8 levels, 
but you only have limited time before they 
explode. Fuel is limited and must be found within 
the complex, with the retro-thrust move using it 
up particularly quickly. To reach the next level 
you must find the appropriate pass.

Crime is getting out of control in Liberty City, 
and to combat the problem, the LCPD establishes a 
new unit, called ESWAT (Enhanced Special Weapons 
and Tactics). Police officers who are promoted to 
this unit wear a cyber-suit that contains 
state-of-the-art military equipment including two 
Turbo-Booster Thrusters, extra ammunition, and 
increased protection. In order to become an ESWAT 
member, all a dedicated police officer has to do 
is arrest enough criminal masterminds to progress 
through the ranks, which include Captain, 
Assistant Chief, and Chief. 
 
ESWAT: Cyber Police is a horizontal-scrolling beat 
'em up where you have to make your way from left 
to right and defeat a mastermind. There are 15 
stages to complete, and have you patrolling 
through Liberty streets, car yards, stadiums, 
restaurants, the CBD, construction sites, and boat 
docks. While you're out on patrol, you can pick up 
ammunition, and the amount you get varies. For 
example, on some levels, ammo may be worth 10 
bullets, while in others, you may get 60 bullets. 
Once you have obtained the cyber-suit, you wear it 
for the duration of the game.

This action game combines shoot 'em up and

(hence the name). Your task is to progress from 
left to right in each level, either along the 
ground or by using the arrangement of platforms. 
Most of the baddies can be avoided rather than 
shot, and this is often easier, especially as you 
can duck or jump to avoid them. As well as a 
standard gun (activated by tapping fire) you also 
have a limited number of missiles to take out 
installations (activated by holding down fire, 
which makes autofire facilities useless). The 
scrolling is flick-screen, perhaps as the game was 
designed for the C64, and the Amiga version was 
identical to the ST's.

F.A Cup Football (c) 1986 Kerian UK / Virgin 
  Games, Ltd. 
 
F.A. Cup Football is officially licensed by the 
  English F.A, and lets you lead your English club 
  side to the FA Cup victory. First you have to 
  select your team and how many players will play 
  the game (maximum is 8). You can select 
  formation and between 3 different game 
  strategies, which are: attacking, balanced and 
  defensive. Sometimes you have to answer to some 
  questions where you have 3 choices. For example, 
  if your player wants to leave the club, what 
  would you do? 
 
Like in the real F.A Cup, your opponent will be 
decided by a random draw. Before each match you 
will see your next opponent. In the game you'll 
see all the fixtures, and watch how the matches 
are going minute by minute. If your team wins, you 
continue to the next round (unless it was the 
final). Drawn matches result in replays

Fairlight - A Prelude (c) 1986 Edge, The / Edge, 
The 
 
The land of Fairlight no longer lives up to its 
name, its culture and society having declined over 
centuries. The former ruler's castle Avars is 
shrouded in mystery, and Isvar chooses to 
investigate it. Unfortunately, he finds himself 
trapped in a mysterious castle from which he must 
escape. 
 
Viewed isometrically, Isvar's adventure features 
complex object manipulation: each object has its 
own physical properties and resultant 
characteristics in terms of how much else can be 
carried alongside it. The castle is guarded and 
full of trolls, who can weaken Isvar's energy - 
food and wine can restore it.

Fernandez is a despot who has invaded the Republic 
of El Diablo, bringing terror to the local people. 
The rightful leaders of the country have called 
you in to destroy Fernandez's hideouts and bring 
his country back to the people. 
 
Fundamentally this is a Commando clone, scrolling 
vertically and with hordes of enemies to be taken 
on, with finding good shielding spots and 
launching surprise attacks an especially useful 
strategy.You have unlimited bullets and limited 
but collectible grenades to use. There are 
landmines to avoid, and medical packs to pick up. 
 
On each of the 8 levels you must destroy 
Fernandez's buildings, which are accessed through 
an underground network of tunnels. You're not 
limited to being on foot - you start off in a jeep 
and can also use motorbikes, tanks and similar, 
although losing a life destroys this. In 2-player 
mode you can split driving and gunning duties. 
When starting a new game, you always start from 
the point at which you died in the last game.

After 20 years in space, the Orion has finally 
accomplished its task of galaxy mapping. Only one 
small nebula remains, but while making the 
intergalactic jump, the Orion is taken over by an 
alien race known as the Zimen. 
 
In an attempt to get rid of the Zimen, the players 
control four robots - Captain Slog, Plot the 
Navigator, Engineer Knut, and Able Spaceman Bodd - 
which they use one at a time. Each robot is 
situated in different areas of the ship. Some 
robots can easily navigate their way through the 
maze of 230 rooms, while others are temporarily 
trapped in their rooms. 
 
When a robot comes into contact with the Zimen, 
its energy is quickly drained. When all of its 
energy is depleted, the robot will stop 
functioning, and the only way it can be restored 
is if a passing robot transfers its energy with 
the non-functional one. 
 
The Zimen materializes suddenly in the Orion's 
passageways with deadly persistance, and can 
easily trap the outnumbered crew into a corner. To 
help them, the robots can throw bouncing bombs at 
the Zimen, gaining points when they have been 
destroyed. 
 
Control panels scattered throughout the ship give 
a robot access to code screens. When decoded, 
these will unlock matter-transmitters and lifts, 
meaning that the robot crew can move through the 
ship and closer to the ultimate goal: locking into 
the Bridge Computer. When all four have done this, 
the Orion will be safe.

objects left at his disposal, such as TV cameras, 
which provide valuable intel about each complex, 
the ammo crates, which contain weapons needed to

Fred has to paint  the walls as quickly as 
possible. To paint the walls Fred uses the tail of 
a living squirrel. 
Pebbles tries to leap out her playpen and starts 
crawling around and starts scribbling on the 
walls. If Fred wants to put Pebbles back in the 
playpen then he has to drop the squirrel, that 
immediately starts wandering off. When Pebbles is 
back in the playpen Fred has to chase the squirrel 
and dip its tail in the paint again. 
 
Part 2: Driving your car on the way to the bowling 
center. 
Finally, when all walls are painted Fred can go to 
the bowling 
alley! 
Fred has to drive to the bowling alley but 
unfortunately the roads are in a very bad 
condition. The road surface is dire and covered 
with rocks! 
And if one of the wheels hit a bump it will break 
off the car and disappear into the distance. 
 
Part 3: A bowling competition between Fred and 
Barney. 
At the bowling alley the following bowling 
parameters can be set: the spin and speed of the 
ball and the starting position of the player. 
Each turn gives two throws (except he gets a 
strike). A game 
takes ten turns. while a match takes three games. 
 
Part 4: Saving Pebbles at a construction site. 
On his way home Fred discovers that Pebbles has 
disappeared!  Don't let Wilma find that out! 
Fred finds Pebbles at a construction site on top 
of some 
scaffolding. He has to climb the scaffolding to 
rescue her. 
If Fred fails to rescue his daughter then Barney 
rescues her and Fred will be branded as a failure!

Fed up with football (soccer) management games, 
with all the match strategies, financial turmoil 
and prima donna players? This game offers a unique 
twist, leaving you 'managing' the career of a 
single player, involving matches and transfers. 
 
You start with 10 'goal cards' - up to 3 can be 
played in each match, each of them giving you a 
shooting chance, at which point arcade action 
skill comes in. The better you perform, the higher 
your wages are, the more chance you have of a 
big-money transfer and international call-up, and 
the less chance you have of being dropped from the 
team. 
 
There's also a trivia section, which asks 
increasingly difficult questions allowing you to 
go double or nothing on knowing the answers - up 
to £8000 a time can be won on this.

Players can be bought or sold, with their transfer 
values varying according to the size of any bid. 
Their skills and morale vary as the season goes 
on, with resting key players in easy matches often 
a key move. You can take out a loan, limited 
depending on your division, while day-to-day bills 
must be covered. Matches feature short animated

Football Manager from Addictive was the first game 
of its kind, and this sequel followed several 
years later, absorbing ideas from the many similar 
games released in between. Teams can now choose 
formations, and assign man-to-man marking. Players 
have individual skills and fitness ratings, in a 
more realistic way, with half-time substitutions 
and tactical changes supported. The whole 92-club 
league is incorporated, as is the League Cup 
alongside the FA Cup. It is now possible to watch 
and assess the individual performance of the 
players, with match graphics differentiating the 
attack / midfield / defense areas more clearly. 
Training allows passing length and height to be 
specified.

Formula One (c) 1985 CRL Group PLC / CRL Group PLC 
 
Shortly after Football Manager became a sensation, 
the sports management concept was applied to the 
high-pressure dollar-intensive world of Formula 1 
racing. The top six teams of the early 80s are 
featured (Ferrari, Williams, Renault and McLaren 
as well as the now-defunct Brabham and Lotus), and 
you can choose which one to manage. Your first 
tasks are to choose your two sponsors and two 
drivers, with all the day's top names as well as 6 
'rookie' drivers, who are cheap, but there's no 
guarantee of getting a good one. 
 
Once the game is properly underway, you must buy 
engine and chassis upgrades, and can improve the 
quality of your pitcrew - all of which eats into 
your budget. Your cars must be raceworthy to be 
able to race. After qualifying you must choose 
your tyres for each car - rain can be a factor, 
and the game informs you of the expected 
conditions before the race. 
 
The races are depicted via a timing board which 
displays the top 6 in the order, images of the 
cars flashing by (with a distinction made as cars 
come into the pits), and messages detailing 
crashes, spins and technical problems. Your 
drivers can be called in for pitstops, which 
involves moving a man around to undo each tyre in 
sequence, which is hardly realistic but does add 
some arcade skill and variation.

This interactive fiction computer game is based on 
the bestselling Cold War spy novel by Frederick 
Forsyth released in 1984 by Hutchinson publishing. 
 As the novel's hero John Preston, you have been 
appointed head of the C1(A), an agency of the 
British Secret Intelligence Service. You uncover a 
plot, named AURORA, to take power in the Soviet 
Union hatched by a secret faction of high-level 
minds.  In order to stop their plan you read a lot 
of info found in Top Secret folders, set wiretaps, 
monitor and interrogate suspects and informants, 
and gather facts and clues. 
 
The game has three main sections - The NATO 
Documents, The Bomb and The SAS Assault. A secret 
code must be gained in order to proceed from one 
to the next. Unique icon-based graphics provide 
the means to conduct your investigation though 
they're not mouse-clickable (you have to browse 
the icons using the space bar).  Interesting plot 
twists and developments happen during the game and 
are communicated to you with text-only 
descriptions.

Former boxing World Champion Frank Bruno, famed 
for his catchphrase "you know what I mean, Harry?"

depression, put his name  to this boxing game 
which replicates Punch-Out. As Frank, you must 
take on 8 progressively tough boxers to win the 
title. 
 
The action is viewed from right behind Frank in 
3D, meaning that you can see and feel the full 
impact of punches. A full range of moves is 
provided, with the standard jabs complimented by 
body punches and the ability to dodge, duck or 
raise your guard. 
 
Each punch weakens your opponent's strength, 
although going long enough without being hit can 
see this begin to recover. A rain of blows can 
produce a quick knockout, but in general you must 
hit him many times, and then with a knockout blow, 
to see him go down.

Freedom (c) 1988 Coktel Vision / Coktel Vision 
 
Freedom: Rebels In The Darkness is a game that 
combines elements of various genres like 
adventure, strategy, RPG and fighting games. The 
main character is a rebellious black slave working 
on a sugar plantation that tries to incite a 
revolt among the slave population to gain freedom 
and to give comeuppance to each of their old 
masters. 
 
At the start of the game there is four characters 
to choose, each with different statistics and 
abilities like "constitution" and "lock-picking". 
The main game screen is a map of the plantation, 
where you guide a small icon of the character 
while trying to avoid the guard dogs. If the dogs 
find you, they either bark and alert the owners or 
attack you. When they do, the screen switches to a 
first-person screen where you have to avoid being 
bitten and killed by the animal. 
 
On the top of the screen there is four buttons, 
each with a unique function: 
 
Path-finding lets you click on the map with a 
cursor and see a description of each hut and 
house. 
 
Movement allows you to move your character. 
Left-clicking shows a first-person view of your 
surroundings. This screen can vary depending of 
the place where you are in the map. Most of the 
time is the recruitment screen, where you click on 
your brother slaves to amass a army. Their 
response is a random "yes" or "no". If you click 
while on a sugar field, you get the option of 
climbing the huts, picking the storage hut lock, 
or setting fire to the premises. If you click 
while on the housings of the owner or one of his 
henchmen, you get the option of either confronting 
the person, or running away. If you decide to 
confront him, the screen switches to a side-view 
similar to fighting games like Street Fighter, 
with two energy bars at the bottom, where you have 
to fight one of the owner's men. If you win, you 
have the choice of killing the person or holding 
him captive. 
 
Review is the game statistics screen, where you 
can see your progress in the game. 
 
Advice only starts working once you get the 
support of either the shaman or the medicine man. 
They can heal any wound sustained by dog attacks 
and fights. 
 
The game accepts mouse, keyboard and joystick 
controls, and plays drum music and other sounds.

In Frost Byte you control Hickey the Kreezer, an

Cosmica, and rescue your brethren, within the 
limited 'Twang' energy you have. 
 
Cosmica is full of hideous monsters, many of which 
can be shot. Your character builds momentum as it 
moves, so some hazards are easier to clear from a 
running start. You can only jump vertically, 
although you have control as the character falls. 
Ammunition is limited, and must be collected 
throughout your quest. 
 
Three sweets which enhance your character can be 
collected - the red one increases your speed, blue 
increases the height of your leap, and green means 
you can safely fall further. There are additional 
objects to pick up and use as well.

Fugitif (c) 1991 Cristal Dream / Lankhor 
 
In the quite distant future, the universe is 
governed by an organisation known as the 
Foundation. You are Jack Bludfield, one of its 
former agents, now turned bounty hunter. You have 
now heard that your old partner, Xocann, has 
escaped from his prison planet. To exact revenge 
on Xocann, who once murdered your woman and left 
you to die, you take it on you to track him down. 
You start out in New York, where you must fool 
security guards and security systems, and track 
down someone who can give you a clue where to go 
next. 
 
For an adventure game, Fugitif uses a rather 
unique icon-based system. The entire screen is 
filled with still pictures of what you see, and 
you move from screen to screen using the cursor 
keys. All system messages are printed on the icon 
screen, from which you execute all commands bar 
movement. The command screen contains 20 icons 
which represent all the different verbs of your 
glossary. Double click a verb to go to another set 
of icons, representing all the usual objects you 
can expect to find. Apart from the 19 standard 
objects, more icons can pop up according to what 
can be found on a particular screen or in your 
inventory. It is possible to manipulate several 
objects at once with one verb, allowing you to 
build intricate actions such as moving a 
knocked-out guard's hand to an electronic lock 
requiring a particular biometric signature. On the 
other hand, the wealth of actions and objects 
available at all times can be rather overwhelming. 
 
Fugitif contains graphics drawn in the Amstrad's 
high resolution mode, which usually only allows 4 
colours, but innovates by extending the colour 
pallette using smart interrupt programming.

Full Throttle (c) 1985 
 
This early motorcycle racing game uses an enhanced 
version of the 3D Deathchase game engine. This 
time the view is from behind your bike, so this is 
visible on screen. The road itself moves sideways, 
a detail which is part of fairly advanced 3D 
routines for the time. Contact with the 39 
computer bikes will cause your bike to slow, and 
probably cost you several places. 11 circuits are 
featured, including favourites such as Spa, 
Donington and Misano. Races can be set for up to 
five laps, and times are recorded for comparisons.

Database Software / Database Software 
 
These six small educational games star Freddy the 
Frog. Each uses simple controls to ensure that 
children can play without difficulty from the 
software. 
 
Using forward, back, left and right keys Freddy 
must get to various important buildings as 
depicted on the screen. In Adding he is presented 
with a network of lily pads, some of which contain 
numbers or mathematical symbols. Land on these in 
the correct order to produce a correct sum. In the 
Toyshop, first identify toys from their names, 
then choose a toy at a specified price, and then 
combine goods to meet a specified price limit. 
 
Electricity allows you to learn about circuits - 
by working out whether an existing layout will 
work, and modifying it so that it will. The next 
game involves telling the time, so as to get the 
prince his key. Funtext teaches information 
searching using a Ceefax-type environment.

Controls primarily use the cursor keys and enter. 
 
Freddie is building a house, but can only add a 
log to his work if you solve a maths question. In 
the library, a list of book titles must be sorted

Successfully ordering letter and number sequences 
on the basketball court results in shots going in. 
Knowing which word is the opposite of the 
displayed one will help Freddy's diving.

Galactic Plague (c) 1984 Indescomp / Amsoft 
 
The Galactic Plague is an alien shoot up in the 
vein of Space Invaders. In this version each 
screen has between 4 and 20 alien craft of 
differing variety. Each variety of alien moves in 
a different pattern but always down and usually at 
a rate of knots, dropping bombs as they do so 
(often just one enemy can blanket the screen in 
bombs, almost inevitably causing the demise of the 
player). The ship controlled by the player is 
confined to moving along the bottom of the screen. 
The secret of progressing in the game was 
therefore learning the patterns of the aliens and 
learning where to place the ship to shoot down the 
various hordes without getting crushed by the 
hundreds of dropped bombs or colliding with an 
alien as it hit the bottom of the screen, where it 
just wrapped around to reappear at the top. 
 
The player only has three lives and many players 
found this game to be extremely difficult if not 
completely impossible after just a few screens, 
however, the game is completable. There are 
approximately 50 different screens and upon 
beating the last wave of enemies, the game goes 
straight back to screen No.1.

This strategic action puzzle game features 
original gameplay. You control a spacecraft 
situated on a globe which you can rotate and move 
around the screen. You must knock globes into 
others of the same colour, to rid the screen of 
all the globes. The screen has no borders, so 
globes can be pushed off the side of the screen, 
increasing your tactical range. Knocking globes of 
different colors into each other produces smaller 
pods which need to be picked up quickly, giving 
you energy, or they will turn into globes and you 
will have to get rid of them too. Many of the 
globes are linked to other globes (or the ship) 
via string, and the level layouts include barriers 
as obstacles (and ricochet points), making the 
Newtonian physics more complex.

After a fruitful day spent on his favorite hobby 
(food, what else?), Garfield the cat falls asleep 
next to Jon's still open fridge. The chill coming 
out of the refrigerator induces a dream of the 
Swiss Alps, with Garfield going after the largest 
lasagna factory in the world and a mythical 
chicken that can lay chocolate eggs. It is the 
player's goal to make sure Garfield's dream comes 
to a happy ending before he wakes up. 
 
Garfield: Winter's Tail comprises of three 
different mini-games.The first one has Garfield 
skiing downhill towards a ski-jump that will lead 
him straight to the rooftop of the lasagna 
factory. The second mini-game is set in the 
chocolate factory where the mythical chicken is 
employed: Garfield must ensure all the mechanical 
chickens in the factory are provided their 
chocolate supply flowing through a pipeline. 
Finally, he must ice-skate across a frozen lake, 
following the trail of chocolate footsteps left by 
the chicken. 
 
As a disturbing element, Odie appears throughout 
the whole game. The drooling dog can steal some of 
the food Garfield needs to replenish his energy, 
but he can also tamper with the lift controls in 
the factory and saw holes in the frozen lake. 
 
The three mini-games can be played in any order. 
However, playing the whole game from the skiing 
level first is the only way to be able to see the 
ending.

you way to the end of the level. One or two 
players must make their way through 100 levels of 
mayhem and magic. 
 
It featured a choice of four characters to play 
with, each with different weapons. Thor the 
Warrior, has a  bludgeoning battle axe, Thyra the 
Valkyrie, has a close range sword, Questor the Elf 
has his long range bow, and Merlin the Wizard has 
magical bolts. 
 
Ghosts, goblins and even the life draining Death 
are your enemies. Enemies stream out of 
generators, so destroy these before tackling the 
rest. 
 
Keys are needed to open the many doors within the 
levels, and in some situations a door will contain 
only bonus items, not a progressive route.  
Scattered magic potions act like smart bombs and 
clear the screen of all enemies. Beware of poison 
though, this reduces your energy level. 
Treasure is abundant throughout the levels and 
adds to your score.

League and cup tournaments are included, as are

(you have full control of these). The gameplay 
involves a number of advanced moves, and includes 
a gauge to control the exact dimensions of a kick 
(height and curl as well as strength), if you can 
use it quickly enough. Unusually, you have control 
over the goalkeeper, so can only blame yourself 
when you concede a goal. The players each have 
their own skills and strengths, and these develop

players become better, and more capable of facing 
better opposition.

Gemini Wings (c) 1989 Tecmo, Ltd. / Virgin Games,

Humans and aliens are living in harmony in the 
future, until a tabloid journalist stirs up hatred 
towards aliens. They respond by invading the 
planet, and it's down to you to clear up a 
situation scarily similar to reality in this 
arcade conversion. 
 
Gemini Wing is a vertically-scrolling shoot 'em 
up, which is distinguished by its unusual power-up 
system. Instead of gaining occasional tokens which 
lead to lasting weaponry improvements, occasional 
flurries of tokens are released to ensure a quick 
burst of improved fire. The organic backgrounds 
are detailed, and have many sections which fire at 
you.

Genghis Khan (c) 1991 Crom Software / Positive 
 
Genghis Khan is basically a strategy game, but not 
just. A very important part of your ability as 
governor will depend on your arcade experience 
when it comes to conquering the territories 
surrounding Mongolia. You mission will be to 
invade the Chinese Empire, and for that you must 
tear down the Great Wall using gunpowder. 
 
Unfortunately it will not be available from the 
beginning, so you will have to conquer Baghdad 
where the secrets of gunpowder manufacture are 
kept, and then dedicate your task in destroying 
the barrier that prevents you from the victory. 
But it will not be that easy, you will also have 
to defeat several enemies of varying difficulty. 
 
The game makes you choose between arcade, strategy 
or a mixture of both. In the first category you 
must use the joystick to defeat the owner of the 
chosen land. The screen turns into a 
side-scrolling game in which a Mongol warrior, 
sword in hand, must face the enemy hordes. Each 
soldier you kill equalizes to five in total, and 
every blow you receive means a loss of five units 
of yours.

Ghostbusters (c) 1985 Activision, Inc. / 
Activision, Inc. 
 
Based on the movie of the same name, the 
Ghostbusters are the ones to call who will "bust" 
any ghost hauntings. It does this through the use 
of nuclear accelerated "proton packs" and traps, 
whereby the ghosts can be captured and transferred 
to a secure storage facility. However New York 
City has suddenly become a very haunted place, and 
the number of ghosts has suddenly increased. The 
Ghostbusters must reduce the paranormal (PK) level 
in the city, representing ghost power, before the 
Temple of Zuul awakens and ressurects an evil 
goddess, Gozer. 
 
Ghostbusters is an action game that combines an 
overhead view and a side-view. From Ghostbusters 
HQ, the player must monitor the map of New York 
City for "ghost alarms" as well as casual spirits, 
and plot a route to the alarmed area. The player 
then controls the Ghostbuster vehicle as it drives 
through traffic. Here, the player is able to 
capture casual ghosts on the way if they are en 
route. Once at the location, the game switches to 
a side-view. Two of the ghostbusters will take 
position and activate their proton beams and toss 
a trap to the ground. The player will attempt to  
maneuver the ghost(s) over the placed trap. Once 
activated, the trap attempts to capture any ghosts 
directly above it. Successful capture will earn 
the player money, which can then be used to 
purchase new Ghostbusters vehicles and new 
modifications for the vehicle. Unsuccessful 
capture will see the ghost fly away. 
 
As the game progresses, the PK energy of the city 
increases. Ghostbusters must keep it under 
critical levels by being constantly  successful at 
ghost captures. Eventually the Temple of Zuul will 
activate, and if the PK levels are still 
manageable, the Ghostbusters can venture there for 
a final showdown with Gozer.

Gold Ltd. 
 
Three years have passed since Arthur defeated the 
Demon King Astaroth and rescued his beloved 
Princess Prin-Prin (see Ghosts 'N Goblins). A new 
villain, the Great Demon King Lucifer (Loki in 
some versions) has become the new leader of Ghoul 
Realm. While returning from a journey, Arthur sees 
the Princess' castle and her village under attack 
by Lucifer's forces. While rushing towards her 
beloved knight, the Princess is struck by one of 
Lucifer's laser beams. 
 
Now, Arthur must venture back to the Lucifer's 
palace and destroy the demon in order to rescue 
the Princess' soul and bring her back to life! And 
it won't matter whether he fights in his shining 
armor or in his underwear alone...the bravest 
Knight in the land isn't going to be stopped by 
some monsters! Although the game starts with 
graveyard and marsh territory familiar from the 
first game, later levels are set in a tower, a 
mass of skeletons, and a castle. 
 
Players progress from left to right (from bottom 
to top in level 3), and have to hack down the 
aforementioned monsters with a sword. The journey 
includes ledges, ladders, lava pits and slippery 
slopes. Different weapons can be collected, by 
finding suits of armor inside chests. Each of the 
five stages has its own setting and a final boss.

world at peace. It confiscates a horde of planes 
and warships, and as a UN loyalist, it is your job 
to shoot them down. Solving starvation and disease 
can wait, apparently. 
 
The game is split into 8 stages, which are split 
into sub-stages over land and sea, each of which 
has a strict time limit, and a target number of 
planes to shoot down. They take place from behind 
your plane, which can be controlled with ‘up’ 
referring to ‘climb’ or ‘dive’, depending on 
player preference. You are armed with 10 missiles 
as well as standard weapons. The plane can survive 
a few hits, so watch the damage report as it goes 
from red to black. 
 
Fail to complete a section in the time limit and 
you use up a continue, but the amount of planes 
previously shot down is not reset, making the 
second attempt easier Chase HQ style. As you 
destroy enemies you gain access to better planes, 
and the rank reported at the end of the game 
improves – this is also dependent on the skill 
level you play at.

Goonies, The (c) 1986 Datasoft, Inc. / U.S. Gold 
Ltd. 
 
Datasoft's The Goonies is one of the most 
fondly-remembered games in the genre of platform 
action-adventure-puzzle games for which Datasoft 
was known (other games included Conan: Hall of 
Volta, Bruce Lee, and Zorro, all well-regarded 
classics). 
 
The game is licensed from the 
internationally-beloved Steven Speilberg film of 
the same name, in which a motley crew of suburban 
kids in Astoria, Oregon, must save their homes 
from being foreclosed upon and find their 
salvation in a treasure map leading to an old 
pirate ship in a cavern.  However, they must 
maneuver around an eccentric family of Italian 
criminals -- the Fratellis -- on the lam, who are 
also on the trail of the treasure. 
 
The game is divided into a series of eight screens 
based on scenes from the film, each of which 
contains unique and creative puzzles that must be 
solved by coordinating the activities of two of 
the kids from the Goonies (and in the last screen, 
the elephant-man-like Sloth) without getting 
killed by deadly bats, homicidal Fratellis, flying 
demon-skull thingies, or other environmental 
hazards.  For example, in one screen one player 
must wind up and hold a winch that lifts a large 
stone so that the other player can pass it, run 
backward on a ball floating in deadly water, 
bypass a series of three water buckets going up 
and down that kill you if you do not time your 
passage underneath correctly, jump to the top of a 
rail, and slide across to grab the key to the door 
below -- and all this without getting hit by a 
wandering bat. 
 
One of the characteristic elements of this series 
of games is that it was organized more like an 
arcade game than an adventure game

and save them. Along the way you'll be able to 
power up your ship with hyper speed, force fields, 
lasers, missiles, double beam cannons and more to 
help you battle. Based on the arcade game, Gradius 
is a side scrolling shooter. Shooting certain 
enemies will leave a power up pod behind which can 
be collected to add more power to your ship. Each 
level features a wide variety of enemies trying to 
stop you, with a large boss at the end. Gameplay 
is for one player or two players alternating.

championship. It was licensed around Spanish ace 
Jorge Martinez 'Aspar', and your (and his) racing 
rivals including future 500cc World Champion Alex 
Criville. 
 
The game features a full practice mode as well as 
qualifying and races. There are only 8 computer 
bikes, although the real life championship points 
system is used, meaning that the penalty for not 
finishing is bigger than in real life, especially 
as you only have 5 bikes to last the season. The 
game is viewed from overhead, and the controls 
are, unusually, direction based, so to take a

going up and to the right, you must push the 
joystick in that direction.

Great Escape, The (c) 1986 Denton Designs / Ocean 
Software Ltd. 
 
The Great Escape is an isometric action-adventure 
game. 
 
Gather round, kids, and listen to grandpa tell of 
his time as a prisoner of war in Germany. ‘Twas 
back in 1942. Those were rough times, lads. Rough 
times. Been shot down in my plane. Darn shame it 
was, it being a good plane and all. Next I know, 
there’s this group of German soldiers standing 
round me, and off we go to a P.O.W. camp. Big 
thing, that, plenty of guards all around with a 
keen eye on your every move, and full of 
unfortunate souls like myself. Just that they do 
naught but sit all day and sob and generally be no 
great help when it comes to doing the Great 
Escape. But not me, no sir! I showed them Germans, 
I did, and I was out of their fashionable high 
security “he who comes here, stays here” camp in 
no time. You wanna hear that story? Bet you do! 
 
Controlling a prisoner of war in a German camp, 
your goal is to break out undetected. There are 
numerous ways to freedom – back doors, cracked 
fences, even underground tunnels. However, you 
have to plan your escape while obeying the strict 
rules of the camp. 
 
Number one: Daily program. You have to attend two 
roll calls a day, one meal, one exercise, and stay 
in bed at night. Failure to appear at any of these 
events will result in the alarm being rung. When 
you do not touch the controls, your protagonist 
will move automatically, going to all important 
events. You have to detect and use gaps in the 
time-table to explore the camp. 
 
Rule number two: guard rooms are off limits. If a 
soldier catches you in a room that is forbidden, 
you will be placed in solitary confinement. Of 
course, you have to enter restricted parts of the 
camp to find items crucial for your escape. The 
moral flag will turn from green to red to indicate 
that you are in an area where you shouldn’t be. 
 
Rule no three: no prisoner may carry forbidden 
objects. When you are caught in a suspicious 
situation, you will be stripped of all items that 
you found so far. To avoid that, you have to 
deposit objects in a safe place. You need to find 
keys to open locked doors, uniforms for 
camouflage, flashlights to see in dark tunnels, 
and many more. 
 
Rule number four: guard commands are to be obeyed 
at all times. The German soldiers patrol on fixed 
routes and have a line of sight. You have to learn 
the guard’s routes and sneak past their backs to 
avoid detection when breaking out. If you are 
caught, your morale will decrease. If your morale 
reaches zero, your will to escape is broken.

Unfortunately, Catheter gets word of your plans, 
and mixes up a whole new batch of vicious

destruction and avoidance. 
 
Elite's implementation of this is a five-level 
side-view action game, in which you run around 
avoiding or shooting the gremlins. Each level has 
a secret object which must be collected. Bonus 
items such as extra lives and time can be 
collected, as can improved weapons, and credits to 
spend on a new weapon after each level.

Gremlins - The Adventure (c) 1985 
 
Based on the movie of the same name, Gremlins: The 
Adventure is an interactive fiction game by Brian 
Howarth, author of the Mysterious Adventures 
series. Players take the role of Billy, who has 
already been tricked into feeding Gizmo after 
midnight, and now Kingston Falls is in danger of 
being overrun with Gremlins.  With Gizmo's help, 
Billy must save the town before it is too late. 
 
There are some animated graphics in this one.  The 
game has less than 50 locations, though time is a 
factor - the gremlins home in on Billy with every 
move he makes, so there is no chance to dawdle. 
The design means that deaths are more frequent 
than in most adventures. It uses the same parser 
as the other Adventure International games of this 
era.

Gun.Smoke is a top-down scrolling shooter that 
   casts the gamer as a lone gunman, out to save

   Wingates. Each level has a particular target 
   enemy, although his or her henchmen must also 
   be taken out. 
 
Although it largely takes place on foot, the 
gameplay resembles Commando, with its top-down 
action. The screen scrolls at a constant rate, and 
enemies come at you from the edges, to be shot or 
avoided. You can grab various power-ups along the 
way. Finding a horse will allow you to get hit 
twice before you die rather than just once. There 
are scenes in which you raft up a river and use 
the tracks of a railway line. 
 
On the NES you can tap the A button to fire up and 
right, the B button to fire up and left, or A and 
B simultaneously to fire straight ahead. 
One-button control systems mimic all this.

fixed isometric 3D, with hazards including 
buildings, ramps and drops. The gyroscope 
accelerates quickly and takes time to slow down, 
so it is easy to go into a screen too fast. 
 
Failing to keep the gyroscope spinning freely as 
it navigates these costs you one of your seven 
lives. You are also playing within a time limit - 
losing a life sees you return to the start of a 
level without regaining lost time, but running out 
of time sees you lose a life, but be able to 
continue from where you were left with a new set 
of time (so, as with Chase HQ, completing tricky 
levels can take 2 or 3 lives at first). 
 
You get time bonuses for completing a screen, 
points bonuses for completing one of the seven 
four-screen levels, and an extra life for reaching 
1000 points. 
At the end of level 7, you will get 1000 points 
for each remaining lives, doubling your current 
amount of lives. You will then start again at 
level 1 but mirrored by the vertical axis (you are 
now climbing from the bottom of screen to the 
top). 
After level 14 (level 7 mirror), you will again 
win 1000 points for each remaining lives and then 
the game loop on level 1 (not mirrored).

Hacker (c) 1986 Activision, Inc. / Activision, 
Inc. 
 
Hacker is an adventure/trading game based on what 
was then a unique idea. You're starting into the 
adventure as a real hacker would do, lacking 
information of what is to come, only driven by 
your ambition. Consequently, the game opens with a 
plain text screen, prompting you for the login 
password. To break into the system is the first 
puzzle you've got to solve. 
 
Once in, you'll soon find out that you've 
accidentally stumbled upon a conspiracy of global 
impact. From then on, you'll maneuver a robotic 
drone around the globe through a tunnel system 
deep in the earth. In major cities, you may 
surface and talk to contact persons, who'll trade 
items for cash. When delivered to the correct 
city, you can exchange these items for a piece of 
evidence. If all evidence is collected, you're to 
inform the FBI. As if figuring out the correct 
routes and trades wasn't hard enough, frequent 
system malfunctions and security checks test your 
skill as well...

Hacker II (c) 1987 Activision, Inc. / Activision, 
Inc. 
 
Hacker II: The Doomsday Papers is a real-time 
strategy game. 
It is the sequel to Hacker 
 
Once again you hack into a computer system, just 
to end up saving the world. Hacker II: The 
Doomsday Papers opens with the console to the 
"Actisource" computer hotline system (a nice 
self-ironic pun - although nobody knows why a 
serious hacker might want to crack a help service 
for computer games...). However, your quiet little 
hack is soon disturbed: The government wants you 
for a secret mission. It, again,  involves a robot 
drone and you're the one at the remote control. 
Although this time, it's not the whole globe 
that's your playground, but a high security 
facility in Russia, where the plans for global 
domination are hidden. 
 
In fact, all you've got to do is to guide your 
drone to the vault on a 2D map of the building. 
However, there are two major obstacles: Patrolling 
guards and security cameras. To avoid detection, 
you've got to trick the observers. By tapping the 
surveillance system you can see what cameras are 
currently active and which rooms they monitor. 
Your task is to bypass the video signal of the 
right cameras with a taped recording of an empty 
room, so that your drone is hidden from the view. 
You control four monitors, which you may freely 
switch to show the security monitor, the radar 
map, VCR output or one of the 38 cameras -- thus 
keeping an eye on guard movement while 
simultaneously controlling your drone and 
synchronizing recordings to cameras. Whew, sounds 
like a lot of work? It is.

Halls of the Things (c) 1985 Design Design /

Using the gaming engine and graphical style that 
would be seen again in The Warlock Of Firetop 
Mountain, Halls Of The Things places our 
adventurous hero in a randomly generated tower. A 
long hallway with seven doorways in it at the 
start offers the player the opportunity to enter 
dungeon areas of varying difficulty (easiest and 
more open at the top, hardest at the bottom). In 
these areas of the tower, the player can explore, 
finding treasure and elixir bottles (which can be 
used to replenish the player's magic). Of course, 
things aren't that simple. The Things roam the 
various corridors and will chase and attack the 
player on sight, even going so far as to disguise 
themselves as ordinary objects until the player 
comes in range. Fortunately, the player has sword 
and bow, as well as magical spells, to defend and 
heal himself. Will this be enough for you to raise 
a fortune in loot or will The Things see you to 
your doom?

Hammer Boy is an average arcade game that plays 
like a cross between Kaboom! and Whack-a-mole. 
 
Armed with a big hammer, your job is to prevent 
the American Indians from reaching the tower 
behind your fort by hitting them on the head and 
putting out the fires that are thrown from the 
side. That's really it to the game -- new levels 
bring different backgrounds (battleship, castle 
and space base) with corresponding enemies 
(pirates, knights and aliens), but essentially the 
same gameplay. 
 
This game is based on the comic book hero.

Hard Drivin' (c) 1989 Atari Games Corporation / 
Domark Software Ltd. 
 
Hard Drivin' is a 3D arcade hit from Atari Games. 
You are in control of a high-performance sports 
car. Your objective is to race around the course 
as fast as possible and hit as many checkpoints as 
possible. If you hit a checkpoint you gain extra 
time to go farther. You will see traffic on the 
road both in your direction and coming down the 
opposite direction, so be careful when you pass... 
 
The course has two sections: speed track, and 
stunt track. Speed track is longer, but you can 
usually achieve higher speeds. Stunt track 
requires you to perform several stunts such as 
jumping bridges, driving through a loop, and so 
on. 
 
Crashing the car has no serious consequences and 
indeed shows a replay of your crash from a 
cinematic angle. Admire your crash head-on into 
the cement truck, or clipping the minivan, or 
flying off the bridge in the wrong angle... You 
lose several seconds as your car is "reset" and 
you get up to speed again. 
 
The home conversions retain most of the 
then-advanced 3D graphics but lack the 
force-feedback that was in the arcade version.

Hawk Storm is a brave warrior living on the planet 
Edos, and its citizens look up to him for 
survival. Edos has only one source of energy: the 
giant capacitoid crystals, capable of storing 
energy by day and regenerate that energy during 
the icy cold nights. Having realized this, the 
evil Nevik warriors decided to steal all but two 
of these crystals, making it impossible to sustain 
normal life on the planet. As a result, all of the 
people are forced to go in a Life Suspension 
Program, except Hawk, who must recover all 
thirty-two stolen crystals if Edos is to survive. 
 
The Neviks are scattered throughout Edos to make 
sure that Hawk does not succeed in his quest, but 
Hawk can collect up to three different weapons – 
shields, mines, and stryders – that can be used 
against them. Also scattered around are various 
hazards such as firepits, slimeballs, spikes, and 
gun turrets, which can cause Hawk to lose some 
energy if he collides into them. There are several 
objects which Hawk can use to his advantage. 
Energy pods can restore his energy, lifts can be 
used to reach higher platforms, and teleports can 
take him to different areas.

Your people's clones are trapped behind an

into cycles through in sequence. On each level a 
set number of these must be rescued. 
 
The difficulty is that a swamp lies between the 
fence and the safety zone, and it is constantly 
spawning creatures who kill you on contact. You 
are armed with bombs with kill in a direct 
downward trajectory, so will be using the top area 
of the screen a lot. Although you can slot into 
one of the home-cells and wait for the sequence to 
cycle round, this runs the risk of becoming 
trapped in the section as the swamp-creatures 
encroach. The colour of the swamp things dictates 
the score but not the difficulty. On later levels 
there are static hazards on screen, as well as 
enemies firing at you.

save them. As Roderick Hero, you need to make your 
way through the dangerous mineshaft avoiding the 
dangerous creatures and lava, and find out where 
the miners are located before you run out of 
energy. To help on your mission, Roderick Hero has 
several useful types of equipment. A prop pack 
will allow you to hover and fly around the 
mineshaft and (hopefully) avoid the many dangers 
within. Your helmet features a short range 
microlaser beam which can be used to destroy the 
bats, spiders, snakes, and other creatures you'll 
encounter in the mines. From time to time, your 
path through the mine may be blocked by stone or 
lava walls. You begin each mission with six sticks 
of dynamite which can be used to destroy these 
obstacles (be careful you don't blow yourself up, 
though!) If you run out of dynamite, your laser 
beam can also be used to destroy the walls, though 
this will take longer and use up more energy. As 
the levels progress, the mine shaft will become 
longer and more maze-like, creatures will more 
frequently block the path, and lava walls and 
pools will appear which are dangerous to the 
touch.

Heroes of Karn (c) 1984 Interceptor Micros / 
Interceptor Micros 
 
A long time ago, before the rise of the empire of 
Karn, evil creatures attacked the lands of Beren, 
the last of the Mountain Kings. Only four men, who 
would become known as the four heroes of Karn, 
survived the massacre and managed to flee. 
However, they were soon caught and put under a 
spell. The player takes on the role of the 
legendary Stranger from "a land where men can fly 
and machines can think", and must rescue the four 
heroes and retrieve the treasures of the realm. 
 
Heroes of Karn is an Interactive Fiction game with 
graphics and more unusually, music. You can type 
in commands to manipulate objects, solve puzzles 
or attack enemies. While it is not possible to 
have conversations with NPCs, you can give them 
orders to do certain tasks.

Hero of the Golden Talisman (c) 1986 Mr Chip 
Software / Mastertronic Ltd. 
 
The town of the game's hero is under a curse from 
an evil wizard. He has stolen the Golden Talisman 
that had protected the city in the past. Broken 
into five pieces, the Talisman is hidden in a 
labyrinth filled with monsters. Now the hero has 
to find all five pieces of the Talisman and 
destroy the evil wizard in order to restore peace 
to the city. 
 
The labyrinth is explored from a side scrolling 
perspective. It is composed of 64 room spread over 
five levels. Each room is 8 screens large, 
providing a total of 512 screens to explore. The 
goal of each level is to find a piece of the 
Talisman while fighting off lots of different 
monsters ranging from birds to jumping eyeballs to 
fire-breathing dragons. 
 
The hero can jump, climb ropes, swim and shoot as 
well as pick up different power-ups and objects. 
He can carry five objects, but only hold/use one 
at a time. Pressing the space bar changes the 
object in use. Usable objects include keys, ropes, 
lamps to light dark rooms, flags that improve the 
hero's firepower and others. 
 
Power-ups can be collected to replenish health or 
air. If the hero runs out of air, being underwater 
will slowly decrease his health. To help the hero 
finding his way through the labyrinth, a map is 
shown at the lower left side of the screen. It 
marks all visited rooms, shows his current 
position and indicates whether there are any items 
in a room.

The famous fantasy-themed board game was converted 
into an isometric-viewed role playing game in 
which the evil Wizard Morcar must be defeated. You 
take control of a wizard, a dwarf, a barbarian and 
an elf, each with different strengths and 
weaknesses, who each start the 14 missions from 
opposite sides of the board. 
 
Strict turn-based movement rules apply, as actions 
other than movement can only be carried out before 
or after the move, the size of which is limited by 
a dice roll. These moves are carried out using an 
icon-based system. Characters can fight the many 
monsters which lurk, or cast spells to vanquish 
them. There are magic potions to uncover, but also 
hidden traps, so mapping is advised. Treasure can 
be collected, and traded at the shop after each 
level.

Activision (UK) Limited 
 
When High Frontier was created, America was 
investing heavily in the original 'Star Wars' SDI, 
to fend off a feared Soviet missile attack. Your 
job in this strategy game is to oversee its 
development. 
 
The game is played via an icon control system, 
with a common set of icons and information panels 
are displayed around these screens. There are six 
distinct screens used to make the decisions, plus 
the ability to track existing satellites and keep 
track of active Soviet attacks. 
 
The Research & Development screen is the first 
port of call. It is split into six components, to 
which you must assign money and staff. The 
President will give the order to arm or disarm 
your units (including the activation code). Once 
you have working SDIs and the permission codes, 
you can launch them using the Shield screen. 
 
Espionage and Reconnaissance cameras are located 
to keep track of enemy development, although these 
figures are not always precise. The Threats screen 
lets you keep track of enemy resources and moods. 
The World screen effectively moves the game 
forward in time.

Highlander (c) 1986 Canvas / Ocean Software Ltd. 
 
The 1986 cult film Highlander is the basis of this 
adaptation, which reduces the film to its 
swordfighting scenes. Taking the role of the 
immortal Highlander Connor MacLeod, the player has 
to win three consecutive battles against 
increasingly skilled opponents: MacLeod's teacher 
Ramirez, a character named Fizir, and finally the 
mighty Kurgan, the main antagonist of the movie. 
 
A battle is won by depleting the enemy of his 
energy. Energy is lost by being hit, or by 
attempting an attack that is blocked by the enemy. 
To win, a combination of attacking and parrying 
moves is necessary, of which several are available 
depending on the character's stance (standing or 
crouched) and the direction the joystick is 
pushed. 
 
Two players can engage in a duel in two-player 
mode.

Hijack (c) 1986 Electric Dreams Software|Paradise 
Software / Electric Dreams Software 
 
You are the head of the US Government’s Hijack 
Division, and you are called into action when a 
group of terrorists hijack a vehicle. You have 
three potential ways to foil them – get enough 
money to bribe them, use political influence to 
over-rule them, or bring in military force. To 
achieve any of these tasks, you will need to work 
with the President, FBI and CIA agents, Military 
and Political Advisers, and other staff including 
the Secretary to keep you in contact with them. 
You have a time limit, which the President can 
attempt to extend with the hijackers if you 
request this. 
 
You control your characters left-right movement 
through the buildings directly, including entering 
lifts to switch rooms, but moving the controller 
up or down moves a cursor along rows of icons at 
the top and bottom of the screen. The screen also 
has graphs to indicate your current political, 
military and financial situations. 
 
Most important of these are the chances to 
interact with other staff members, provided they 
are in the room. There are at least two requests 
you can make to each of them – The President can 
be asked for more support, an FBI Agent can 
question staff to ensure that there is no inside 
information. CIA Agents can give information about 
the hijackers, with 3 levels of detail, the more 
advanced ones taking longer. Press releases must 
be issued to ensure good publicity (and thus keep 
the President on your side) and funds raised to 
help with a financial solution. 
 
Your final target is to go to the scene of the 
hijack and negotiate with the terrorists. You can 
bring your key advisers with you, to increase the 
chance of a correct outcome.

As a child, you spent most of your summers with 
your Aunt Hildegarde and Uncle Buddy. What 
memories! Uncle Buddy was a Hollywood big-shot, 
Aunt Hildegarde his loving (and very rich) wife. 
They had no children of their own, but you and 
your cousins loved their house, their parties, the 
Hollywood memorabilia, and them. Sure, Buddy and 
Hildy were a bit eccentric -- but that added to 
their charm. 
 
Aunt Hildegarde kept the house when Uncle Buddy 
passed away. And now that she's suddenly died, you 
remember her unusual will. You will inherit the 
entire estate -- probably worth millions if you 
can spend just one night in the house and on the 
grounds, find a treasure or two. But if you can't 
then you inherit nothing. 
 
And so Hollywood Hijinx begins with you being 
dropped off in front of a dark house, not to far 
from Hollywood ...

Hotrod (c) 1990 SEGA Corporation / Activision, 
Inc. 
 
Hot Rod is a top-view racing game influenced by 
Super Sprint, in which three miniature cars race 
to complete a race as quickly as possible, by 
rotating, accelerating and braking at the right 
moments. You start with limited fuel, but more can 
be collected as you cover the track. Hitting 
hazards can cause your car to explode, thus 
costing time as it is replaced. 
 
Unusually the racetracks are linear rather than 
lap-based, so each round involves covering a 
section of track once. After each race, you can 
purchase upgrades at the shop, depending on how 
much money you earned in the previous race. 
 
Only part of the circuit is shown at a time, and 
this scrolls following the leader. If you fail to 
keep up with this, your car is moved forward on 
the track, with a penalty fuel deduction. This is 
slightly similar to the system later used in 
head-to-head games of Micro Machines, and is 
especially punishing while you are on roads 
travelling horizontally and the leading CPU car is 
travelling vertically, as it makes the margin for 
error much smaller.

Hotshot (c) 1988 Maxwell Technology Ltd. / Prism 
Leisure Corporation Plc 
 
A simple two-player game released to much 
marketing fanfare, Hotshot places you and another 
player (either another person or an AI robot) in 
an arena split down the middle into two save for a 
hole about half the screen's height for the ball 
to travel through, with a series of bricks on each 
side to destroy. 
 
The aim of the game is to destroy your own bricks 
before your opponent can destroy his. This is 
achieved by catching the small by pointing your 
suction device at it and holding fire, and then 
releasing in the needed by letting go of the 
button. This is easier said than done, as the ball 
neither moves in a straight line or according to 
the natural rules of.gravity. 
 
Should either player be hit with the ball and not 
catch it properly, they will be knocked down and 
possession of the ball is passed to the other 
player.

The house has several rooms, each of which are 
filled with objects which are of use, as well as 
unlimited supplies of food, alcohol and coffee, 
which control how drunk you are at a time – some 
awful actions force you to be sober, others force 
you to be drunk. The game also displays whether 
you need the toilet (or, more accurately, any part 
of the house that would cause offence), whether 
you need to fart, and how strong-smelling these 
are. 
 
The rooms can all be viewed from multiple angles, 
and 2 can be viewed at a time through a 
split-screen view. 
 
To win, you need to prove to all 16 party guest 
that you are a complete bastard.

How to be a Hero (c) 1987 Xcel / Mastertronic Ltd. 
 
This Gauntlet-inspired arcade adventure has three 
separate challenges, each of which can be loaded 
from the main screen. All are viewed from above, 
and involve shooting enemies (contact with whom 
drains your energy). Your health is represented by 
gradually-withering pineapples, which are 
recharged by eating food. 
 
The first is set in Egypt - you are locked inside 
a treasure-packed temple, and must escape through 
seven locked doors, each of which has its own key. 
The second sees you on a doomed spaceship, needing 
to collect security passes and circuit board 
pieces. The third is in a city full of mutants - 
escape passages are locked and a crucial document 
is in 24 pieces. 
 
The minimum target of escaping involves collecting 
keys - note that each barrier has only one way of 
being opened. To be a true hero, you must collect 
the sets of 24 treasure pieces/circuit board 
pieces/torn document pieces within the levels.

Everything began after the opening of the last 
film of our attractive protagonist. When 
finalizing the projection, everybody was pending 
of the exit of Humphrey and when this one 
appeared, well, that seemed uncontrollable. 
 
All fans jumped on his back and began to embrace, 
to kiss, to clear the clothes to him... just a 
little bit and had been the first film actor  
attacked in public. 
 
Humphrey finished in hospital with all kind of 
contusions and a nervous crisis that him left 
postrated in the bed during several months. When 
he recovered, he changed of house with the 
intention to obtain some privacy and to avoid that 
they took place more incidents like the one than 
took to the hospital. 
 
But it seems that our friend was nothing lucky. 
The decorator had painted all the rooms with 
different colors that Humphrey had chosen and that 
caused certain alteration in his deranged nervous 
system.

Hunchback (c) 1984 Century Electronics / 
Amsoft|Ocean Software Ltd. 
 
Victor Hugo never could have expected that his 
creation Quasimodo, the Hunchback of Notre Dame, 
would run such an obstacle course as is dished up 
in this game, dodging fireballs and arrows while 
leaping over pits and pikemen, sometimes with the 
help of a swinging bell-pull rope, in hopes of 
rescuing his beloved Esmeralda from the top tower 
-- all while being slow-but-steady chased across 
the castle parapets by an invincible knight in 
full armour.  Once you get the hang of any 
individual obstacle, the game starts throwing them 
at you in tandem, until toward the end you're 
tracking the swing of the rope, the thrust of the 
lance, the approach of the arrow and the advance 
of the knight all simultaneously!  Succeed, 
against all odds, and you get to do it again, but 
faster!  Even an able-bodied protagonist would 
have a hard time juggling all these threats, but I 
have a feeling a dedicated player with patience 
and good timing can overcome them.  Let's call it 
a hunch.

Hunchback II - Quasimodo's Revenge (c) 1985 Ocean 
Software Ltd. / Ocean Software Ltd. 
 
The archetype of the Hunchback of Notre Dame 
really isn't terribly nuanced: he jumps around 
towers, ringing bells, rescuing Esmeralda and 
being generally physically unattractive.  Here he 
does all of these things, in a more 
platform-oriented take than the original, 
clambering up dangling ropes as they rise and 
fall, avoiding environmental threats such as rabid 
bats, thrown hatchets and enormous grinding 
clockwork gears all in the pursuit of small bells 
strewn across each screen's platforms.  Gathering 
all the bells permits you to advance higher up the 
tower, at the top of which the damsel in distress 
awaits your homely visage.

Hunchback - The Adventure (c) 1986 Ocean Software 
Ltd. / Ocean Software Ltd. 
 
As they went on to demonstrate with Nightbreed, 
Ocean wasn't afraid to try a few different 
approaches to licensed material once they'd gotten 
their mitts on it, which is how you explain 
following up not one but two run-and-jump platform 
games with a text adventure game -- the change in 
approach a breath of fresh air and, perhaps, a 
response to critics suggesting that rehashing the 
same old thing is getting tired and stale. 
 
Many arcade games of the period would have a hard 
time with the transition, lacking enough of a 
skeleton of plot to flesh out with characters and 
events, but the Hunchback franchise has always 
enjoyed descent from one of the greatest works of 
French fiction (not incidentally long since in the 
public domain, hence ripe for free squeezing), 
Victor Hugo's Notre-Dame de Paris... even if it 
hadn't made terribly extensive use of its heritage 
up to this title. 
 
You are still Quasimodo, deformed ward of the 
Church, and you still quest for the favour and 
well-being of gypsy Esperalda, but for once you 
don't do so by jumping over pits and ducking under 
arrows (and, uh, participating in organised 
sporting events)!  Instead, you navigate sites in, 
around and under Paris, including the Cathedral of 
Notre Dame, collecting inventory items to use to 
solve puzzles and overcome minions of the Bishop 
and Cardinal -- foes who no longer cause you to 
lose a life at the merest contact. 
 
The narrative does sustain a bit of garbling along 
the way in the transition from high literature to 
action arcade game and back to crypto-literary 
interactive fiction, but they take what they've 
learned about design along the way and present 
things clearly, possessions and companions 
continually visually indicated above a baroque 
text input/output field.  The interface is as 
intuitive as those of the prior games in the 
franchise, despite the enormous gulf between their 
respective styles of gameplay.  Now you can give 
your twitchy fingers a rest and let your brain 
take over for a while.

consequence the confinement of Jorund in the 
kingdom of Lukx, from where nobody has ever

Because of this deceit the Viking king has

the Gods keep jealous, as well as some of the 
nymphs more beautiful than ever a human eye has 
contemplated. 
 
Before such attractiveness, Jorund fell for the 
deceit of Loki and profaned the garden. The wrath 
of the Gods fell on him and their punishment did 
not take long: they would border to him to 
perpetuity to the kingdom of Lukx, where their 
inhabitants would give good account of the bones 
of our protagonist. 
 
But Hundra was not resigned to that her father 
died in that exile, and therefore, could not reach 
Valhalla, paradise of the viking warriors. 
 
Decided to change the fate of her father, she went 
to the Viking Mount Olympus where she convinced 
the Gods that her father had been deceived. They 
admitted their mistake, and saw that the 
punishment had been excessive

Hydro Fool (c) 1987 Carter Follis Software

After his improbable success in Sweevo's World, 
the world's least capable robot is back, and must 
go to the heavily-polluted Deathbowl and clean it 
up. The Deathbowl's four plugs must be removed, in 
order, so as to drain the poisonous water and 
allow it to be refilled. 
 
The specific objects required to clear each plug 
must be obtained, in many cases by shooting the 
enemies who hold them - a task made harder by the 
fact that contact with them is fatal, you start 
without weaponry, and no weapon has unlimited 
ammunition. Whirlpools and bubbles must be used to 
reach the various areas of the Deathbowl. Contact 
with water causes Sweevo to start rusting, 
although oil can be picked up to limit the effect. 
The game is viewed isometrically, and features 
over 200 screens of action and puzzles (more in 
128K mode).

Hyperbowl (c) 1987 Binary Design, Ltd. / 
Mastertronic Ltd. 
 
Hyperbowl is a one-on-one futuristic sport viewed 
from above, with a small amount of the rectangular 
pitch visible at a time.  Each player controls one 
of the 10 available spaceships, each with their 
own subtle strengths and weaknesses in terms of 
speed, inertia and fire direction. A scanner shows 
the positions of both ships and the ball, so that 
things don't become disorientating. 
 
The aim is to guide the ball either into a 'goal' 
in the middle of each end (scoring 2 points) or 
onto the goal-line elsewhere (scoring one point). 
The ball can be steered either by hitting it with 
the ship or by shooting at it with your craft's 
beam (which does not injure or impede the 
opposition craft in any way). In either case the 
ball moves in a semi-random direction similar to 
the one you directed it in, but can rebound off 
the plus-shaped divots in the wall unexpectedly. 
 
The game lasts for 5 minutes, or until a player 
reaches the winning score of 9. Each of the three 
skills levels is a 5-tier tournament of increasing 
difficulty.

Six tough events await in this joystick-waggling 
action game. The full sequence of events is - 
swimming, skeet shooting, gymnastics, archery, 
triple jumping and weightlifting. You must 
complete each event in order to be allowed onto 
the next one. 
 
Swimming involves moving left and right as fast as 
possible, while pressing fire when a breath is 
required. Skeet shooting and archery both come 
down to timing - though elevation and wind factors 
affect the latter. Gymnastics involves timing a 
succession of presses to ensure that the jump is 
long and the landing graceful. The triple jump 
involves one press for each part of the jump, 
whereas the weightlifting involves merely brute 
strength.

Impossaball puts you in control of a ball, and

standard, but can be directed to move, or bounce 
higher to gain momentum. Your task is to land on 
every cylinder in the level, so as to squash them 
down to ground level. Lots of spikes protrude in 
the levels, which must be avoided. Magic rings are 
both friend and foe - the first contact increases 
your remaining time, but a further contact loses a 
life. Other obstacles cause the ball to rebound, 
which could be good or bad depending on the 
situation.

Monty Mole has been living in luxury since his 
previous adventures, but he has now been beamed up 
by an alien race who want him to do a job for 
them. Monty must trek through five worlds to 
retrieve the sacred scrolls of the race's 
Guardians. 
 
As with Core's previous hit Rick Dangerous 2 there 
is versatility in the exact structure of the game. 
The first four consist of the Orient, a Klondike 
mine, an Ice world and an Amazon forest - once 
these are completed the final world is open to 
you. 
 
The platform-based gameplay is similar to Monty's 
earlier games, with primarily horizontal 
progresses as well as ropes and ladders to 
navigate. Monty has developed a useful flying 
kick, and has been given a smart bomb, with the 
potential to collect extra bombs and guns. 
Hazards, enemies and level designs are themed 
around each level, and range from cable cars and 
falling snowballs to Ninjas and Monkeys.

Incredible Shrinking Sphere (c) 1989 Foursfield / 
Electric Dreams Software 
 
The Incredible Shrinking Sphere of the title comes 
under your control in this isometric maze game 
which has similarities to Marble Madness and 
Spindizzy. The ball needs to be guided from the 
start of a level to the end, through 4 linked 
sections. 
 
Various functioning squares must be used to your 
advantage. Uniquely these include changes to the 
ball's size, as well as it's physics. Revolving 
squares randomly fire the ball off in another 
direction, and ramps shoot you in the current 
direction at high speed. Weapons can be collected, 
as can shields - both of which are required to 
avoid some of the hazards on show. Black holes are 
always fatal however.

Indiana Jones and the Fate of Atlantis (c) 1992 
Attention to Detail Limited / LucasArts|U.S. Gold 
Ltd. 
 
Being an action title, the game starts off where 
Indy is about to have an excuse to use his trusty 
whip: in Monte Carlo, after he recruited 
headstrong former student Sophie to his aid and 
determined the location of ancient discs needed to 
open the door to the lost city of Atlantis. Most 
action takes place in isometric view, although 
there are some variations along the way to keep up 
interest. There are even some adventure-game 
elements, such as Indy's inventory which you can 
fill with various objects to use (i.e. money to 
buy things). They are mostly easy though, and are 
there only to relieve the tension from 
knuckle-blistering action.

Indiana Jones and the Last Crusade (c) 1989 
Tiertex Ltd. / U.S. Gold Ltd. 
 
As in the movie (and the more famous graphic 
adventure), your task is to find the Holy Grail. 
Before this can be done you must find the Cross of 
Coronado, a shield and a diary. 
 
This makes for a four-level arcade adventure 
combining climbs, exploration (with several routes 
through each level, and some traps) and puzzles. 
Indy is armed with his trusty whip to fight off 
foes, but can also get involved in hand-to-hand 
combat. The first level takes place in caves 
underneath Colorado, before you reach a moving 
circus train strewn with traps, a Zeppelin which 
is full of guards and ladders, and then Castle 
Grunwald in Austria.

Atari Games Corporation / U.S. Gold Ltd. 
 
The computer versions of Indiana Jones and the 
Temple of Doom are conversions of the Atari arcade 
game based on the second movie in the series. As 
Indy you must complete several cycles of the 
following 3 types of levels:Mine level: Whip your 
way through a mine in order to free children that 
are held captive. Use your whip to swing across 
chasms, climb ladders, ride along conveyor belts 
and defend yourself against attacks from Thuggee 
guards, bats, snakes and the fireball-throwing 
Mola ram. Escape with the mine cart after you've 
freed all children. 
2. Mine cart level: Pick the right route 
   through a network of tracks while riding in a 
   mine cart. Avoid potholes, broken tracks & 
   guards in carts and safely reach the end of the 
   track. 
3. Temple level: Make your way to the altar and 
   grab the Sankara stone while Mola Ram, bats and 
   Thuggee guards attack you. Watch out for that 
   lava. 
With every cycle the mine & mine cart levels 
become more complex, the layout of the temple 
levels is always the same. After several cycles 
there's a showdown with Mola Ram on the rope 
bridge.

Ingrid is Ingrid Bottomlow, the 
intellectual-but-clumsy gnome we met in Gnome 
Ranger. Her beloved home village Little Moaning is 
earmarked for a yuppie-friendly transformation by 
Jasper Quickbuck of Ridley's Manor. 
 
Ingrid has three cunning plans to stop him - 
producing a petition with everybody's signature, 
finding a more orthodox prevention method, and 
finally infiltrating Ridley's Manor itself by 
pretending to be a maid, and then finding proof 
that he's a dodgy geezer who should be locked up. 
These three quests can be played in any order, 
although they logically follow on from each other. 
She is accompanied by Flopsy the dog in the first 
2 parts, and her cousin Daisy in the third. 
 
Ingrid's Back uses the same game system as the 
original, and other contemporary Level 9 titles 
such as Knight Orc . Giving instructions to other 
characters (including Flopsy) and jumping around 
the map using GO TO and FOLLOW commands. A living 
and breathing world of people travelling, trading 
and relaxing underpins it all, and plays a part in 
most puzzles.

has donated her castle, but alas, you must prove 
your identity. Your family book is somewhere in 
this castle and "false nephews" are popping up 
everywhere. What a chaos! 
 
As its predecessor, the game is played in 
first-person view with point-and-click interface. 
The player moves a cursor in the screen with the 
ARROW KEYS, and interacts with objects by pressing 
the ACTION key. Inventory is now limited to 4 
items and moved to the bottom of the screen. The 
game now consists of single load, but to make it 
more difficult a percentage of your hungriness is 
introduced to the game. It is equal to 99% at the 
beginning and is decreasing with time flow. You 
should keep an eye on it and fill it, eating food 
found in the castle. 
 
During the game, you, Mr. Peter Stone, will 
interact with different persons and collect/use 
different items. Some of your actions may be 
lethal for the others, but you should also keep 
your alive and get your Inheritance finally.

airplane ticket he must travel to meet the notary 
and arrange the details of the inheritance. 
 
The Inheritance: Panic in Las Vegas is a French

cursor in the screen with the ARROW KEYS, and

A handbag in the right side serves as the 
inventory and can be minimized to an icon at the 
bottom. The game is divided in three loads. At the 
end of each load, the player receives a password 
for the next one: 
 
?The first load is entitled "In the building", 
where the player must leave his apartment and go 
to the airport. The airplane leaves at 11:20, and 
this game section starts at 11:10. Besides this 
time limit, progress is further hindered by the 
other tenants that appear at each floor. They 
demand the return of borrowed goods. The player 
can search other apartments, steal money and 
threaten the other residents with weapons (this 
last option can lead to an instantaneous death). 
 
?"At the airport" is the second load, where the 
player must embark on the airplane to Las Vegas. 
There is terrorists and other annoyances to be 
dealt with. 
 
?The final load is called "In Las Vegas", where 
the player must find the notary, while raising 
some necessary money (a testament clause says that 
in order to inherit the money Peter has to raise 1 
million dollars by playing games at the casinos).

Seven-a-side rugby union is brought to life in

side, although kicks to the posts are played from 
a behind-the-posts perspective. Scrums and 
line-outs are incorporated for as realistic a game 
as possible given the player restriction. A 
tournament can be played with up to 8 players, 
with as many computer teams as required to fill 
the gaps. 
 
In the ST version the tactical side of the game is 
very complex - seventeen different formations are 
on offer. Other gameplay variables can be set - 
player stamina (lower values forcing you to play a 
more conservative game), how long a player takes 
to recover from a tackle, and the standard 
strengths of passes and kicks, pus some very 
complicated mathematical coefficients. The ability 
to rename teams, change kits and alter the match 
lengths seem banal by comparison.

flying a plane over a limited area, and shooting 
his planes so that they fall and inflict damage on 
the target item, which is large at the bottom of 
the screen. Multiple shots on a particular spot 
will ultimately cause a water-spout

Enter the world of off-road racing as 4 vehicles 
will face each other, on a series of tracks which 
are based around flipped and reversed versions of 
a core selection. Fame, glory and bikini clad 
women await your victories and the taste of dirt 
awaits if you fail. Let a computer car beat you 
and you lose one of your 3 credits. 
 
Successful races bring more money, which can be 
used to soup up their machine. Boosts to top 
speed, grip and acceleration can be purchased, and 
your nitro boost must be kept topped up. If you 
are desperate for upgrades, you can buy into your 
spare credits 
 
Only your off-road driving abilities will be 
enough to pull you to first place in these races. 
Play alone or with up to 3 other players 
(depending on the version)  in this conversion of 
a classic arcade game.

Iznogoud (c) 1987 Infogrames Multimedia SA / 
Infogrames Multimedia SA 
 
This game from 1987 is based on the adventures of 
the French comic book character Iznogoud.   You 
are in the role of the Grand Vizier Iznogoud, 
whose only thought is to depose the Caliph of 
magical Baghdad and become "Caliph instead of the 
Caliph!"  To accomplish this aim, you must wander 
around and interact with characters around you, 
acquiring objects along the way that may or may 
not be useful, and figure out how all this will 
help you achieve your goal. 
 
During the game, you have 4 different methods of 
interacting with other characters: you can give 
objects to them, you can threaten them, you can 
flatter them, and you can throw a tantrum.  
Depending on the character, these actions will 
elicit different responses--or none altogether.  
You will need objects for various things, and 
objects are all acquired from other characters.  
Some characters are helpful, others are not.  But 
the right combination of your actions will help 
you to become Caliph instead of the Caliph, while 
the wrong ones will often land you in a cell 
beneath the palace.  Just be careful not to lose 
your own head in the process!

Jabato, El (c) 1989 Aventuras AD / Aventuras AD 
 
Jabato is an adventure composed of six parts, each 
one with its own independent argument, but subtly 
related to the main plot. In each geographic area 
you will have different problems, interlaced 
within a series of "custom pictures" which gather 
part of Europe and North  Africa as they were in 
the first century BC. It was the time of the Roman 
Empire splendor, their legions extend and dominate 
the known world, but in each one of their 
provinces the inhabitants breathe freedom and make 
their own rules, codes and rituals. In Hispania, 
Jabato became a legendary figure, prototype of the 
implacable hero in the fight against the evil but 
with a great heart. In this history you will 
assume the role of this fabulous personage. 
 
But it won't be easy: instead of living one of his 
moments of greatness, you will incarnate a 
defeated Jabato, without friends, prisoner in a 
dirty Roman jail with the bitter feeling that his 
beloved Claudia is captive in a distant land. Your 
final mission will be to avoid that her could be 
sacrificed by the fanatical sect of the Egyptian 
sub-world. For it, on the first part, you must 
liberate yourself from the Roman yoke and search 
for company. Multiple adventures are awaiting you 
soon in the Galia and Hispania. The second part 
begins in Cesarea, in which you must enter in the 
heart of Africa and obtain the keys that could 
allow you to survive in the lands of the mythical 
tombs, sacred Pharaohs and great mysteries. If you 
survive, you will fight the final battle against 
the terrible forces of the dark wisdom.

perhaps something smaller and lighter may make it 
in where larger forces would fail. A small jeep,

suitable enough to aid in rescue. But of course,

pick up objects and drop those at places where 
they cause the most trouble to grown-ups. 
 
The various objects can be found all over town and 
at Jack's home. 
The game starts at Jack's home but Jack can walk 
out the door and go into town to, for example, 
blow up the police station, kill all flowers or 
free prisoners. Try to get a credit card and do 
some serious shopping! 
 
The first thing you should look for is you 
peashooter and fire peas at various objects or 
persons. Toot your horn to frustrate grown-ups or 
animals. 
 
The naughtier your the higher your naughtyometer 
goes up! 
The game comes to an end as the naughtyometer 
reaches 100%. 
Cause as much trouble as you can... but don't get 
spanked for it by grown-ups!

Naughty toddler Jack finds himself in Africa, with 
the aim of progressing through 192 screens of 
platform action. He starts with nine lives but no 
weapons, although a supply of coconuts to lob is

The jungle is full of snakes, rhinos, birds and 
all manner of other creatures, all of which must 
be avoided or killed - remember that their attack 
paths are pre-programmed, and the trajectory of 
your coconuts is quite limited. Travelling through 
the levels involves, amongst other things, 
ladders, mine carts, trees, ropes and logs. 
 
As well as simply completing the game and amassing 
as many points as possible, you can aim to be as 
naughty as possible, which is gauged by a 
'Naughty-O-Meter' next to the score, with numerous 
objects available for that purpose (one can be 
carried at a time, alongside one weapon).

toggling the right switches. There are also 
timing-based hazards such as arrows emerging from 
walls and lazer beams - contact with any of these 
costs one of your five lives. You also lose a life 
if you run out of energy. Some levels vary the 
format by requiring you to simply collect every 
note on a single screen, which has regeneration

At the beginning of the game you are George 
Jetson, labourer of the Spacely Space Sprockets 
company in 2062. Your boss Mr. Spacely wants you 
to work, but you want to collect money and have a 
fun. So after the boss ordinary order you can 
explore the company as usually, collect money 
bills and useful items, avoiding dangerous robotic 
mechanisms and Mr. Spacely himself. 
 
On further levels, other Jetsons family members 
must do the same things, but at their own 
locations. Level 2 involves taking Jane out of her 
booby-trapped home, level 3 sees Judy trying to 
get a kiss form pop heartthrob Jet Screamer, and 
finally Elroy is locked in at school and has to 
escape. 
 
You have to activate the items hidden behind the 
hatches with buttons. These allow you to progress 
on level, for example, fix an elevator with 
wrench. Time presses and you have to complete your 
mission quickly.

Jimmy's Soccer Manager (c) 1992 
 
This football management game is vaguely linked to 
Jimmy Greaves, a successful former footballer who 
in the early 90s co-hosted (with former Liverpool 
player Ian St. John) the vaguely satirical 
football magazine programme “Saint and Greavsie”. 
The player manages Kettering Town of Division 5 
(the same as the real-life Conference) and must 
lead them to league and cup glory, climbing 
through the divisions. 
 
The player begins with a squad of 13 players, and 
must select 11 of these to form the team 
(formations are not considered). Players can be 
transfer listed, which allows CPU teams to bid on 
them, although bids for any player can be received

Jim Power in "Mutant Planet" (c) 1992 Digital 
Concept|Loriciel SA / Loriciel SA 
 
Jim Power was a hero who one day while travelling 
through the forest, encountered a dimensional rift 
into a strange new world. Luckily Jim always 
travels armed and now he'll need to fight his way 
past several monsters into a monster stronghold to 
find his way back home. 
 
Jim Power is a side-scrolling platform game, a 
side-scrolling shooter and a top-view shooter game 
depending on the level. Jim Power for the most 
part can jump and has an upgradable gun weapon. He 
must find fight enemies, bosses and obtain various 
keys to progress through the levels. Jim also has 
a "Smart Bomb" power attack which can clear the 
screen of enemies. In shooter levels, Jim's 
spaceship only has the ability to shoot and move 
around the screen avoiding obstacles.

Jinxter (c) 1988 Magnetic Scrolls / Rainbird

Aquatania has recently become the land of 
misfortunes, due to a group of plotting witches. 
The task of finding five charms and a magic 
bracelet to put things right falls on you. 
 
And you need a change of luck, because events in 
this game often emphasise the slings and arrows of 
outrageous fortune. You get hit by a car, fall a 
great height, sprayed with cheese sandwich and 
more! Being the guinea pig in this strange world 
will drive you insane - if this jinxed land 
doesn't do it first. 
 
Jinxter is an interactive fiction with graphics 
title that takes a realistic world of people and 
situations, and then plays with the boundaries to 
create a strange and puzzling world. Characters 
are all getting on with their own tasks, and 
getting them to help you is usually a case of 
making sure something's in it for them. 
 
Dialogue aims to add a comic touch to proceedings. 
Puzzles can often be solved in multiple ways, but 
the most obvious way is not always the correct 
one. Due to the presence of a Guardian, you can't 
actually die.

Tough guy Joe Blade must rescue six respected 
leaders from the madcap Crax Bloodfinger, who has 
kidnapped them in different areas of his base. 
Along the way he will find six bombs which must be 
activated, leaving him with only 20 minutes to 
rescue everyone. 
 
Joe Blade is viewed side-on and uses flick-screen 
progression. The bombs are deactivated by 
arranging letters into alphabetical order, but the 
bulk of the gameplay involves shooting and maze 
navigation. The screens are linked in various 
ways, and contain a number of keys which must be 
used correctly.

Joe Blade 2 (c) 1988 Players Software / Players 
Software 
 
As Players Software correctly predicted, London in 
1995 is an unfriendly unsafe city ran by thugs. 
Innocent civilians who leave the house will almost 
certainly face violence. An acclaimed hero since 
his successes in the original, Joe Blade is the 
man to put things right - if he can kill 100 thugs 
and rescue 20 civilians within ten minutes, the 
thugs will retreat and the city will be saved. 
 
As Joe, you must move through the streets and kill 
these thugs, by kicking them in the head (they 
have body armour). As in the first game, the 
streets are flick-screen and have many doorways 
linking them. Rescuing civilians involves touching 
them before completing a sub-game within a minute. 
 
There are four subgame variants of increasing 
difficulty, all based around a 1-2-3-4 sequence of 
numbers. The first involves simply stopping the 
cursor as each one appears in order - pressing the 
wrong one sends you back to having to find a 1. In 
the second, the numbers are on screen in random 
order, a cursor cycling through them - press fire 
to swap the two numbers currently highlighted. In 
the third, you are presented with two jumbled sets 
and must put one of them in order, by swapping 
numbers across the two sets. In the fourth, you 
must form the sequence by swapping an 
ever-changing number into the right place, by 
pressing fire at the right moment.

four 15-minute (accelerated real-time) quarters.  
Graphics are simple: one team has blue uniforms, 
the other team red ones.  The human player gets 
control of the quarterback on offense and the 
middle linebacker on defense.  The play 
perspective is top-down and vertical-scrolling.  
Choose from 9 offensive--mostly passing--plays and

Jump (c) 1992 Zigurat / Zigurat 
 
This arcade game is a cross between Breakout and 
Space Invaders. Player controls an 
electromechanical robot, who walks along the top 
of a wall consisting of bricks and jumps on it. A 
line of bugs is coming to him from the bottom of 
the screen in vertical direction, while the bomb 
is flying in horizontal direction in the center. 
Bugs may be killed by jumping on the wall, which 
results in a brick falling from its bottom. The 
number of jumps is equal to the bottom brick's 
distance from the robot. Flying bomb may eliminate 
the brick until it reaches the bug, but if the bug 
is killed, its bad or good soul will fly to the 
top, where robot may collect it and make influence 
on his mood. After the bug is eliminated, another 
one will start to crawl from the bottom. There is 
a snail moving in horizontal direction at the very 
bottom of the screen, which is mostly covered by 
the bugs crawling to the top, and it may be hit by 
brick in case of success also. 
 
The player is transferred to another level after 
necessary quantity of the bugs is killed. But 
beware! Robot's energy is exhausted, when bug is 
crawling upon him, and the robot becomes 
non-functional if the bugs reached the very top of 
the screen or if the robot falls off the wall.

shooting and two putting you on horseback. 
 
The first level involves shooting at birds, with a 
minimum of 3 required to progress. You must aim in 
front of the birds, so as to allow for the 
distance they will cover as the bullet travels. In 
the third level you are now shooting at bad guys, 
who emerge from locations (bank, saloon, store) on 
an accurate Wild West layout. 
 
The second level sees you attempting to jump over 
rocks and cacti, whereas level 4 involves jumping 
across a speeding train in order to wrestle

In the 24th century, Earth is pounded by solar

is recolonized by a dangerous race known as Kat 
Men. When the solar explosions died, the humans 
decide to return to Earth.  When the Kat Men 
refuse to leave, a war droid known as MT-ED, or 
Multi Terrain Exploration Droid, is sent down to 
deal with the Kat Men. Accompanying him is 
Hercules 1, a maintenance and combat droid. When 
the two droids are beamed down, things take a turn 
for the worse. Hercules is kidnapped and  taken 
far away to the Kat Men's Nerve Center. It is 
MT-ED's task to get rid of the Kat Men and rescue 
Hercules. 
 
To do this, MT-ED has to explore fourteen 
environments and deal with deadly creatures that 
are within each environment, with each type of 
creature requiring a certain type of weapon to be 
defeated. These weapons - including lasers, water 
bombs, grenades, and rockets - can be picked up 
along the way, and MT-ED can switch between them 
with ease. If MT-ED comes into contact with any of 
the creatures, he is kicked into the air and gets 
stunned for a few seconds. If this happens, he 
loses one of his lives. Not all creatures are 
deadly

Kenny Dalglish Soccer Manager (c) 1989 Cognito /

By 1989 Kenny Dalglish scarcely played for 
Liverpool, and was almost entirely concentrating 
on his role as manager, so a football management 
game with no arcade action featuring his license 
made sense. The game is purely icon- and 
menu-driven, perhaps the first step in dragging 
the genre into the 90s. Whichever team you took 
charge of start from the 4th division. Match 
highlights can be selected - these are viewed from 
the side and show goals and near-misses, although 
they can be turned off. 
 
You start with squads of over 20 players from 
which to choose your team of 11, each given a 
straightforward ability rating. Formations can be 
selected by placing each player in a precise 
position alongside the formation of the opposition 
team, using a fairly advanced system for the time. 
Via a separate menu you can consult with the 
chairman (to see if he's happy with your efforts), 
the physio (to check for injuries), the scout (who 
comes up with players you might like to purchase) 
and so on.

Kenny Dalglish Soccer Match (c) 1990 Impressions /

Kenny Dalglish was a hugely successful player for 
Celtic, Liverpool and Scotland, before becoming 
the first person to win the English league 
championship while both playing and managing (for 
Liverpool in 1985, also winning the FA Cup that 
year). This was his second licensed game, and is a 
side-scrolling action game featuring single 
matches played between a team in red and a team in 
blue, each of which can be any of 9 skill levels. 
Matches can be varied between 10 and 90 minutes. 
The ball is loosely controlled in a manner similar 
to the Kick off series, although it isn’t possible 
to pass the ball a short distance, so an element 
of hitting and hoping comes into play, especially 
as the ball can’t be curved far. The ball bounces 
quite heavily, and is very difficult to shoot on 
target from closer than 30 yards or so.

Kick Off was the first football game of its kind, 
having a top down view and unlike other football 
games of that time the ball was not glued to the 
feet of the players. Playing Kick Off requires 
skills in boll control. There is an option to 
learn these skills without being harassed by the 
opposition. The set pieces like corner kicks, 
passing, sliding tackles and dribbling can be 
practiced to perfection. Each player on the pitch 
has a unique combination of 4 attributes, namely 
Pace, Stamina, Accuracy and Aggression. As you 
progress you will need to adapt to to different 
types of players. You can play in a league 
consisting of 8 teams. The teams in the league are 
on the whole evenly matched but have different 
styles of play with players attribute to match 
that style. There is 12 different referees in the 
game.

The original Kick Off was expanded on in many ways

tournament modes (although the players on the

(including an implementation of plastic pitches, 
whose uneven bounce cause controversy when several 
British clubs tried them in the 1980s). 
 
Viewed top-down, the controls involve trapping the 
ball under your foot, giving you time to prepare 
passes. Running with the ball is tricky at first, 
as it doesn't stick to your foot the way it did in 
contemporary football games. Complex moves such as 
overhead kicks, back-heels and long-range 
through-ball passes can be completed with 
practice.

Killed Until Dead (c) 1987 Artech / U.S. Gold Ltd. 
 
Killed Until Dead is a sophisticated mystery game 
with a leaning towards humor. The player has to 
solve every aspect of a murder case before it 
happens. The five biggest mystery writers in the 
world have gathered together at a hotel and one of 
them will be offing another unless Hercule Holmes 
can crack the case. 
 
Gameplay is a cross between the board-game Clue 
and the paper-based logic puzzles in which the 
player must eliminate clues in sequence. To solve 
the forthcoming murder, you will have to search 
the suspects' rooms and confront them with the 
evidence and set the hotel's security cameras to 
record secret meetings. 
 
By questioning the suspects as to what they know 
about certain people, rooms and objects, they may 
reveal combinations they know will not be involved 
in the murder - perhaps if it involves the gun, 
the killer will not be Lord Peter Flimsey, for 
example.  However, there's a catch. If he accuses 
the wrong suspect, he might be the one who's 
Killed Until Dead - they don't take kindly to 
false accusation.

Killer Ball (c) 1991 Microïds / Microïds 
 
In the dark future the new brutal sports game will 
be invented - Killerball - a blend of American 
Football, Roller-Skating, and Pinball. The three 
leagues (Elite, Major and Minor) will differ by 
the level of brutality. The action takes place in 
a circular rink. Each team of five players should 
put the iron ball in the small hole of the 
opposite team to make a score, and do not allow 
the players of another team to make the same. Each 
team player has health indicator, which will 
decrease during the game, because the only way to 
take the ball is to knock down the opponent in any 
brutal way. Each match during the season has time 
limit, but it may be finished also if all the 
players of any team will be unconscious and at 
least one ball will be put in the hole. 
 
The game has a training mode, where you may play a 
single match with a computer or another human 
player, and tournament mode, where eight teams 
controlled either by computer or human players 
will fight for the victory. Tournament progress 
may be saved and restored.

Killer Gorilla (c) 1984 
 
Killer Gorilla is a four stage platform game set 
on a building construction site. Stages consist of 
girders, ladders, conveyor belts and elevators. 
The object of stages one, two and three is to 
reach the top of the screen where your girlfriend 
is guarded by the eponymous Killer Gorilla. On 
stage four the objective is to remove the rivets 
from the girders, causing the top of the building 
to collapse and the gorilla to fall. On all 
stages, items belonging to your girlfriend can be 
collected for extra points. When stage four is 
completed, play loops back to stage one. Killer 
Gorilla is a clone of Nintendo's Donkey Kong 
arcade game. 
 
On stage one, the gorilla rolls barrels down the 
screen. These can be avoided, jumped over, or 
smashed with a hammer that can be collected and 
carried for a short time. If a barrel reaches the 
flaming barrel at the bottom of the screen, it 
will sometimes become a fireball that rolls 
erratically along girders and up and down ladders. 
 
On stage two, conveyor belts that occasionally 
change direction carry trays of cement that are 
fatal to the touch. Fireballs appear from a 
central furnace. Ladders to the top level extend 
and retract. There is again a hammer that can be 
used to smash the fireballs and the cement trays. 
 
On stage three, the gorilla throws bouncing 
I-beams that must be avoided. Constantly moving 
elevators must be jumped on to progress. 
 
On stage four, eight rivets hold the top of the 
building together. Running or jumping over each 
rivet makes it disappear. When all eight rivets 
have been removed, the stage is complete, and the 
game loops back to stage one, speeding up and 
adding barrels and cement trays.

Kinetik is an arcade adventure which features 
gravity, inertia and other real physics heavily. 
You control a round spaceship, which must be 
guided through the 44+ screens. Collect the 
letters P,A and X in that order and reach the end 
to win. 
 
There are foes to avoid or shoot – some take 
objects you have but most merely drain some of 
your energy. Some walls can also be shot out. Some 
rooms have white spots which affect gravity and 
drag you inwards. 
 
Avoid contact with red walls as these drain energy

Our hero must reach Melkhior, a somewhat eccentric 
wizard who is the only one who can save him. As 
with most Ultimate titles of the day, reaching him 
is a long and treacherous challenge, involving 
both puzzle-solving and action, meaning that each 
screen requires thorough planning and precise 
navigation. 
 
The game uses the isometric viewpoint in a manner 
similar to the later Head Over Heels, using 
monochrome but detailed graphics and techniques to 
avoid flickering sprites. The game lasts for 40 
days and nights - at night your character turns 
into a werewolf. Ultimate's individual style of 
eschewing straightforward instuctions in favour of 
feature lists and riddles is put to good use here, 
with the story detailed in a rhyming poem of 
sorts.

must find a way back to his own time. 
 
Knight Tyme is the third game of the Magic Knight 
series. As in Spellbound, the previous game, the 
player interacts with the environment through the 
"Windimation" system: pressing a button brings up 
a window with a list of commands (pick 
up/drop/take/give an object, examine, command a 
character, read something, cast a spell and 
wear/unwear object). The player can scroll through 
these with the movement keys, and execute them 
with the same button used before. Spaceflight is 
part of the gameplay as the ship must visit 
several different planets. The spaceship has to be 
refueled, otherwise the character will be stuck 
forever in space. There are rooms that kill the 
knight instantaneously. Usually there is a puzzle 
associated with these rooms that must be solved in 
order to access them.

mysterious land in which legends say there are a 
lot of dangers, hidden treasures, unsolved 
mysteries, temples filled with traps... in short, 
the ingredients to which the good adventurer is 
used to deal with. 
 
The adventure is developed in the island of 
Cozumel, where you must guide an archaeologist who 
had an incident. He was sailing towards it 
perfectly equipped, when an unfortunate shipwreck 
left him without anything. Do not think he only 
lost the map or the machete, no, he lost 
everything, including the trousers and the 
underclothes, reason why it's quite possible that 
an entrance in San Marcos, coastal town near the 
place of the shipwreck, would carry serious 
problems with the justice. The main mission of the 
adventure is to discover all the hidden secrets of 
the island and then be able to escape from it. 
 
This game uses the habitual commands of the 
previous AD adventures, plus the inclusion of some 
PSI characters, it means, personages with own 
personality, decision capacity, different behavior 
according to the development of the adventure, 
that is, personages who must be treated as if they 
were real since their reactions can vary from a 
game to another. Some improvements like the 
objects treatment system have been incorporated 
(which include all their qualities)

Guerra de las Vajillas, La (c) 1988 Dinamic 
Software / Dinamic Software 
 
Karapalo emperor, leader of the imperialistic 
forces, and his vaguely cleaned up lieutenant 
Darth Water, the cavalier with the most stinky 
breath of the galaxy, are the responsibles of the 
most tyrannic government the Universe has ever 
known. Only few planets and hundreds of men stay 
rebels to the oppression of the empire. You, 
Martín Luke Skywalker, are one of them. 
 
You live in the Tutuflex planet, a desertic place 
located thousands of years light from our Solar 
System. Centuries ago, their inhabitants lived 
calmly and peacefully without more preoccupations 
than annually collecting the fruits of the 
plantations of giant turnips, the only source of 
wealth of the planet. Tutuflex saw with certain 
unconcern how the forces of the Empire, long ago a 
reduced group of mercenaries of the worst kind, 
became one of the most powerful armies of the 
universe subduing an always rising number of 
planets, everything seemed so distant… 
 
Until a sad day, the forces of the empire arrived, 
and before the pacific inhabitants of Tutuflex had 
time to ask themselves what it was happening, they 
erased by laser all sign of life and peace of the 
surface of the planet. 
 
Now you are a man without land, without family, 
without future… in your heart there's only place 
for resentment and revenge. 
 
Having explained this, it would look (and indeed 
looks) as one of the most dramatic ways to start 
an adventure, if it wasn't because it's actually a 
parody of Star Wars ("La Guerra de las Galaxias", 
not "Vajillas", in Spanish). Besides title, you 
will also notice that all names of characters, 
places, etc have been modified in order to make 
the Spanish user more familiar -in a non-serious 
way- with them. Add to it that even the most tense 
situations will have a joke surrounding them, and 
as a result you have the first integral humorous 
adventure ever made in Spain.

Lamborghini: American Challenge (c) 1992 Titus 
France SA / Titus France SA 
 
Starting out with just a basic Lamborghini and 
$6000, your aim is to rise to the top of the 4 
divisions of racing through success on 60 
racetracks across America. In each division there 
are 20 rival racers, up to 3 of which compete in 
each race at a time. 
 
The races also feature lots of local drivers (who 
can take crucial positions away from you and the 
other championship drivers), Sunday drivers going 
at normal speed, and police. before each race you 
will be told of the quality of the locals and the 
likelihood of police presence. 
 
When police are in the area, speeding beyond 110 
Km/h could see you branded as an offender, at 
which point the police will try to ram you off the 
road, Chase H.Q.-style. You can attempt to reach 
the end of the race despite this damage (which 
eventually hampers your speed), or simply pull 
over and accept a fine and the loss of race 
points. If the police subsequently stop you, the 
fine is heavier. 
 
Each race costs money to enter, and your earnings 
can be boosted by betting on the results with the 
other championship drivers. If one of you wins, 
each driver gives you either the amount they bet 
or the amount you bet, whichever is lower

Laser Squad is by the same designer as 
Microprose's classic X-Com: UFO Defense. It brings 
to the table an immersive gameplay environment as 
well as many innovative ideas that weren't 
available in any other game of the time. 
 
In Laser Squad you control a group of 
"marine"-like soldiers (and the occasional 
cyborg). Before taking them into battle, you must 
buy them weapons and armour with a predetermined 
amount of credits, taking into account the 
individual abilities of your squad. Unlike X-COM, 
the soldiers do not gain experience over time. 
 
There are 3 missions in turn - in The Assassins 
you must face down Sterner Regnix and his guards, 
Moonbase assault challenges you to destroy the 
OmniCorp database, and Rescue From the Mines 
eschews violence in favour of a rescue mission. 
These are viewed from above and progress in turns. 
Laser Squad also features a 2-player 
"hotseat"-type gaming option.

Last Duel (c) 1989 Capcom Co., Ltd. / U.S. Gold 
Ltd. 
 
Last Duel follows the story of two planets that 
are in war with each other. On the planet Bacula, 
the Galden Tribe has overthrown the government and 
seized power over the whole world. Now they want 
more – by invading the peaceful planet of Mu and 
kidnapped Queen Sheets. 
 
The Mu-ans decided to take action. They asked 
their best scientists to come up with a weapon 
that will defeat the Galdens. After many long 
months, they were able to develop a vehicle of 
immense firepower, capable of leaping into the air 
to avoid ground hazards. In addition to that, it 
can transform into an airborne vessel whose 
purpose is to eliminate any kind of enemy in the 
sky. 
 
Players have to guide their vehicle through six 
difficult levels - alternating between ground 
vehicle and fighter plane – while destroying every 
Galden that gets in their way. While progressing, 
holes in the ground need to be avoided, as players 
lose one of their ships should they happen to fall 
through one. Shooting power pods scattered around 
the level allows the player to increase their 
firepower. However, they lose that firepower if 
one of their ships is destroyed.

The Last Mission is a side-view arcade game

its inspiration from games such as Underwurlde and 
Starquake. 
 
You control a tank-like robot which can be divided 
in 
two: you rotate caterpillar and head-canyon, and 
the head part can fly off on its own. However,the 
head can only survive separately for a short 
amount of time, and your restart position is 
dictated by the location of the body, even if the 
head has moved forward through further screens. 
Therefore, the difficulty of the game was in 
making it possible to advance with the assembled 
robot's two parts.

You drive out in your specially-equipped vehicle,

must drive through narrow roads without crashing 
into anything, and with a strict deadline for your 
arrival at the base. This is somewhat complicated 
by the fact that you have only a narrow stripe of 
screen space to see where you're driving

player is offered, with his skill and form 
displayed. You can train your players to improve 
these skills, and sell players you don't rate 
highly. 
 
Matches are played out via a succession of short 
animations, in which the home side wears red and 
the away side blue. At full time you are told how 
many injuries were incurred. The league season

You control a bat, which must 'serve' the ball 
into play, and then follow it through the level, 
deflecting it before it falls behind you, as this 
costs you one of your 4 lives. Initially the 
obstacles are all static, but moving barriers add 
timing, reactions and luck to proceedings. 
 
There are also several bonus objects, which are 
collected by passing through them. These include 
an L for an extra ball and dual rectangles to give 
you a second bat which moves around at random.

Line of Fire (c) 1990 SEGA Enterprises Ltd. / U.S. 
Gold Ltd. 
 
Unusually, this Operation Wolf-influenced shoot 
'em up sees you start behind enemy lines, and 
gradually attempting to escape. As you've captured 
the Rapier machine gun your enemy have been 
developing, there are plenty who can't bear to see 
the back of you unless it's bloodied and lifeless. 
 
The game's 8 levels feature quite a variety of 
settings, vehicles and situations. You will have 
to evade fire from snipers based in windows, enemy 
jets, helicopters and well-trained marines, while 
riding tanks and speedboats as well as being on 
foot. The levels are set in locations such as the 
enemy camp, the jungle, a ruined city and the 
final flight back to your base.

Little Computer People (c) 1985 Activision, Inc. / 
Activision, Inc. 
 
This is the mother of The Sims. When you load the 
game for the first time and personalise it with 
your name you'll see a house with several rooms 
like a kitchen, living room, bed room, etc. After 
some time of waiting a little person will appear 
and check out the house with all its rooms to see 
if he likes it. If he likes it, he will move in 
shortly and bring his dog along with him. That's 
where the real "game" starts and thats what it 
will be like every time you'll load the game from 
then. You see the house and the little person 
living in it, doing all kinds of stuff people do 
in their daily routine. He'll cook, eat, feed his 
dog, read newspapers, watch TV and from time to 
time he will write you a letter to let you know 
what he feels or what things he misses. To keep it 
more gamelike, you can "talk" to him in form of 
typing commands like "feed dog". You can also play 
cards with him and send him food or a present. 
There is no aim in this game other than to 
interact with your LCP.

The Amstrad CPC appears to be the only released 
version of Grandslam's original vision of a 
licensed Liverpool FC game (a Striker-style forced 
perspective 3D game surfaced for 16-bit systems in 
1992, and a slightly simplified top-view version 
for C64 a year later). A human player must 
represent Liverpool, and can play either single 1 
or 2 player matches or a full league. The second 
team always wears white. The English Division 1 
teams of the time are included, with their 11 
first-choice players named. Attendances are 
calculated, and goalscorers are recorded. 
 
The action is viewed side-on, and uses a power bar 
to affect the strength of passes and shots -  two 
bars move along the bottom of the screen in 
sequence, and must be stopped as close together as 
possible to produce a good contact with the ball. 
 
The ball sticks to a player's foot. Players appear 
to occasionally freeze, and sometimes two players 
will get jammed together, and need a third to move 
the ball. The view is very close-up, but a scanner 
of the whole pitch is provided, as well as a 
running clock.

Livingstone, I Presume? was one of the most famous

technologically almost identical to Goody (also 
Opera's) but this game has a more complex map and 
an obligation to alternate among three weapons and 
a pole that you have from the beginning of the 
game. 
 
The name of the game indicates a tour around each 
of the searches of David Livingstone that carry 
out the journalist Henry Morton Stanley in Africa 
in the XIX century. There the resemblance to 
reality ends, and turns into a platform game.

The Bungeling Empire has stolen a huge cache of 
gold from its rightful owners, and your mission is 
to infiltrate its treasury and recapture it. This 
entails progressing through 150 screens of 
platforms, ladders and ropes. 
 
The Empire has sent robotic guards down to protect 
the gold, and contact with any of these will cost 
you a life. Your method of escaping them is to 
press fire to dig a hole in their line of 
movement, thus causing them to fall in briefly, 
allowing you to move across the gap safely. Once 
all the gold has been collected, a ladder allowing 
you to move onto the next screen is added. 
Completing these screens often requires forward 
planning and precision. 
 
This was one of the earliest games to include a 
level editor, allowing the creation of new level 
designs with no programming skill.

Lone Wolf: The Mirror of Death (c) 1991 Audiogenic 
Software Ltd. / Audiogenic Software Ltd. 
 
In this out-of-canon adventure of gamebook hero 
Kai Master Lone Wolf, the player controls the 
dashing adventurer scaling the interior of warlock 
Gorazh's sinister magic tower Kazan-Gor -- an 
inverted pyramid, broadening as it gets higher -- 
in pursuit of a Lorestone of Nyxator located at 
the very top.  Imprisoned in his flick-screen 
tower, Gorazh has filled it with monsters and 
traps, the most insidious of which was a magic 
mirror, Dhazag-Oud, whose seven shards reflect 
back superior counterparts of whoever gazes upon 
them (and which subsequently result in boss 
battles.) 
 
The gameplay largely skips over the 
choose-your-own-adventure sequences of Lone Wolf's 
gamebook roots and instead just initially prompts 
the player to select four of eight Kai skills (eg. 
Mindshield, Sixth Sense, Healing) to use (with 
restrictions) over the course of his tower 
travails.  From there, the player controls Lone 
Wolf's movements, skill use and attack strategies 
using the keyboard controls.

Loopz (c) 1990 Audiogenic Software Ltd. / 
Audiogenic Software Ltd. 
 
A puzzle game where the main goal is to make 
loops! Random pieces are presented over a board, 
including simple lines and corners as well as S 
bends and other warped shapes, of varying sizes. 
It is up to the player to link them up in a loop 
form, then moving on to the next level. Pieces can 
be placed on any empty space on the grid, and 
rotated into one of the four main compass 
directions. 
 
Any pieces which are not part of the finished loop 
when a level is completed are left on the screen, 
so there is value in playing towards 2 distinct 
loops, to ensure that you have options depending 
on which pieces are drawn - unlike Pipe Dream 
there are no clues as to which pieces are coming 
next. 
 
Three play modes are available, two of which can 
be played with two players. Game A is freestyle - 
simply make loops, gaining extra points for size 
and style. 
 
Game B is about unlocking bonus boards of the game 
by reaching a certain score. and uses a bonus 
multiplier method depending on loop difficulty. 
 
The third mode of play begins with an already made 
loop and then removes random pieces of it, so the 
player has to put them back in when they appear 
again. It is essentially a memory test and logic 
puzzle of fitting the pieces back as one remembers 
- although placing a piece where it seems to fit 
is also often effective.

Lords of Chaos (c) 1990 Target Games Limited / 
Blade Software Ltd. 
 
Turn-based strategy game based on Julian Gollop's 
earlier games, Chaos and Laser Squad. The setting 
is pure fantasy - the Old World is wrecked by 
magical discharges, and the wizards who attempted 
to keep it balanced ultimately gave up, and used 
their skill to create a new world. These Lords of 
Chaos (up to four, played either by human or 
computer) may now battle for control of this 
world. 
 
The idea of the game is to escape the level within 
a certain number of moves (preferably carrying lot 
of treasure and having killed the evil wizard 
Torquemada). Along the way you can use wizardry 
weapons and spells (there are 45 in total, created 
by combining ingredients) to conjure up mystical 
creatures like dragons and unicorns, but 
unfortunately so can Torquemada. Worlds include 
marshlands, castles and forests.

Lords of Midnight (c) 1984 
 
The Lords of Midnight brings to life this epic 
land, as Doomdark's forces aim to wrest control of 
its 4000 screens. Your initial party of the task 
contains four fighters - Luxor the Moonprince, 
Morkin (his son), Corleth the Fey and Rothron the 
Wise, each of whom has their own characteristics. 
Many more lords can be recruited as the game 
progresses, with names such as Lord Dreams, Lord 
Blood and the Utarg of Utarg. If Luxor is killed, 
only Morkin remains under human control. 
 
The game can be won in two ways - by overthrowing 
the full might of Doomdark's forces, or by 
stealing the moon ring back from its location (a 
task only Morkin can attempt), meaning that the 
game can be played as a straight strategy title or 
an RPG of sorts. 
 
The land of Midnight includes lakes, keeps, plains 
and forests (the Fey are usually located here). 
You can always look in each of the 8 compass 
directions, meaning that the game features 32000 
views - a remarkable tally in systems of this 
size. 
 
Doomdark's forces, the Foul, move at night, giving 
the game a turn-based structure. Your characters 
can also die at the hands of dragons, skulkrin and 
wolves.

complex. Luxor the Moonprince's son Morkin has 
been kidnapped by Shareth, daughter of Doomdark, 
the evil ruler deposed in the first game. The 
player initially takes control of Luxor, Rothron 
the Wise, and Morkin's lover Tarithel the Fey, 
although many more characters can be recruited as 
the game progresses, as they aim to banish Shareth 
and rescue Morkin. Shareth has brainwashed him, so 
he must also be turned back to Luxor's side. 
 
The game is effectively turn-based

Cyberman in the future, and more mundane tasks in 
the present day. To enter different time zones, go 
into the grandfather clock in your home (the 
starting location) and activate one of the nine 
cogs. 
 
Lords of Time is played by typing commands to 
guide your character, moving in compass directions 
and with standard commands such as OPEN DOOR, GET 
GLASS and EXAMINE CAR. Objects you will encounter 
include keys, an emerald and a petrol can.

The streets of Los Angeles are not safe. Lately, 
the kids are sick and tired of parents ordering 
them about and telling them what to do, so they 
decide to go out on the streets and threaten to 
club every policeman who gets in their way, making 
the streets not safe for the public, not even for 
little old ladies who decide to take a walk on a 
sunny day. 
 
The bad news is: you're a police officer 
patrolling the streets, and you have two other 
police officers at your side. Your job is to shoot 
the little troublemakers that approach you. These 
troublemakers are harmless at a distance, but they 
are known to throw fire bombs at a few policemen. 
When you are killed by one of the troublemakers, 
one of the policemen replaces you as the one who 
gets to control the streets. If there is no 
policemen left, the game is over. 
 
There are also turret guns located on top of 
buildings that fire, so you just can't stay on the 
footpath and hope not to get clobbered by the 
troublemakers. You just have to cross the road 
which is dangerous for a policeman in situations 
like this. When you come to the intersection, 
you'll come face-to-face with a gang, and you must 
shoot each gang member before they have a chance 
to leave you for dead. Once you've shoot all 
remaining gang members, a man appears holding a 
woman hostage. The object here is to shoot the man 
to free her. If you shoot the woman instead, 
you'll sacrifice 1000 points. 
 
Your score increases when you walk, but score more 
points if you manage to shoot a troublemaker. 
You'll lose 100 points for killing a lady walking 
down the footpath.

"Los lnhumanos" is a game in which our objective 
will be to rescue the girl who has been kidnapped

Besides capturing our beloved, they have also 
committed an excess which is what really did upset 
Zufuru, the inhuman protagonist of this history: 
they have destroyed his dear Simca 1000, a unique 
car, full of memories of our friend. 
 
And, as this history occurs in the city of the 
skyscrapers, the distant New York, Zufuru will 
have to cross the famous Central Park in order to 
find the resting four pieces of his little car. 
Only when all of them would be on his possession 
he will be able to accede to the Empire State, the 
second level of the game and where his beloved is 
located. 
 
For the most curious, this game debts its name to 
a Spanish pop music group which had quite succes 
during the eighties, period in which they produced 
some of the most danced songs on the Spanish 
youthful and universitary circles, that's also why 
you can listen to some of their most famous songs 
during the game, as well as seeing their mascot on

The story begins when the detective Pepe Carvalho 
(or in this case, you), receives a mysterious 
phone call from Bangkok by an old friend, Teresa 
Marsé, who is requesting you to come there to her 
help as she claims some people want to kill her. 
 
With this information, you meet all her family in 
the travel agency which took her to Bangkok, where 
his guide informs everyone about what happened: 
"In Bangkok, Teresa met a young native -Archit- 
for which she falls in love, but he turns out to 
be a a diamond smuggler. Teresa has the "great" 
idea to convince him to steal diamonds of his 
boss, Jungle Kid, but the latter's son discovers 
it, Archit and had no other choice but to kill 
him. Now the whole Thai Mafia pursues them, and it 
will be difficult for them to escape." 
 
With all this, nobody seems to want to go to in 
the search for Teresa or hire someone to travel. 
You get to convince his father that something must 
be done, and you get chosen as a volunteer after 
discussing the trip price with the owner of the 
agency. But he refuses to give you more than 
200,000 búths for the travel... 
 
After a long journey by plane you finally arrive 
in Bangkok, and you do not know where to start 
looking. You just know that you have to go to the 
Spanish embassy in Bangkok, where the ambassador 
will explain in greater depth your mission. 
 
Los Pájaros de Bangkok is a conversational

The first in a series of 3 racing games endorsed 
by the legendary car company, which is now a part 
of Proton. 
 
The game features a total of 32 fictitious 
racetracks from around the world, split into 3 
difficulty levels. There are 19 computer opponents 
(15 on the 8-bit versions) and you have to finish 
in the top 10 (top 8 on the 8-bits) to progress. 
The higher you finish in one race, the lower down 
the grid you start for the next race. The 
opposition drivers have pun names based on the F1 
drivers of the day - examples include Ricardo 
Pastry and Crashhard Banger. 
 
You can choose between sound effects or one of a 
variety of music pieces. The game features a 
simultaneous 2-player mode, but the 1-player mode 
only uses half the screen, a simple animation 
filling the other half. In most races you will 
have to make a pitstop for fuel in order to reach 
the finish. The tracks include features such as 
oil slicks, roadworks, boulders and rivers - 
contact with these (or the other cars) will slow 
you, but there is no car damage model.

Lucky Luke - Nitroglycerine (c) 1987 Coktel Vision 
/ Cedic Vifi 
 
This multi-genre game is based on the famous 
comics series about Lucky Luke, a good cowboy who 
draws his gun and shoots quicker than his shadow. 
 
It was decided to construct a railway line to 
connect the East and West of the United States. 
Two companies argued about the establishment of 
this line. You were chosen to protect the quality 
of the line and to do not give it away to the 
competitor. 
 
In the beginning, Lucky Luke should move around 
the town and find out the bandits preventing him 
from travel on the train. During arcade shooting 
he should shoot all of them on the streets and 
inside the saloon. 
 
After train stops in front of the boulder on the 
rails, Lucky Luke has to find the way to this 
boulder to blow it up with a bomb collecting the 
useful items and using them in adventure mode. 
During these actions he'll encounter four Daltons 
and Apache's leader. 
 
The next trial is a puzzle, where Lucky Luke has 
to connect the branch lines for the train 
switching the points on the railway. 
 
And the last one is to solve the problem of water 
between Comanches and the Ranch owners in the 
place where quality will be checked finally.

A single classical-style pinball table is provided 
in this simulation. A table editor is also 
provided - this allows you to choose a shape for 
the table and arrange the component parts as you 
wish. Up to four players can take it in turns, 
each with five balls in turn. 
 
Unusually, the default table has multiple flippers 
at the bottom of the table, as well as some 
located higher up. Use them to return a ball 
higher on table and to prevent it being lost at 
the bottom of the table. Hitting some valuable 
areas of table gives you a bonus. Gain as many 
points as possible to rack up a high score.

a ball simply known as Dust Brain comes in. It is 
his quest to persuade the other Madballs on the 
planet to join him in his quest for power, and he 
does this by bumping them off the 
multi-directionally scrolling platforms. Once a 
Madball has been persuaded, it appears in a tube 
at the bottom of the screen. When a Madball ends 
up in the tube, Dust Brain must find the 
'downtube' exit so that he can pursue other 
Madballs. 
 
While searching for other Madballs, Dust Brain 
encounters many obstacles that include 
trampolines, springboards, catapults, ramps, 
pyramids, and oil slicks

Navigate the maze you're trapped in and gobble up 
food while trying to avoid the ghosts that are

As a Pac-Man variant, there are some changes made 
to distinguish itself. Some levels offer 
transformative powers. These include being turned 
into a hippopotamus - which allows you to step on 
ghosts - and a vacuum cleaner - to clean up 
pellets corrupted by a wandering enemy. On some 
levels, you can also briefly turn the protagonist 
into a spaceship or a tank, where you can shoot 
ghosts from a fixed vantage point.

Peace had arrived finally at "Cocovillage" thanks 
to the good work made by Mad Mix, who had become 
the worthy successor of his grandfather. But the 
nightmare had still not finished, because a few 
miles away, in the town of his cousin Ope, 
"Cococastle" (a place crowned by a phantasmagoric 
Castle), it was happening a strange phenomena. All 
the indications made think that a "coco", survivor 
of "Cocovillage", had converted the Castle into 
his dwelling, establishing in addition a 
maleficent alliance with the sinister inhabitants 
from that place. The terror had seized the 
inhabitants of "Cococastle", and only Mad can give 
back the tranquillity to the pacific inhabitants 
of this village. 
 
The game consists in eating all the "coconuts" 
(small ball species that are dispersed through all 
the Castle) which appear at every moment. Once you 
have finished with all the coconuts of the level 
you will pass to the following stay of the Castle 
of the Ghosts, this is the mechanic until you have 
been able to explore all its corners. However, you 
shouldn't care only in eating all the "coconuts", 
but in addition you will have to be very kind 
trying to not collide with any of the inhabitants 
of the terrific Castle, as well as to avoid the 
different traps (or using them in your own 
benefit) while taking helpful -some with really 
curious effects- objects.

Magic Johnson's Basketball (c) 1990 Arcadia 
Systems, Inc. / Dro Soft 
 
Magic Johnson's Fast Break is fast-paced 
two-on-two action rather than the usual 
five-on-five contest. On screen you get a 
full-court, horizontally-scrolling gameplay. A 
referee monitors the action and calls the fouls if 
the gameplay gets too rough, and a crowd cheers 
you on. 
 
Your team starts each game at a certain salary 
level. Your goal is to beat the opposition to earn 
a larger salary. Keep winning and you might etch 
your name onto the Big Earners Screen. Choose from 
five skill levels - Rookie to Professional. Each 
level provides quicker gameplay, tougher defense, 
and bigger bucks if you win. 
 
Each game lasts four three-minute, real-life 
quarters. In between quarters, you can review 
stats such as field goal percentage, 
three-pointers made, rebounds, and steals. If the 
score is tied at the final buzzer, you play 
additional quarters until someone wins. 
 
You control one player at a time. An arrow appears 
on-screen above the head of the player you're 
running. Just hit B to switch players. You can 
play against the computer or up to three friends.

Marble Madness involved guiding a ball through

back to the start of a screen. The initial home 
licensing was split – Electronic Arts converted 
the arcade game itself to several systems, whilst 
Melbourne House provided their own level set, but 
more significantly designed an environment 
allowing players to create their own levels. 
 
Angled and slanted ramps can be placed anywhere, 
either on a blank screen or to edit an existing 
level. Enemies can be placed anywhere, these will 
follow their own paths once you play the game. 
Time / points bonuses and oil slicks can also be 
added to the levels. A complete block of levels 
can be saved to create a game set of its own. 
Designs can be tested out before being committed 
to storage.

Marsport is the first (and ultimately only) game 
in an unfinished trilogy set in the 25th century. 
Humanity is at war with the Sept alien race, and 
they are now in a position to invade Earth, as 
they have the plans for their protective sphere. 
You play John Marsh, a soldier turned leader who 
must go to Mars and locate the original plans. 
 
Marsport uses the same game system as Tir Na Nog 
and Dun Darach, although a 3D effect is 
incorporated into the graphics. A single path is 
displayed on screen at a time, and the view is 
rotated at junctions. The Warriors and Warlords 
must be shot down using weaponry, making this 
Gargoyle's most action-driven adventure up to this 
point. 
 
The Marsport is split into ten distinct sections 
with their own functions, such as Stores, 
Administration and Computers. There are robots to 
interact with, for gaining information or objects. 
Pairs of objects can be combined to manufacture 
new ones. A central computer locks out many 
sections until it can be found and disabled. You 
will have to shoot the Sept before they can touch 
you, and also be wary of Warden robots which may 
malfunction and mistake you for a Sept.

authored by Kenneth Harper and illustrated by 
Bruce Hogarth, and comics. A new line of toys was 
produced to accompany each TV series. 
 
The stories all centre around the M.A.S.K. 
organisation led by the fearless Matt Tracker. 
M.A.S.K. agents wear helmets or masks to protect 
their identities and to give them super powers 
which help in their fight against the criminal 
V.E.N.O.M. organisation. They drive super powered 
vehicles which can transform. 
V.E.N.O.M., aka the Vicious Evil Network of 
  Mayhem, are the bad guys. They are by Miles 
  Mayhem one time friend of Matt and co-founder of 
  MASK who betrayed Matt long ago. 
 
There are four areas to the game and in all Matt 
must drive his Thunderhawk vehicle around the game 
area, avoiding V.E.N.O.M.'s armoured vehicles and 
tanks while accomplishing tasks in a specific 
order. 
In area 1 : Boulder Hill, his first task is to 
recover his own mask and later an abducted agent. 
However it's not just a case of driving around 
until the agent is found. Matt must first and 
collect a scanner which will direct him the 
missing agent (who will be hidden). However the 
agent cannot be picked up until his mask has been 
collected and the scanner will not function until 
the four pieces of the security key have been 
collected and assembled. Items, including bombs, 
are collected by driving over them. Bombs are 
Matt's only weapon against V.E.N.O.M.'s tanks and, 
as bombs do, they will damage Matt and his vehicle 
if he's too close to the explosion. 
 
The remainder of the game consists of three more 
areas, Prehistoric, Far Future, and VENOM Base 
each of which have two abducted agents to rescue.

Master Chess (c) 1987 Mastertronic Ltd. / 
Mastertronic Ltd. 
 
The ancient game of chess is recreated here, with 
all the traditional rules and game concepts. The 
game is in 2D, as the programmers felt this was 
the most effective use of available memory. 
Controls involve moving a pointer over the square 
to move a piece from, pressing space, then moving 
to the destination square and pressing space 
again. You can set the amount of time players 
(human and computer) have to plan moves, although 
an over-ride option to force a move instantly also 
exists. You can save and reload games, and at any 
point can move pieces either from current settings 
or from scratch, to completely customise the game 
or play out classic positions.

Master of the Lamps (c) 1985 Activision, Inc. /

Master of the Lamps casts you as an Eastern prince 
hoping to become King. There are two distinct 
gameplay sections, through which he must prove his 
worthiness. Firstly, you must ride a magic carpet, 
flying through a series of diamonds which twists 
and turns more as you move through the 41 levels. 
 
Alternating with this, you are in front of a row 
of pipes. Hit a gong 3 times to summon a genie, 
who will play a sequence of notes. Once the last 
one has been played, they fly towards you in 
order, and their colour equivalent on the row must 
be hit (the number of times they are played), 
before the flying note can hurt you. Complete this 
and a piece of lamp is granted.

Queen of explosive, she will have to collect the 
dynamites scattered within embassy and blow up the 
strong doors and safes, where diskettes (CPC) / 
keys (ST) are hidden, which allow to reach the 
upper floors by the elevator. Every wrong move of 
MATA HARI means her coma and every coma of MATA 
HARI throws her into embassy's hospital, from 
where she may exit optionally (in Amstrad CPC 
version) or fighting with a guard (in Atari ST

The original Match Day was the first serious

emerged over 2 years later. League and Cup 
tournaments for up to 8 teams (any or all of which 
can be human-controlled) are offered alongside 
one-off Friendly matches with a handicap option - 
passcodes are given to allow you to restore these 
to the same state another day. 
 
Matches are seven-a-side, with variable lengths 
from 10 to 30 minutes. All kicks except set pieces 
are variable in strength using a Kick-o-meter 
which is displayed on screen. One revolutionary 
feature of the game was the Diamond Deflection 
System, which mathematically calculated the angle 
and pace of any rebounds.

$bio
 
 
Max Headroom (c) 1986 Binary Design, Ltd. / 
Quicksilva Ltd. 
 
This game is based on a 1984 British television 
movie which led to a 14-episode television series 
that ran in 1987 in the U.S.  It's an early 
cyberpunk vision set "twenty minutes in the 
future" where powerful corporations rule and 
compete for television ratings and consumer 
dollars.  Edison Carter is an investigative 
reporter for Network 23 seeking to free his alter 
ego Max Headroom, a cybernetic construct of his 
mind that was stored after Edison was involved in 
a motorcycle accident and the last thing he saw 
before losing consciousness was a "Max Headroom" 
sign going into a tunnel.  Max lives in computers 
and can appear on any screen, television or any 
electronic device.  The character is actually Matt 
Frewer in a latex mask, edited so as to appear 
jittery and stuttering like an early computer 
model. 
 
In the game, Max has been abducted by Network 23 
and you must retrieve him from somewhere in the 11 
top floors of their high-rise building starting at 
the 200th floor.  Security systems protect each 
floor and you have to find and enter the correct 
codes to gain access from the elevators.  Each 
floor seen in isometric view, has lines 
representing walls of various rooms with doors and 
office furniture.  Robots will chase and fire at 
you and decrease your health level as shown on the 
biomonitor at bottom of screen.  Also indicated 
are the floor number and time left.  On the right 
side of screen are 4 icons for Reporter E. Carter 
which open a door, call elevator, view through 
camera, or allow movement to run around the floor. 
 On the left side are icons for Controller T. 
Jones (Theora helps you hack into systems) to show 
you the floor and computer circuits. 
 
When entering a security code, it takes the form 
of an LED digit over which you must move a pointer 
over a row of circuit lines in order to activate 
various segments to form a desired digit.  Each 
segment will remain lit only temporarily so when 
time runs out you must ensure that the letter is 
fully lit or your code will fail.  In that event, 
you must make your way across the floor to the 
second elevator and try again.

It is a very strange universe really - isn´t it? 
All those millions of planets and moons and stars 
and comets swirling about in the vastness of 
space. Imagine what fun it would be to explore - 
to boldly go where no boldly goer had boldly gone 
before - unless they happened to live there. 
 
Latest research from the Institute of Advanced 
Research (I.A.R.) indicated that there are quite a 
lot of planets with things living on them. Some of 
these things are pretty intelligent like us 
really. Other of these things are really stupid, 
like whelks, for example. 
 
Anyway, to cut a long story short, you have been 
selected to explore the universe, boldly seeking 
out strange and exciting new worlds. If you find 
any, your instructions are quite clear. 
 
BLAST THE LIVING DAYLIGHTS OUT OF THEM!!

Megacorp (c) 1987 Dinamic Software / Dinamic 
Software 
 
In the XXII century the universe is dominated by 
two major forces born after decades of major wars: 
the Empire and the Hark Federation. Being both of 
them expansionist governments, frictions in their 
borders are almost constant. 
 
Within the Empire, the biggest power after the 
emperor himself, are the Mega Corporations, 
financial partnerships that control every aspect 
of people's lives. With power of life and death, 
these Mega-Corp, as they are familiarly known, 
extend their tentacles by the Cosmos in search of 
riches to extract or eventually snatch. 
 
The federal system consists in the "adoption" 
under its tutelage of technologically poor 
planetary systems in general, although rich in 
material or manpower that are invariably employed 
in improving the resources of the originary Hark 
planets. 
 
"Megacorp" is a conversational adventure with 
static graphics in which you will take part of the 
Imperial federation. Your exact mission would be 
guiding your operative agent to get control of the 
situation on the GEA-3 planet. You should, helping 
rebel groups, overthrow the government, now in the 
hands of The Federation. 
 
Your craft will land on the forest surrounding the 
rebel base. Cross the lake, pass police checks and 
find your link to be identified by their status as 
merchant in fur, from here follow his 
instructions. The mission is risky but the reward 
is great, if you make GEA-3 planet be part of the 
Empire, you will get immensely rich.

Mega Phoenix (c) 1991 Creepsoft / Dinamic Software 
 
Mega Phoenix brings the concept of the earlier 
arcade game Phoenix into the 90s, to the extent 
that a coin-op version was later made by Gaelco. 
The game is a single-screen shoot ‘em up in which 
the player moves left to right while shooting 
several waves. There is a shield function 
available, which lasts for a short period of time 
(after which it must recharge to be used again) 
and it paralyses the craft while active. 
 
The first waves consist of several small alien 
beings in a set pattern, which move down from the 
fleet towards the player at random intervals- 
contacts with these kills the player. Deadly 
phoenixes firing at you come next, followed by the 
Mega Phoenix itself and then a final boss, before 
it all repeats with higher difficulty.

Martinique. You, an expert in paranormal 
phenomena, arrive by ship at the town St Pierre on 
Martinique on May 7, 1902, a day before volcano 
Mount Pelée will erupt and destroy the town. You 
are invited by your friends, Geneviève and Michel 
Hubert-Destouches to investigate what is happening 
in their house, which seems to be haunted by a 
zombie. It's your task to find out what has 
happened and to find a way to let your friends 
live in peace again. 
 
With a "colibri cursor" you can click on a map to 
visit various locations on the island (thanks to 
your own paranormal abilities you can explore 
places as a colibri). By 
investigating/interrogating the player also learns 
about the  history of the island (especially 
during an extensive multiple choice puzzle). Some 
of the puzzles require that the player types in 
the right answer. 
The game has a small inventory (with three slots) 
and a scoring system with a maximum of 99 points. 
It includes some animations, music and sound. It 
was published in a German and French version. The 
manual includes a short story by the Martinician 
author Patrick Chamoiseau and a calalou recipe

In this spin-off from a popular TV cop show of the

drugs ring bossed by Mr. J. You have to start at 
the bottom, initially busting the casual dealers 
before reaching their suppliers, and ultimately 
the casino-dwelling honchos. 
 
This is done through a combination of driving and 
shooting, through an overhead rendition of Miami. 
When crooks are stopped they will often provide 
valuable information, although sometimes they can 
only be stopped by shooting them. 
 
When you learn of a meeting, you can enter it on 
foot, either to gain evidence or make an arrest - 
but remember that a joint full of crooks will not 
simply allow you to do your civic duty. This is 
all done against a time limit, with a one-minute 
penalty for crashing the car.

Mickey Mouse (c) 1988 Gremlin Graphics Software 
Ltd. / Gremlin Graphics Software Ltd. 
 
The Ogre King and his minions have taken over 
Disney Castle, and it's Mickey's task to win it 
back. The game starts on a sequence of stairways, 
up which Mickey must move, shooting any creatures 
that get in his way. Eventually you will come to a 
door and go through it, at which point the second 
section of the game begins. 
 
These are viewed from above, and see Mickey 
negotiate his way through a multi-screen maze, 
with multiple exits on each screen. Ghosts and 
ogres block his path, but he's armed with a water 
pistol for the former and an axe for the latter, 
both of which need replenishing regularly. Some 
doors require keys to move through. 
 
There are several sub-games, including Pac-Man and 
Donkey Kong-derived games. To win the game you 
must finally beat the Ogre King.

The Outdoor game is the normal European soccer. 
You may play single matches, league or tournament 
(world championships). Optional features are: 
weather effects, replays, customizable game 
length. Some quite funny movements and shots are 
available (e.g. banana flanks). 
 
The Indoor game has US soccer teams (?fictional?) 
and plays on a much smaller field. It has 
different rules compared to outdoor soccer. You 
can play single matches, league and All Star 
tournament. The same movements and shots can be 
made, sometimes with even funnier effects (e.g. 
banana shot bouncing of the wall and into goal).

platform-based levels, each ending with a Boss to 
defeat. Your enemies appear on foot and in 
vehicles, and Crimson has also planted machine gun 
bays en route. 
 
Dead enemies release keys, which can be traded in 
at shop points for weapons. These weapons include 
machine guns and flamethrowers, for which 
ammunition must be bought - weapons are discarded 
when you have no suitable ammo. The control system 
is unusual - you can shoot in different directions

Mikie (c) 1986 Konami Corporation / Imagine 
 
Mikie puts you in charge of Mikie, a high school 
student who likes to win hearts of every girl that 
he can lay his eyes on. 
 
There are several classrooms to explore like the 
Quantum Physics Room, Locker Room, Canteen, the 
Aerobics Dancing Class, and the Playground. In 
each classroom, Mikie has to collect all the 
hearts that are found in each classroom to form a 
message. In order to collect these hearts, Mikie 
must stand somewhere near them and shout out. 
There are two type of hearts: small  and large. 
Mikie needs to shout out only once to collect the 
small hearts, and multiple times to collect the 
large ones. When a message is formed, Mikie can 
exit the classroom through a door marked OUT. 
 
Stopping him from collecting the hearts is the 
teacher, the chef, and the janitor. The teacher is 
the worst one. When he is unable to  catch you, he 
works up a sweat, and eventually, throws his teeth 
at you. When his teeth hits Mikie, he loses one of 
his three lives. In later classrooms, Mikie can 
throw stuff at his enemies in order to stun them 
for several seconds (for instance, the basketballs 
in the locker room, and the chickens in the 
canteen). The janitor isn't as bad because he 
walks much slower than the others. 
 
In between levels, you have to enter the next 
classroom through a door marked IN without being 
caught, but you can do at least two things to pass 
time: Steal some lunch, and open one of the 
unmarked doors to receive a punch, a kick, or the 
chance to see a naked lady with breasts. Beware 
that if you take too long in the hallway and don't 
travel between floors, a bucket slides across the 
screen real fast and attempt to slip you. 
 
If you're good enough at the game, you can enter a 
high score, and if you fail to enter anything, the 
game will assume that you are Clint Eastwood.

Mind Fighter (c) 1988 Abstract Concepts|Infinite 
Imaginations / Activision (UK) Limited 
 
The computer game of an Anna Popkess book (which 
was originally bundled with the game) uses an 
interactive fiction System Without A Name, or SWAN 
for short. It’s set in a post-apocalyptic world of 
guards desperately attempting to retain order over 
mobs of genetically-mutated thugs, with extensive 
use of the death penalty. 
 
Into this maelstrom steps Robin, an 11-year-old 
psychic beamed forward in time from before the 
drama. Adjusting to a completely different form of 
life, Robin must learn to survive and get adequate 
food, and ultimately infiltrate this vicious 
police state. 
 
Encounters with other characters are frequent, of 
whom some retain a semblance of old humanity. 
Daryl, Alison and Matthew all come in handy, and 
must be coaxed into doing what you wish. Examining 
objects often gives few clues, so the detail in 
the manual is vital, although few of the objects 
are vastly different from familiar 20th century 
artifacts. Two levels of object descriptions 
exist, allowing for faster or more immersive play.

This abstract puzzler promises 999,999 different 
levels, with a game design bearing some relation 
to sliding-block games. You are presented with up 
to 24 coloured and spotted (like dice) blocks, 
arranged in columns of up to 4. The task is to 
arrange these so that they are lined up in columns 
matching their number. 
 
You are in control of a crosshair, which can be 
moved to cover four blocks. Holding fire while 
pushing left or right and hovering it over a group 
of 4 will move the four blocks around in sequence. 
Things can get harder when the level arrangement 
results in blocks having to be moved through 
sections with a column of only 2, or when some 
parts of the arena lack cogs, meaning that you 
can't move on those sections. Later in the game 
you'll have to work on multiple floors at the same 
time, switching blocks between them.

key, which the porter has hold of – he must be

order to finally diffuse the bomb. Secrets can be 
gleaned from the opposing hijackers, and from the 
barman. In some cases furniture can be used to 
your advantage.

Molecule Man is trapped inside a radioactive maze

To do this you must collect 16 circuits which are

regularly consume radiation tablets to fend off 
certain poisoning, and your initial supply of 20 
is totally inadequate. 
 
Fortunately, there are coins dotted around the 
levels, as well as ant-radiation tablet vending 
machines at which you can buy them. Coins can also 
be used to buy more time, or to blow up obstacles 
which make some sections difficult or impossible 
to access. 
 
Viewed isometrically, the screen designs are 
intentionally surreal, each taking on an unlikely 
distorted real-world theme. If you find the

treasure for itself? Or is the ghost a fake - just 
someone dressing up to frighten Tamara? If so, 
why?

positive way for centuries. However, they have 
been dying out through old age, and so have built 
a time machine. 
 
A younger Ancient One named Bostafer scuppered 
this, destroying the machine in the hope of using 
it to make himself immortal. Can you retrieve all 
the pieces from time and space before Bostafer?The 
pieces have attained mythical status in some 
cultures, so retrieving them may not be an easy 
task. 
 
Mordon's Quest is a pure-text IF game containing 
150 locations and understanding over 400 words. 
Items you will find early in the game include a 
blowpipe, a black pearl and a crystal orb. 
Commands include CLIMB, SACRIFICE and INSERT, as 
well as standard movement and object-retrieval 
methods.

The famous crazy-scientist Dr. Bacterio was 
experimenting with hens to let them grow to the 
size of a horse, thus trying definitively to end 
the hunger in the world.  But, as was habitual in 
his experiments, he had failed in his objective 
and now a gang of uncontrolled hens is circulating 
around the city putting eggs on the street.  But 
certain special eggs have the capacity to turn one 
person into a hen (or at least that's what they 
believed) if the egg crushes on his head. 
 
Is the sequel of the first game dedicated to the 
famous Ibañez's comicbook saga, "Mortadelo y 
Filemón", known as "Clever & Smart" or "Flip & 
Flop" outside Spain.

time and space as easily as you go from your 
bedroom to the kitchen. 
 
Moreover, MOT has the bad habits of hiding in your 
cupboard, smashing all the furniture in your house 
from time to time or eating all the food in your 
fridge during the night. 
And of course,  when you tried to explain to your 
parents that it wasn't you but MOT who crushed 
their car, they sent you to a psychiatrist. 
 
But MOT is your friend, and you wouldn't let him 
down when he calls for your help, would you ?

hazards including water, logs and stationary cars. 
The faster you complete the course, the more prize 
money you receive. Repairs to any damage to the 
bike (incurred by contact with the aforementioned 
hazards) must be paid for from this, but the rest 
can be spent on upgrades. The controls are

In this game, you control a bumper car, and the 
object is to bump your opponents off the gameboard 
while they do the same to you, and once you have 
managed to bump all your opponents off the board, 
you move on to the next round. If you take too 
long to complete a round, a fireball will strike 
one of the tiles on the board, causing them to 
collapse and making it more likely that you or 
your opponents are killed. In some rounds, you can 
get power-ups that give you extra bumping powers 
and the ability to jump over gaps. When you jump, 
you can break a tile to the point where it 
collapses, making it easier for opponents to fall 
down the gap that will be left there.

your newly-acquired motorcycle with the multiple 
obstacles you will find, at the same time you get 
rid of the mutants, whereas you go to the 
laboratory where you will have to liberate the 
kidnapped scientists.  It won't be easy - you will

choice, those being grenades, a pistol and an

be switched at any moment by typing 1, 2 or 3. 
 
Once the three travelers are reunited, every 
screen acts as a puzzle of sorts: the player is

character before enemies appear. When they do, two 
of the characters will react automatically to the 
enemies, and the player will directly control the 
last character. If all enemies in the screen are

In this platform game, you are a mere mortal who 
has been called by the Gods to defeat several 
mythological creatures that have been turned bad 
by the evil Dameron. 
 
Myth: History in the Making is a platform game 
with a lot of fighting. The levels of this game 
deal with different mythologies, from ancient 
Greece to the Vikings, over to Valhalla (where 
none other than the hammer-wielding Thor awaits 
you), and more. 
 
Apart from jumping from platform to platform, 
you'll also fight the enemies and bosses in your 
path with a variety of weapons - in the beginning 
you have only fists to defend yourself, but later 
you'll find more powerful weapons, such as swords 
and axes. There are many various types of enemies, 
different on every level. Typically, enemies keep 
appearing and coming at you from all sides, no 
matter how many of them you kill - so you have to 
keep moving. 
 
Some obstacles in the game require not only brute 
force, but also a bit of thinking and 
puzzle-solving (and guesswork) to get past.

NARC (c) 1990 Williams Electronic Games, Inc. / 
Ocean Software Ltd. 
 
Narc is a 1-2 player game, where your mission is 
to infiltrate the Mr. Big Corporation, the scourge 
of the underworld. To do this, you must get 
through the game's eight stages, with over ten 
sectors like the junkyard, subway, drug lab, 
nursery, downtown, Sunset Strip, and even the 
corporation, where Mr. Big resides. In order to 
get through the stages, you are required to 
collect a number of safe cards, and insert them in 
the slot next to the stage exit.  Each sector 
includes a map, and should be easy to read. For 
example, the blue or red dots represent you, and 
the white dots are the missile launchers, while 
the "E" indicates the exit. 
 
Your mission ain't going to be easy, as you will 
come face-to-face with enemies including the 
canine mutts, Das Lof Gang, Dr. Spike Rush, Joe 
Rockhead, Kinky Pinky, Sgt. Skyhigh, HQ Posse, and 
Mr. Big himself. You have two ways you can deal 
with them: either put a bullet in them or make 
arrests. Furthermore, they will try to blow you up 
the minute they see you. Fortunately, you're armed 
with a shotgun and missile launcher, but these 
both have a limited supply of ammunition. If your 
bullet counter reaches one, you can only fire one 
bullet at a time, so you need to find some more. 
Also, it is important not to waste all of your 
missiles: you might need them later when you deal 
with later enemies like Mr. Big. You are also 
backed up by a chopper and a mean shiny street 
machine. 
 
More often than not, when you blow up enemies, you 
can pick up several items that they drop, 
including drugs, money, ammunition, missile 
launchers, and if you're lucky, safe cards.  Even 
if you got the safe card and can pass the level, 
you can keep blowing up enemies to score more 
points. According to the game, this game is for 
training purposes only, so you will not get 
employed by your local DEA office. Is this what 
the DEA does every day: go on rampages?

pacification forces. My mission: find and destroy 
a nuclear submarine U-5544 that has unbalanced the 
forces between the two most powerful Earth armies. 
The name of the operation is Cephalopod and I have 
heard that you want to help me in this "easy" 
mission. 
 
At first, we will be sent near the island where is 
anchored the submarine awaiting orders. We will 
swim to the coast, and once there... everything 
will depend on us. 
 
"Navy Moves" is a one-dimensional side scrolling 
shooter, and the sequel of "Army Moves" and has 
the same gaming style.

Navy Seals (c) 1990 Ocean Software Ltd. / Ocean

Like many of Ocean's games this was licensed from 
a film,in this case one by Orion, the company best 
known for Robocop. You control a succession of the 
USA's elite fighters with the aim of destroying 
missiles held by terrorists. You must destroy the 
missiles by placing bombs next to them and then 
fleeing the scene. 
 
You will of course meet many more fighters 
throughout the level, and pick up improved weapons 
as the game goes on (neither of which fit with the 
film, or real-life logic, but make for Generic 
Ocean Film License #718). The gameplay is 
primarily side-scrolling, but the levels are 
taller than the screen.

NEIL Android (c) 1988 Alternative Software Ltd. /

In the year 2099, the spaceship EPIC makes another 
one of her journeys when she is suddenly caught in 
a plasma storm, forcing her off course into 
unmapped. Due to the damaged caused by the storm, 
the EPIC was forced to land on an uninhabited 
planet to make urgent repairs. While on the 
planet, the ship's crew had no idea that an 
unknown virus made its way onto the ship. Upon 
returning to the EPIC's home base of Altontron, 
the crew became aware that the ship had been 
infected by the alien life form. 
 
They have sent an android called NEIL to get rid 
of the aliens. Each room of the ship contains nine 
green aliens that NEIL needs to destroy. As well 
as these aliens, there are also robots that come 
in the room from time to time. When shot, these 
robots leave behind cells, which give NEIL extra 
ammunition, allow him to replenish his air supply, 
or use a smart bomb which kills all aliens in the 
room. Finding a turbo lift allows NEIL to travel 
between floors.

Dead Terminators remain on the screen - when you 
are not doing well, Torquemata can sometimes turn 
these into vicious scythe-wielding zombies.

Nether Earth is arguably the first classic real

between humans and ancient race of aliens called 
Insignian. On mysterious planet there are four 
bases to conquer and to win a war - Kerberus, 
Tarras, Faretra and Diolkos. Only way, how to 
fight, is to use factories to build giant battle 
robots, similar to Mech units in other games. 
Commanding robots, capturing factories and 
defeating enemy in realtime - is primary goal for 
player. 
 
In Nether Earth is player controlling small flying 
robot, instead of mouse cursor in Dune 2 and later 
RTS games. With this robot you can enter a 
factory, design your unique battle robot from few 
parts like wheels, antigrav, radar, laser gun or 
nuclear weapon. After that you have to command 
your robot. Artifical Intelligence is great for a 
time, but in though times is possible to control 
robot manualy. Every captured factory means 
difference in tactics, because of power ballance. 
Computer AI has no advantage of you, its pure 
strategy in real time.

New Zealand Story, The (c) 1989 Taito Corporation 
/ Ocean Software Ltd. 
 
One day, a kiwi tribe was having fun and games 
outside the zoo, only to be kidnapped by the 
evil-minded Leopard Seal, who plans to sell them 
at the black market. Fortunately, during the 
kidnapping process, Tiki, leader of the tribe, 
managed to escape the sack, and her job is to 
rescue Phee-Phee and the other kiwis scattered 
around New Zealand, and are held in cages in 
various locations that include Auckland, Rotorua, 
Waitomo Caves, Strait Cook, and Mt. Cook. 
 
If Tiki doesn't rescue a kiwi in a limited amount 
of time, the devil will appear and try to kill 
her. When Tiki reaches the outskirts of each city, 
except Strait Cook, there is a boss waiting to 
meet Tiki, and kill her by using their own choice 
of weapons. Also making the rescue mission 
difficult are several nasties that attempt to 
throw their own weapons, like bombs and arrows, at 
her. To defeat these enemies, Tiki shoots at them 
using her crossbow and arrows. More often than 
not, when Tiki shoots at enemies, they will leave 
behind pieces of fruit that she can pick up for 
points. However, it is likely that Tiki may get 
other weapons or the letters E, X, T, E, N, and D. 
Collecting all these letters will result in an 
extra life, and as for the weapons, they include 
laser shots, bombs, and fireballs. 
 
In some levels, a few areas are located further up 
than just left or right, and the only way that 
Tiki can go up is by snatching something off the 
enemy that gives her the ability to fly up. Other 
areas are underwater, and when Tiki goes 
underwater, her oxygen  meter decreases, so she 
has to rise up to the surface again to restore her 
oxygen levels. Apart from her own weapons, Tiki is 
able to squirt water at enemies if she gets to the 
top of the water.

Nigel Mansell's Grand Prix (c) 1988 DJL Software 
Ltd. / Martech 
 
Nigel Mansell's first licensed computer game 
recreates all 16 Formula 1 circuits of the time, 
viewed from behind the car but with a full 
cockpit-type view below. This is important because 
the game is very much a simulation rather than an 
action game. 
 
Before each race you have to do three qualifying 
laps, and only make the grid if you are fast 
enough to meet the pre-defined qualifying limit. 
The races can be between 5 and 20 laps, or at full 
length if you prefer - fortunately a half-finished 
season can be saved to cassette or disk. 
 
F1 cars of this era have turbo boosts, and this is 
available in the game to provide a quick blast of 
extra speed, which is useful for overtaking but 
can cause the turbo or the engine itself to be 
overstressed, as well as using fuel more quickly 
(pitstops are for tires but not fuel, again in 
keeping with the era's real Formula 1 rules).

championship had finally come good. The game was 
pitched somewhere in between a full-blown 
simulation like F1 GP and action games like 
Continental Circus. Only 12 cars were in each 
race, which could last from between 3 and 20 laps. 
 
Before each race you can customize wing downforce, 
gear ratio, tyre selection and fuel load choices – 
pitstops are a standard feature of the longer 
races. The 16-bit versions include a unique 
'Improve With Mansell' mode, in which a digitized 
version of Nigel's head appears in the top corner 
of the screen, offering instructions and praise.

Between the Seas of the Seven Islands and the

area was safe and hospitable, however darkness 
then came - killing many of the inhabitants and 
warping the minds of the others. Many have gone 
there, none have returned - can you be the first? 
 
Nightshade is an arcade adventure in scrolling 
isometric 3D (an advance on earlier Ultimate 
titles such as Knight Lore, which were 
flick-screen), with directional or rotational 
controls. You can take 3 hits from the various 
roaming monsters - turning from white to yellow to 
green as you take them - but a 4th costs you one 
of your five lives. Objects can be thrown at these 
foes, but only if you have any. 
 
The map is made up of medieval-style buildings, 
which are visible while you are on the outside but 
whose roofs lift when you enter them, to ensure 
full visibility. There are four super-villains to 
destroy (a mad monk, a skeleton, a ghost, and Mr 
Grimreaper), and you must find the right objects 
to do this.

Cyrus T. Gross has built the TALOS asteroid and 
directed it towards earth. Only the Nemesis 
Organisation's Mobile Attack Droid 471 can save 
humanity now. 
 
In N.O.M.A.D., players take control of the Mobile 
Attack Droid 471 as it ventures through the city, 
in this top-view shooter. Players begin with four 
lives. The Droid moves with considerable inertia 
(although some rooms disable this), and control 
involves using left and right to rotate it, 
pushing forward to provide thrust in the direction 
it is facing, and pushing backwards to reverse. 
 
The early part of the route is linear, but later 
on there are junctions to plan around. Moving 
enemies, spawning points and wall-mounted guns are 
the main threats. There are many switches along 
the walls, which open the sealed doors located 
throughout the levels, although a switch doesn't

The planet Nonterraqueous is controlled by a 
master computer. You control a robot seeker drone 
trying to find and destroy this machine. 
 
You start with a laser and can get bombs but at 
swap stations you can change form. This new form 
cannot drop bombs or shoot lasers but it is not 
harmed by acid drops. You also have psyche 
stations that can reload you psyche but be 
careful. If you overload it you will be destroyed. 
 
You don't HAVE to change form for the acid drops. 
If you're quick and lucky enough, you can just 
avoid them. 
 
If you touch a proton thruster, an acid drop 
touches you in your acid vulnerable form, you 
overload you psyche, your psyche goes to zero or 
you're too low when you drop a bomb, you die.

Nosferatu the Vampyre (c) 1986 Design Design / 
Piranha 
 
This game shares two major similarities to The 
Great Escape - firstly, it's licensed around a 
venerable film, using the setting to new effect. 
Secondly, it's isometrically-viewed (with 
monochrome graphics, even on the 
capable-of-far-better C64) and features full 
object interaction of the Filmation style - this 
is taken further here, as the physics of the 
objects are varied by their shape and centre of 
gravity. 
 
There are three stages to complete. In the first 
you play Johnathan Harker, who must retrieve some 
papers (he works for an Estate Agent's) and escape 
the castle. The second level introduces 
Johnathan's wife Lucy, and van Helsing, with play 
switching between the three. Lucy's role is 
slightly different as it is she who pursues the 
vampire itself, and she takes on the task alone in 
level 3. 
 
Food must be collected to keep the characters' 
strength up, and crucifixes and candles can be 
picked up to help matters.

You find yourself in a world where the air has 
become unbreathable and Sun's light barely reaches 
planet Earth. With your planet almost desertic, 
many cities began to be built in other planets of 
the solar system. But... in Oberon, the fourth 
satellite, there appeared an strange life form, 
which did just awake from its lethargy. The worst 
of all is that these new creatures have started 
attacking the human populations, even if they are 
babies! 
 
Without wasting any more second, you decide to go 
to Oberon to save the few babies still alive, 
before they are eaten by these monsters. Once 
there, your mission would be to find the babies 
and send them to planet Earth in a safe way. For 
this, you will have to buy a cryogenic valve for 
each one of them in the ATMs of the Company, in 
order to provide them more safe travel. When you 
finish the mission, you will have to buy a ticket 
back to Earth. 
 
Oberon 69 is an arcade platformer where you will 
have to use your pistol to kill larvae, tentacles, 
robots, alien queens and her eggs, with the 
advantage that you can make frontal or vertical 
shots.

The game is set on Christmas Eve, with Santa

After the player enters his/her name (which is

first level takes the form of a flip-screen 
collecting game with Santa at home gathering the 
scattered pieces of his sleigh. If he collides 
with one of the elves running around, the item he 
is carrying is lost and has to be found again. 
 
The player chooses six presents they want 
(computer, doll, book, etc.), which are listed on 
their letter to Santa. Santa then collects the 
presents as they fall from the top of the screen. 
 
Finally Santa can deliver the presents, riding his 
sleigh over several horizontally-scrolling 
continents. The presents are dropped with 
parachutes and should be delivered to the homes 
indicated by arrows. Clouds and aeroplanes can 
knock them off course.

points as possible by passing the animal with the 
best arts. Players will also have the possibility 
to take off the "capote" (cloth) in order to run 
faster and distract the beast in one of those 
moments of maximum danger. But in case the bull 
does attack, no problem, the player just has to

Operation Thunderbolt (c) 1990 Taito Corporation /

Operation Thunderbolt is the exciting sequel to 
Operation Wolf. An airliner is hijacked by 
terrorists en-route from Paris to Boston, who 
threaten to kill all hostages on board if their 
mates aren't released from jail. Instead of 
reaching its destination, the airliner makes a 
landing in Kalubya, Africa, and all the hostages 
are hidden in various locations. The authorities 
have asked the hero from Operation Wolf to rescue 
the hostages, but only this time, the hero brings 
his friend along for the ride. 
 
There are eight missions to complete in Operation 
Thunderbolt, and each one has you shooting down 
soldiers, choppers, and tanks. The gameplay varies 
every one or two missions. In some missions, you 
are driving a jeep or controlling a boat, while in 
others, you are walking while you're shooting. You 
have a limited supply of ammo, and a limited 
supply of rocket bombs, but you can always stock 
up by shooting down crates falling from the sky, 
or by killing a cat or dog that get in the line of 
fire. Also from crates, you can get special items 
like bulletproof vests, rocket bombs, and 
different weapons. 
 
You also have a life bar to worry about. If you're 
shot at by soldiers, or if rocket bombs or 
grenades are thrown at you, you 'll lose energy, 
and once you're energy is depleted,  you lose one 
of your three lives. You can lose a lot of energy 
by killing hostages on purpose,  and you can't 
easily avoid killing them if you decide to use 
rocket bombs to wipe out enemies. The eighth 
mission, the mission that involves you fighting 
terrorists on a plane,  proves to be difficult 
because a woman in a blue dress stands up and gets 
in the line of fire, and you have to very careful 
when you're going to use rocket bombs. 
 
There are two endings to this game, and which 
ending you can watch will depend on the number of 
hostages you've saved, and whether or not you shot 
the pilot instead of the mission eight boss.

You have been recruited for Operation Wolf, a

a variety of enemies, from soldiers to ninjas, 
patrol boats to helicopters, and more. Can you 
carry the day? 
 
Operation Wolf is an arcade conversion of the game 
by Taito. It is essentially a bitmapped 
"rail-shooter", where you basically hold the gun 
and shoot just about everything that moves, while 
conserving your ammo and grenades. Shoot 
ammo/grenades and healing items on the screen to 
"pick them up". Your primary machine gun can kill 
everything if you hit it enough times, but you can 
also use the grenade launcher for really deadly 
targets like helicopters or armored cars. You can 
collect a machine gun which will allow you to 
shoot faster for a few seconds. 
 
You'll be pummelled by a LOT of enemies. Some will 
be shooting, others will be tossing grenades, 
knifes, and more. Some are armored and requires 
more than a few hits, others dodges. You can shoot 
grenades and knifes out of the air if you aim well 
enough. There are also civilians running around 
which can be shot, but it's not beneficial. 
 
Bosses appear at the end of some levels, and each 
has a specific weakness you need to exploit.

car using its turbo-compressor, lost control and 
crashed into a truck. You survived, but just 
barely. You had fallen into a coma. During three 
years your soul was trapped in a strange place 
known as the Inferno. 
 
In this game the object is to escape the Inferno. 
You must explore, interact with characters, as 
well as collect and use inventory items. Above 
all, you must not fall into Satan's hands.

Outboard (c) 1990 Loriciel SA / Loriciel SA 
 
You as speedboat racer enters the championship 
taking place along the waterways of six cities 
(Paris, Venice, Amsterdam, London, New York, and 
Sydney). Kissed by a lovely woman and wearing the 
helmet, you should win the race accelerating and 
avoiding other competitors to do not crash into 
them or the debris in the water. In each waterway 
you must complete six laps, and at each end of the 
course, there are buoys which you must approach 
slowly in order to turn around. The other 
competitors are ill-mannered, regularly get in 
your way and want to throw you off the speedboat, 
so you often has to teach them a lesson of 
courtesy.

post-apocalyptic universe in which a lot of money 
can be earned by transporting goods form place to 
place, but the large gangs of Overlanders who 
already do this are keen to stop you. 
 
Two missions are on offer at a time, one tougher 
but more lucrative than the other, with half the 
money paid upfront and the other half on 
successful completion. Before setting off, you can 
buy upgrades such as turbo chargers, armour and 
enhanced weapons, each of which has a limited 
lifespan. Attacks from other vehicles can come 
either from guns or attempting ramming, and the 
roads are poorly-maintained and hazardous, so be 
careful, or better yet be violent first.

As a diver you explore the calm waters of the 
Pacific in a search of hidden treasures. Starting 
at the waves you dive deeper and deeper to the 
reefs, which form a labyrinth and block your way. 
During the diving you should move left/right, swim 
up or passively fall down on the screen until you 
reach its boundary, when you progress from one 
screen to another. 
Underwater inhabitants such as crabs or skates are 
harmful to your diving-suit so you have to shoot 
them with your pistol. You also have to push the 
dynamite to the seabed, find the doors, follow the 
passages, and collect the treasures. Encountering 
the depth sensors in the reefs you may check your 
position on the map. Your oxygen supply is 
exhausting during a diving so you have to top it 
up regularly. 
 
Game may be played in turns by 1 or 2 players of 
the same or different sex.

   arms, face, and legs, Pac must guide a fairy 
   back to her home in Fairy Land, but this task 
   will not be easy because Inky, Blinky, Pinky, 
   Clyde, and Sue will pursue Pac-Man as he

   his family: Ms. Pac-Man, Baby Pac-Man, Chomp 
   Chomp, and Sourpuss. 
 
There are sixteen rounds to complete, with four 
trips each. During each round, he can grab a power 
pellet, which cause ghosts to turn blue, allowing 
Pac-Man to eat them for points. Points are also 
awarded by collecting fruit that appear, like 
cherries and strawberries. In some rounds, Pac 
must use a springboard to jump over a lake. He 
must also make it to the end of each round before 
time runs out, otherwise a ghost will chase him.

Pang is a platform game which consists of 50 
levels in total. It can be played with one or two 
players on the same screen, and the other player 
can join anytime within the game. 
 
Your goal is to destroy the balloons which bounce 
around the playfield. To accomplish this, you can 
shoot hooks which travel upwards, and blow up any 
balloon they touch. Depending on their size, they 
either split on two smaller ones, or evaporate if 
they're at their minimum size. Apart from 
balloons, some levels also have barriers that have 
to be destroyed with your hooks, since they often 
block your access to balloons. There are also some 
barriers which cannot ever be destroyed. Your 
character has the ability to climb ladders, but 
cannot jump. 
 
You can also pick up power-ups such as: the 
ability to fire two shots at once, the hook that 
attaches to the ceiling and waits 'til something 
bumps into it, a gun which has a high rate of fire 
but cannot destroy barriers. Beside extra weapons, 
you can also pick certain things like clock 
(halting time for a small period), dynamite 
(reducing all balls to minimum size, thus making 
you able to reach more points), life, and such.

Panzadrome (c) 1985 RamJam Corporation, The / 
Ariolasoft UK 
 
As the pilot of an underpowered tank with stone 
wheels and a single-shot turret, you must take out 
the full force of tanks which inhabit the island 
of Panzadrome, which is split into 64 flick-screen 
regions. Nothing unusual there, but the tanks and 
mounted turrets of Panzadrome are robotic, and 
controlled by a central computer. Plasma vents 
send their power throughout the network, and are 
destructible but heavily protected by tanks – 
these are thus your main target. 
 
Upgrades to your tank can be purchased from robot 
factories, each of which offers a single product. 
The most important of these is the Polycrete, 
which allows you to repair the huge impassable 
craters that are left in the ground by enemy fire. 
This adds a puzzle element to the game, as you aim 
to kill tanks in wide areas where possible, to 
prevent boxing yourself in. Keep an eye on the 
scanner in order to avoid landmines, and don’t 
allow your shields to be destroyed.

always very reasonable, given the player's meagre 
starting wallet, motivating players to earn higher

There are three different stages: one in Europe,

Park Patrol (c) 1986 Activision, Inc. / Firebird 
Software Ltd. 
 
Do you have what it takes to become a park ranger? 
This game will test you to see if you're really up 
to the job. You play a park ranger, whose job is 
to collect twelve items scattered around the park, 
such as soda cans, bottles, and balls. 
Unfortunately, getting these items is not as easy 
as it sounds, as your task gets difficult by 
swimmers, swamps, snakes, turtles, and ants. To 
make matters worse, your energy gets depleted 
quickly, so to restore it, you can either return 
to your hut, or snatch food off an ant's back in 
later levels. More often than not, some of the 
turtles will follow you into the lake. If they 
enter the lake, you can run them over for 500 
points before they decide to jump back out again. 
 
Besides collecting items, you also must rescue 
swimmers that are about to drown in the lake. Fail 
to rescue a swimmer in a limited amount of time, 
and you'll also drown, and the same can be said if 
you bump into snakes. Rather than collecting 
items, you  can also roll on logs. Doing this will 
earn you 5000 points if you manage to roll for a 
long time. There are five levels of Park Patrol to 
complete, and once you complete all of them, the 
diffculty level gets higher and the game becomes 
much more difficult. To give you an example, the 
turtles will stop at nothing to kill you, and 
there will be more than one swimmer to rescue at 
once. 
 
This game can have two players. Park Patrol even 
provides you with a menu, in which you can alter 
the number of turtles, ants, swamps, swimmers, and 
snakes in each of the five levels. With the menu, 
you can have none of these in every level, but 
what's the fun of completing a level without any 
enemies to avoid? Also, you can play as a boy or a 
girl.

The aim of this interactive fiction with graphics

strange occurrences are routine. The Roobikyoub 
dwarves have been banished from the kingdom, which 
is not good as they produce high-quality whisky. 
King Erik is not popular for this decision, as 
some feel that ale brewers and mineral water 
bottlers have influenced him. Honest John the 
trader and Kronos the Magician play a key role in 
your journey, each offering sub-quests to attempt. 
 
The package includes a novella complete with map 
and decipherable hints, which are accessed by 
typing 'hint' followed by the code into the

upper left coordinate of the battlefield and 'o15' 
means the lower right coordinate of the 
battlefield. Five kinds of ships (1-5 items in 
line) and the radar are present to easy the job of 
the ships detection. Accurate hits increase your 
score.

Rather than attempting to simulate the whole of 
football, this title concentrated on the 
goalkeeper's task of saving shots. In each match 
you will face a succession of shots from different 
distances and angles, and aim to save as many as 
possible. 16 teams were included for you to select 
your team and opposition from. There's a practice 
mode, and a skill challenge, where you move up 
through the game by saving 4 successive shots. The 
C64 version has a little sampled speech and extra

PHM Pegasus is a combination simulation and action 
game. You control a naval hydrofoil missile boat, 
and need to complete a variety of different 
missions. Some of the missions include destroying 
all enemy vessels in a given area, surveillance 
requiring you to identify the location of enemy 
ships (without sinking them!), or to escort a 
supply ship through hostile territory. As missions 
are successfully completed you earn points based 
on how successful the mission was, and with 
increasing points you can advance in rank, from 
deck mopper up to admiral. Your performance on one 
mission won't have an affect on future ones, and 
you can choose to play missions out of order as 
well.  Several missions include other craft you 
can control to help out (both ships and 
helicopters). A time compression mode is included, 
which can be used to reduce the amount of time 
waiting to arrive at a destination, or even left 
on to make the action sequences more challenging.

From Konami's coin-op, Ping Pong recreates the 
fast-paced sport of table tennis. To win each 
match you must get to 10 points with a 2 point 
lead - if the scores reach 10-9 the game goes on 
until someone has a 2 point lead or reaches 15, in 
a similar manner to tennis. There are nine skill 
levels to beat, with increasing abilities as the 
game goes on. The human player has the advantage 
of serving first, and as the serve reverses every 
five points, you are guaranteed to have more 
chances to serve than your opponent (remember the 
significance of 10 and 15 in the scoring). The 
points system rewards long rallies and large 
winning margins, as you get points for each hit, 
for each point won, and for each point of the 
winning margin.

Pipe Mania (c) 1990 Assembly Line, The / Empire 
Software 
 
Each level of this abstract puzzler challenges the 
player to set up a network of pipes to allow an 
unspecified substance known as 'flooz' to flow 
through as many of those as possible. The pieces 
are offered in random order, and there are seven 
different types - straight lines going 
horizontally or vertically, corners rotating in 
each of the four directions, and cross-over pieces 
which carry the flooz straight across horizontally 
and vertically. Each of these can be entered from 
either side. When the flooz hits a gap, or a piece 
which the previous piece can't flow into, the pipe 
is finished. 
 
Before the flooz starts flowing from its 
randomly-selected starting position, the player 
has several seconds to start placing pieces. They 
can be put down anywhere. However a situation that 
can often occur is there will be a long and 
complex piping arrangement set up, yet a gap 
somewhere remains to be filled. Players are able 
to  replace a piece with another in the same 
square (to make it easier to flow the flooz that 
way), but for a slight scoring penalty. 
 
Bonuses are awarded for looping the flooz through 
both sides of at least 5 cross-over pieces, or 
passing the flooz through every square on the 
screen. Later levels have some squares on the grid 
blocked off, a few gaps in the side-wall (allowing 
flooz to thread to the other side of the screen). 
After every four levels there is a bonus game for 
points, in which the player can only place the 
pieces in the lowest open space in each column, 
similarly to the board game of "Connect 4".

Platoon (c) 1988 Ocean Software Ltd. / Ocean

The film Platoon featured a squad of five soldiers 
on their mission for the US Army in Vietnam. In 
this action game based around the film, you take 
control of these five guys in turn, with the 
chance to switch between them as they each take 
one of the 3 hits that would kill them. 
 
The game recreates each of the sections of the 
film, starting with a side-scrolling journey 
through the jungle, with paths to cross both 
horizontally and vertically, and the ability to 
jump or duck hazards. You will need to blow up a 
bridge and then locate a village, which contains a 
torch, a map and a trap-door. The enemy has 
booby-trapped the area and are launching 
airstrikes, so the danger is not all from enemy 
ground soldiers. 
 
The next section is in first-person 3D, as you 
move through a network of tunnels in search of 
flares and a compass. There are 3 distinct control 
methods, changing from the standard motion when an 
enemy appears (this puts you in control of a 
cross-hair for more accurate targeting), and when 
you enter a room to search. 
 
After escaping this you settle in a bunker 
overnight, and have a limited amount of flares 
with which to locate incoming enemy, and must then 
shoot them before they can shoot you. The jungle 
airstrike from the film is the next moment - you 
have two minutes to rush into a safe position to 
the north, using your compass for guidance. 
 
Finally you face the treacherous Sergeant Barnes, 
and must hit him with grenades 5 times whilst 
trapped in a foxhole to prevent him wiping you 
out.

Poli Diaz Boxeo (c) 1990 Opera Soft S.A. / Opera 
Soft S.A. 
 
Poli Diaz is a boxing game protagonized by the 
Spanish boxing star of the late eighties, 
Policarpio Díaz. This game uses an isometric 
perspective where two boxers revolve around the 
center of the ring, with no possibility of going 
back, and we observe it from a corner of the 
quadrilateral. The options menu is the usual: one 
or two player mode, choose the control type and 
the number of assaults and lenght of the same. 
 
Our first opponent will be a sparring, that 
without offering much opposition, will allow us to 
learn about the control of the game. After this 
weak opponent is defeated, you will have to fight 
(in order) for the titles of Spain, Europe and the 
World against other opponents. 
 
"Poli Diaz" has two different modes of control, 
one of attack and other of defence. In the former, 
and with the appropriate combination of hits and 
movement, we will attack the contrary, and in the 
second we will cover of the  punches that 
undoubtedly fall over us. In this context, using a 
joystick could be recommendable.

Popeye 2 (c) 1991 Bizarre Developments /

Strange happenings are afoot once again in 
Sweethaven and only Popeye can make it right. In 
Popeye 2, our spinach lovin' hero must once again 
rescue Olive Oyl and make mincemeat of Bluto while 
looking after Swee'Pea, feeding Wimpy and keeping 
an eye on Jeep. 
 
Popeye has four different levels to traverse 
through. His initial adventure takes him to a 
construction site where bouncing springs, falling 
girders and open welding flames impede his 
progress. Rolling barrels, and bombs which must be 
touched to be put out also stand to cause harm. In 
every level scattered hamburgers must be collected 
in order for Popeye to get past Wimpy who is often 
hanging out somewhere near the top of every 
vertically scrolling platform level. There are 
also feats of strength that Popeye must perform by 
beating up a punching robot-type thing with the 
aid of Spinach. Once past all these obstacles 
Popeye can move on to the next level. 
 
The second level takes Popeye into the urban 
jungle where he must climb the side of the Biff 
Spinach building and avoid the same obstacles as 
in the previous levels. In the third level falling 
girders are replaced with giant bananas as Popeye 
finds himself in a jungle. Coconut throwing 
monkeys hang from ledges and snoozing tigers and 
snakes decorate the trees. The fourth and final 
level of the game finds Popeye climbing the masts 
of the S.S. Trev and the S.S. Andy as he makes his 
way to a final confrontation with Bluto and rescue 
Olive Oyl. 
 
Popeye is able to jump around and occasionally 
when the situation calls for it punch his way 
through this vertical platformer. Bonus points are 
rewarded for finding Swee'Pea and Jeep. He can 
take multiple hits before he takes a curtain call 
but thankfully is unharmed by long drops. The 
player should beware as Popeye has only one life 
to get through the four levels of this adventure.

Postman Pat's rounds for this morning take him 
through the streets to several different houses, 
all indicated by black arrows. Unfortunately, his 
van has broken down, so he must do his rounds on 
foot. The first job is to find a collect the pile 
of letters. Watch out for stray hens. Make sure to 
drink plenty of tea to ensure that he is up to the 
tasks. 
 
That is not all he must do though - being a pillar 
of the community he is always prepared to help out 
when his friends need a favour. These may involve 
collecting and using objects (only one can be 
carried at a time), or finding other people such 
as Ted Glenn the handyman. A top-down map guides 
you as you complete each task.

Mankind has spread throughout the solar system 
into vast colonies, which are under alien threat. 
The bad guys have anti-matter machines capable of 
destroying the planets' power source. You must 
destroy these before they can reach Critical Mass. 
 
Your journey involves travelling primarily to the 
east, in a hovering craft. It is rotated with left 
and right movements, and accelerated with forward 
motion. Laser and shield strength are limited and 
monitored on screen. Use them wisely, as hostile 
aliens and mines line the route. Get shot down and 
you re-emerge with a jet pack, now directed to the 
bay which can give you a new craft. 
 
The force-field gates near the power planets are 
guarded by turrets which must be shot down. The 
mission then boils down the insides of the plant, 
which must be destroyed before its tractor beam 
has sucked you into the core.

continue to the next stage. Be careful not to bump 
into other buggies or objects next to the road. 
While you’re buggy can take a pounding, crashing 
will slow you down.

As one of the four great Gods Apollo, Hermes, 
Hecate and Aphrodite, choose a team of four mighty 
warriors to fight for you in the Powerplay 
tournament to prove who is the greatest. This 
battle will be fought out not using swords or 
knives, but with knowledge - gameplay takes the 
form of a complex quiz on a chess-like board. 
 
You have four playing pieces, which start off 
arranged as a cross in one corner of the 
isometrically-viewed board. The squares are split 
into four different colours, which each represent 
a particular broad Trivial Pursuit-style subject 
area. The question has four possible answers, and 
a correct answer allows you to move your piece one 
space, perhaps onto one of the four white teleport 
squares (which randomly places it on one of those 
four squares). 
 
When a piece lands on the same square as an 
opposition piece, a challenge ensues, which plays 
out like a quiz show, with questions asks in quick 
fire and the first player to answer gaining a 
point if right and losing one if wrong. The losing 
piece drops down a skill level. 
 
Once a piece reaches 25 Wisdom Points, it can 
mutate up a skill level - this makes it harder to 
beat, but makes the questions it faces harder.

Prehistorik is a side-view platform game with 
superficial similarity to Chuck Rock, although the 
games were developed simultaneously in different 
countries. You control a neanderthal who must 
march through hostile pre-historic environments 
seeking food and keeping himself safe. Some food 
can be found in caves, but it mainly exists in 
living animal forms. 
 
These include fire-breathing Pyro-Tax dragons, the 
Turtosaurus, and the Bad Bat. Each of these must 
be clubbed to death, some taking up to 5 hits, and 
then walked over. Some other enemies are 
indestructible, with the monkeys who throw 
coconuts at you particularly fiendish. 
 
You will have to complete the level within the 
time limit, and avoid contact with these foes. 
However, bombs and improved weapons can be 
collected, as can extra lives, time bonuses and an 
improved jump.

Prehistorik 2 takes up the story of its

The hero must use his club to crush animal 
enemies, many of which then release bonus items to 
collect. He no longer needs to feed his clan, so 
there is no required minimum food target, unlike 
the original game. Other bonus items are located 
around the levels, while yet more can be found by 
using your club creatively and adventurously. 
 
There are bosses and passwords after every few 
levels. The Amstrad version is one of the few 
games to use the CPC Plus features for lots of 
colours and sprites and full parallax scrolling.

you have to shoot gangsters in a room, with no

If this 'simulator' is to be believed, powerboat 
racing is a chaotic race across a number of 
largely one-directional tracks with fjords and 
inlets forcing you down one of two lanes, and 
sections where a bridge needs to be cleared by 
hitting a ramp at the right speed beforehand (as 
you jump over these, you can land so as to skim 
off other boats). Your boat is fitted with bombs, 
which can be placed so as to force the other boats 
to run over them, gaining you points. Extra bombs 
and fuel litter the course, often close to the 
banks, which you must avoid contact with, for fear 
of crashing your boat. When this happens you are 
forced into the next one, which is, as if by 
magic, available at a convenient point just 
beforehand. A helicopter flies overhead, dropping 
bombs which you must avoid, and often obscuring 
your view. The other boats often crowd together 
attempting to force you into the wall. 
 
As with all the Codemasters budget titles, realism 
goes out of the window, with an emphasis on simple 
instantaneous action.

Psyborg (c) 1992 Loriciel SA / Loriciel SA 
 
You are a psyborg named Duncan Norton, who must 
travel through the vortex from a space vessel 
trapped in a galaxy very far from Earth. An alien 
race is threatening to take over 38 planets and 
you've got to stop them. 
 
Starting from Anacreon, you will mentally pass 
through the Krypton, Kalgan, Zorgon, Terminus, 
Trantor, and finally Sol systems. Each stellar 
system has a certain number of planets, which you 
will traverse from one to another. 
 
The game is a first-person virtual reality race, 
where you run as fast as possible on the tiles 
that are formed in a pentagonal prism. At the 
starting point you accelerate, and then change the 
facets of the prism in order to avoid falling 
through the gaps. When the tile's path  spirals, 
you may decelerate your velocity. Time runs out, 
and you must refill your time meter by standing on 
tiles marked with a "T". Standing on certain tiles 
that are marked with shapes of different blinking 
colors will give you a different amount of points. 
Special actions, such as jumping from one part of 
prism to another as well as teleporting forward 
and back, may be performed. Save points are placed 
on the track but the number of prism facets may 
change during your run. 
 
Finishing the race to each planet will give you a 
password, which may be used later to start from 
this point. The best scores will be written in 
High Scores table. 
 
The game is available for 1 or 2 players.

The object of this game is to get rid of your 
opponents (pigs) by throwing bombs at them. When 
they are thrown, the bombs will count down from 
the number shown on the bomb, and explode when 
they reach zero. But they will explode immediately 
once they hit their target, regardless of the 
countdown. Items can be picked up along the way 
that will help you defeat opponents. One of them 
is a knapsack that allows you to carry more than 
one bomb at a time. After certain levels, a bonus 
game appears, and the object of this game is to 
attempt to kiss the lady pigs as they pop in and

Sequel to Athena, the 2d side-scroller which 
starred a "kawaii" version of the greek goddess 
Athena as she set out to find adventure in the 
mortal world. 
 
Changing her bikini for a Japanese schoolgirl 
uniform, Athena uses her new psychic powers (hence 
"psycho" soldier... erm... yep, anyway...) to 
clear a post-apocalyptic world of its mutant 
inhabitants with the help of her friend Kensu 
(thus allowing simultaneous 2 player gameplay). 
 
Gameplay consists of the usual run 'n jump fare 
typical of the genre with the added feature of a 
constantly scrolling background, which added to 
the many "option"-style power-ups and Athena's own 
psychic blasts make the game a strange 
shooter/platformer hybrid.

Puffy and his fortuitously-named girlfriend Puffyn

traps and surprises. Taking control of one or the 
other (Puffy is more powerful but Puffyn can move 
faster) you must find your way through. 
 
Puffy's Saga is an overhead view maze game that 
represents a cutesy variant of Gauntlet. Each of 
the 20 levels has a quota of dots to eat before 
the level is completed. These levels are inhabited 
by foes who surround you and reduce your energy on 
contact. Meat restores 100 energy points each time 
- this total can go beyond its starting level of 
500. You are armed with a gun, which not only 
kills foes but also turns many of them into edible 
energy-giving snacks. 
 
Keys must be collected and used to open doors. 
Magic Goms allow you to use a map or a fire-bolt. 
Other available bonuses include invincibility 
periods and teleporting.

Puzznic (c) 1990 Taito Corporation / Ocean 
Software Ltd. 
 
The challenge in each level of Puzznic is to 
maneuvre a selection of blocks into place so as to 
clear them all, by making them make contact with 
blocks of the same design. You control a 
cross-hair, which can move a block left or right, 
which can cause it to fall if there is no block 
under the space it would occupy. 
 
There are many complications in terms of solving 
the levels. Moving platforms meaning that you need 
to move a block at a particular time, or in 
particular order, to prevent them being blockaded. 
In some situations there are an odd number of a 
certain type of block - solving these requires 
positioning two of the blocks one space apart, 
such that a move will result in a piece making 
contact with 2 others, and immediately removing 
all 3. You will also encounter blocks positioned 
on platforms suspended in space and gaps in level 
arrangements meaning that a certain number of 
blocks must be in place to make a certain move 
possible (by forming a stack, for example) 
 
The game structure is slightly unusual, as after 
you complete each batch of four levels you get a 
choice of 2 sets of levels - you are progressing 
through an expanding matrix of levels, which means 
there are 2 sets on level 2, 3 on level 3, 4 on 
level 4, and so on. This means that there are a 
total of 220 screens in the game. Each screen is 
played against a time limit, and losing a level 
(either by running out of time, or by making a 
poor move and leaving an impossible position) 
loses one of your 3 lives.

Quadrel (c) 1991 
 
Quadrel is a puzzle game in which you must fill 
each piece of the selected layout with different 
colored paints, without painting two adjacent 
pieces the same color. 
 
At the beginning of a game, you can select the 
desired image or layout, as well as whether you 
wish to play with unlimited time or not. You can 
also select the "Imposed" game mode, in which the 
game points which piece you must fill next. Each 
layout has a set amount of paint available for 
use, in four different colors: red, green, blue 
and yellow. The amount of brush stokes left for 
each color is indicated on your palette. Some 
layouts have a large amount of a particular color 
and a very small amount of another, while other 
layouts have a more even amount of each color. The 
goal is to plan well from the start, so as to 
avoid running out of a particular color that will 
be needed to finish the layout. 
 
The game can be played in solitaire mode, against 
the computer, or against another human player on 
the same screen. There are no sound effects during 
gameplay, only music. If you manage to finish a 
layout, you can enter your name in a high score 
table.

world-wide run that took place on September 11, 
1988. Millions of people around the world joined 
the campaign to help children worldwide by 
fighting hunger, poverty, and disease. 
 
Players take on the role of Omar Khalifa, the 
legendary Sudanese athlete who has decided to 
participate. Starting from the El Mowheli relief 
camp in Sudan, he has limited time to raise a flag 
and light a flame in each of the six continents. 
Khalifa's journey has him pass famous landmarks 
such as the Statue of Liberty, the United Nations, 
the Leaning Tower of Pisa, Mt. Rushmore, the 
Sydney Opera House, the Colosseum, and the Eiffel 
Tower. There are multiple routes on each 
continent. 
 
Khalifa can pick up objects to help him reach 
places, but only one object can be carried at a 
time. He can also get an hourglass which will give 
him more time. The run is over when Khalifa runs 
out of time or when he comes into contact with 
dangers he must face.

As Tal, your job is to single-handedly clear out

heals him, and enables him to float. 
 
This means that the game has two distinct styles, 
with your character limited to jumping, and with 
only rocks (located around the screens) to throw. 
Once he finds the suit he can fly around the 
ledges, shoot the inbuilt Pulsar beam, and survive 
within the volcanic hideout the aliens have based 
themselves. You will need to recharge the suit at 
times, and also take it off to pass through tight

Raid Over Moscow (c) 1985 Access Software, Inc. / 
U.S. Gold Ltd. 
 
The USSR has launched a huge attack on the USA, 
and the only hope for the free world is for you 
(as leader of a US Squadron of fighters) to 
destroy their defense bases. This is done in a 
multi-stage action game with some similarities to 
the same developer's Beach Head. All the 
mini-games must be completed before the time limit 
on the bomb is expired. 
 
The first thing you will see is a missile being 
launched

Sequel to Bubble Bobble, Rainbow Islands sees Bub 
and Bob (in 2 player mode), who are now curiously 
small boys rather than dinosaurs, attempting to 
rid the Rainbow Islands of bad guys. 
 
Using the power to cast rainbows, trapping 
anything underneath, the boys must ascend 
vertically 4 levels each island, with a big, bad 
boss at the end of each. 
 
By trapping beasts under your rainbows, then 
jumping on them to break them you can collect 
seven different colored gems, and there are also 
power-ups for extra speed and rainbows.

Rally Cross (c) 1989 Enigma Variations Ltd. / Anco

Rallycross racing was once popular on the BBC, 
featuring super-modified cars racing against each 
other on tracks combining tarmac and gravel 
sections. Rally Cross Challenge sees Anco bring it 
to life in top-view Super Sprint style. 
 
There are six different circuits, and four cars in 
the game - 16-bit users with a Microdeal joystick 
adapter can have all four of these controlled by 
human players, other users are limited to 
2-player. Computer cars have varying personalities 
and abilities. You must finish in the top 3 to 
move on to the next race. 
 
The opportunity to upgrade your car comes after 
each race, with the points you earn from race 
results (4,2,1 for the top 3). There are six 
categories of upgrades - turbo, steering, 
traction, aerodynamics, repair time and brakes.

Rally Driver (c) 1986 Five Ways Software / Hill 
MacGibbon 
 
Rather than creating a pure arcade game, Five Ways 
aimed at creating a true simulation of rallying 
that also had educational value. As such, a full 
map of the area is provided, a degree of 
route-planning is required, with each road having 
its own properties. Some have a higher possible 
speed, some are more likely to flood when it 
rains, and some are prone to being closed. 
 
You can get information on current conditions (and 
avoid a 50-second penalty) by stopping at a 
checkpoint. The hazards featured in the game are 
unusual - spectators running onto the track and 
stray farm animals must be avoided, and a definite 
penalty is imposed for driving the wrong way down 
a road. The race is in three stages, and drivers 
are eliminated after each of the first 2.

R.A.M. is a side-scrolling action platformer

  game begins Fox has landed far away from his 
  objective and he needs to cross several areas

  rely on his assault rifle and his hand grenades, 
  but later on he can use stationary guns and even 
  vehicles. The vehicles need fuel, and their

Rambo - First Blood Part 2 (c) 1986 Platinum 
Productions / Ocean Software Ltd. 
 
Tough Vietnam veteran John Rambo is called back 
into action after some soldiers are taken hostage 
in a PoW camp. His orders are to simply capture 
photographic evidence of the war crimes taking 
place, but after finding a close friend tied up, 
he decides to wipe them all out by himself. This 
being Hollywood, chances are that he will succeed. 
 
Ocean's interpretation of his challenge recreates 
Commando fairly closely. You move up the screen, 
taking out enemies – these respawn, so there is no 
value in not moving upwards as quickly as 
possible. Find strategic positions from which to 
attack. Touch each hostage you find to free them. 
 
You have knives and grenades, but using the latter 
alerts the enemy as to your presence, making life 
harder. Extra weapons such as rocket launchers and 
machine guns can be collected en route.

Rambo 3 (c) 1988 Ocean Software Ltd. / Ocean 
Software Ltd. 
 
Rambo's mission is set deep in Afghanistan, in the 
days when the Soviets occupied it, and America was 
putting this right (we won't mention who they 
enlisted to do so). Colonel Trautman has been 
kidnapped by the Soviets, and you've gone in there 
to rescuing him. Doing so is a three-part 
operation approximately following the plot of the 
film. 
 
In the first part, you explore the building 
Trautman could be in, through a top-down view of 
the building. It is heavily protected by infra-red 
security beams, which when activated unleadsh the 
enemies. The locations of the beams are only 
apparent if you collect the special goggles. Other 
hazards include mines, trapdoors and booby-trapped 
doors, but there are enhanced weapons to collect. 
 
Section two is identical to the first, except that 
it is located outside, the enemy are onto you from 
the start, and there are no traps. The final 
section changes to an Operation Wolf-style shoot 
'em up, with a horde of tanks, foot soldiers and 
helicopters to face. Your gun can jam, which adds 
to the challenge of finally getting out alive.

Ramparts (c) 1988 Future Concepts Ltd. / GO! 
 
Not to be confused with Atari Games' Rampart, 
Ramparts is in fact a clone of Bally Midways' 
Rampage, but with a medieval theme, and players 
are giant knights instead of monsters. The game is 
for one or two players simultaneously, and each 
has the opportunity to enter in a five-character 
name before play begins, which will subsequently 
be displayed next to individual scores during 
play. 
 
The game takes place on a single screen, where the 
player(s) can move left and right on one 
foreground plane, and the object is to destroy a 
castle, each phase, by scaling and punching the 
individual buildings until each, and all 
collapses. Buildings will often overlap, requiring 
some to be taken down before others. Players will 
be harassed by witches, goblins, archers and the 
like. 
 
The back story concerns two knights, Sir Griswold 
and Sir Larkin, who have had a curse set upon them 
to be transformed into giants by the Evil One, and 
they must quest for the fiend, so that they may be 
restored to mere mortals.

Ranarama (c) 1987 Graftgold Ltd. / Hewson 
Consultants Ltd. 
 
The purpose of apprentice courses is for young 
people to learn a trade gradually, without putting 
yourself or your employers at risk. Unfortunately, 
nobody explained this to Wizard’s apprentice 
Mervyn, before he tried to cast a spell to make 
him irresistible to females, as the spell 
misfired, and made him attractive only to female 
frogs. However, his dungeon was soon invaded, and 
Mervyn was not killed, as he appeared to be a 
humble frog. 
 
Viewed from above, the aim is to kill all 96 of 
the wizards who have invaded the dungeon, which is 
split into 8 levels, each made up of 16 screens 
and at least 50 rooms. To see what’s in a room he 
has to enter it, in a manner similar to the 
Switchblade games. 
 
The game’s rather esoteric title comes from the 
way you obtain spells to upgrade the four 
different types of power you have (power, offence, 
defence and effect). When you meet a warlock you 
enter a mini game in which the letters RANARAMA 
are in random order, and by swapping pairs of 
letters in sequence you must form the full word in 
as little time as possible. This system of having 
a sub-game for collecting upgrades is similar to 
the ‘grappling’ concept in Paradroid. 
 
This earns up to four of the Runes (Mysticism, 
Witchcraft, Magecraft and Runecraft), each of 
which can be used on one of the four types of 
power. The Magecraft offensive use is a fireball, 
defence for Runecraft makes you invisible to 
enemies, and the special effect for Witchcraft 
allows you to jump through space. Lose a life and 
you lose all these powers, and losing another life 
means it’s Game Over.

Rebel Planet (c) 1986 Adventuresoft UK Ltd. / 
Adventuresoft UK Ltd. 
 
You play the part of an agent of SAROS, the Terran 
resistance movement against their imperial alien 
overlords, the Arcadians. Disguised as a merchant, 
you will fly your ship, the Caydia, to three 
different colony planets -- Tropos, Halmuris, and 
Arcadion -- to rendezvous with underground freedom 
fighters and gather the intelligence you require 
to destroy the central computer of the Arcadian 
hivemind, liberating humanity! 
 
An adaptation of Robin Waterfield's Fighting 
Fantasy gamebook #18, published the previous year, 
this computer game version rejects the 
Choose-Your-Own-Adventure gameplay design of the 
book in favour of a more open-ended text adventure 
model, albeit one with a restrictive text parser.  
Most elements of the trademark Fighting Fantasy 
RPG system, including the randomness of even 
simulated die-rolls, have been streamlined out, 
leaving only metrics for damage taken and hunger 
(hitherto untracked in the books.)  Carrying 
limits, while atypical in FF gamebooks, are 
enforced here as in the original book. 
 
A further new dynamic includes the strict 
timetable of the space traffic control towers -- 
you need to have wrapped up your business 
planetside before your launch window comes up, 
otherwise you're out of luck.  In keeping with the 
game's sci-fi setting (in both rural and urban 
flavours), you will find extensive use of objects 
such as your limcom, nutritious hcaps (tasty like 
dead Zorkons, num num!), and the indispensable 
lite-kube.  Combat has been largely phased out in 
favour of an extension of the gamebook's espionage 
theme of ciphers and passwords, magic words with 
the power of plot advancement. 
 
A version of this game also came out for the BBC 
Micro.

Red Heat - Double Detente (c) 1989 Special FX 
Software Ltd. / Ocean Software Ltd. 
 
Red Heat is based on the Walter Hill film of the 
same name, starring Arnold Schwarzenegger and 
James Belushi. You take control of Soviet 
detective Ivan Danko (played by Schwarzenegger), 
who travels to Chicago in pursuit of the fearsome 
Georgian drug lord Victor Rosta. 
 
The game is essentially a side-scrolling beat'em 
up in the vein of Vigilante. As Danko, you proceed 
across four levels which follow the movie's 
original setting, where you are constantly 
attacked by members of the Cleanheads, a group of 
drug-dealers who are in business with Victor 
Rosta. To eliminate hostiles you can either punch 
them (slow but long-ranged) or head-butt them 
(close-ranged but faster). The only defensive move 
available is crouching, so as to avoid being hit - 
there is no jumping or any other evasive tactics. 
Occasionally, you can get hold of a handgun and 
fire six shots at the villains. Other items you 
can pick up will boost your health, make you 
temporarily invulnerable or give you access to 
bonus levels. 
 
One peculiarity of Red Heat is its widescreen-like 
game area, and the fact that all characters are 
drawn from the waist up. This may find partial 
explanation in the first level, set in a Russian 
sauna where, as in the original movie scene, all 
characters are not wearing clothes.

Red Moon (c) 1985 Level 9 Computing, Ltd. / 
Rainbird Software 
 
The Red Moon Crystal is the only source of Magik 
in the land, and stabilizes the forces of the 
world. This crystal has been stolen and as a 
result, the land has fallen into chaos. A single 
powerful magician is sent to rescue the Crystal 
from the castle where it's hidden. 
 
Red Moon is an graphical interactive fiction game. 
Players assume the role of the wizard on his quest 
to recover the crystal. They will have the use of 
many weapons and a dozen magical spells. Combat is 
a key element of the game: both the magician and 
enemy opponents have hit points, in the style of 
RPGs. Spellcasting requires certain objects to be 
collected, and many spells must also be cast on a 
specific target. Various objects will be found 
during the adventure, including garlic, pills and 
a mask.

Renegade (c) 1987 Taito Corporation / Imagine 
 
This is the conversion of Taito's scrolling beat

Target: Renegade and Renegade III: The Final 
Chapter.  The game is set on the mean streets of 
Brooklyn, which you must venture through to meet 
your girlfriend, and then rescue her from her 
kidnappers. This is split into five levels, taking 
you through the subway and the docks as well as 
some inhospitable streets. A wide range of 
aggressive moves are on offer, including 
headbutts, kicks, punches and flying kicks. Much 
of the game's violence is depicted in a fairly 
tongue-in-cheek style, with an element of 
attempted humour along the way.

Renegade 3 - The Final Chapter (c) 1989 Imagine /

Renegade 3 was the third and last in the Imagine's 
series, based on the original coin-op by Taito. 
The hero's girlfriend has been beamed into the 
future, while the man himself has been sent back 
into prehistory. This sets the scene for a 
sideways scrolling arena combat game, where the 
player fights in various time periods. The 
settings varied from Egyptian and medieval, to a 
futuristic level. As such, gone are the attacks of 
street gangs from the first two iterations of the 
series, replaced by assailants such as knights in 
armor and robots. In each level you have six 
minutes to reach the finish, as this is all the 
time the time-travel portal is available for. 
There are many surface hazards to avoid, as well 
as multi-layered Green Beret-style areas. You can 
kick and punch at different heights, allowing you 
to deal with each of the diverse foes.

The advanced civilization of the planet Somerset 
built a gigantic exploratory spaceship called 
Atlantis, and sent it to research the planet 
Earth. After the completion of its task, the ship 
submerged to an oceanic abyss. The D.A.G. 
("giant-looking depredators"), a war-mongering 
civilization, took possession of Atlantis with the 
intention of conquering Somerset and the universe. 
Somerset sends a hero to rescue Atlantis from the 
enemy, and return it home. 
 
Rescue from Atlantis is a Spanish side-scrolling 
action-adventure game divided in three loads: 
 
1.  In the first load, the hero must find a way 
   to gain entrance to the camouflage city built 
   on top of Atlantis. This level starts with the 
   bathysphere being dropped from the sky into the 
   ocean by a spaceship. Once it hits the bottom, 
   the player can guide it by using O and P to 
   move left and right, respectively. Q makes it 
   go up, and A cycles through its inventory. The 
   bathysphere is armed with a laser gun that can 
   be fired by pressing the SPACE bar. Hitting M 
   ejects the protagonist from the bathysphere as 
   to explore more strait entrances. Once out, M 
   also serves as the GET, DROP, ENTER and USE 
   button. There are objects scattered on the sea 
   floor to be collected and used. The bathysphere 
   also comes with some useful paraphernalia: 
 
? A laser pistol to kill the enemy and the sea 
life

destroy them first. To defend yourself from these 
threats, your ship is equipped with torpedoes. As 
the levels progress, the Jaggi defenses become 
more aggressive, and you will even need to fly 
some night missions where visibility is limited!

Based on the overlooked but dark in tone 1985 Walt 
Disney movie Return To Oz which was a non-musical 
sequel to The Wizard Of Oz, this combined story 
elements from L. Frank Baum's novels Ozma Of Oz 
and The Marvelous Land Of Oz.  The game plot 
follows the movie pretty closely.  After returning 
to Kansas, no one believes Dorothy's story. When 
she can't sleep, Auntie Em seeks help from a

insane asylum. Dorothy escapes and finds herself 
back in the Land of Oz where she learns the Nome 
King has taken over and has destroyed the Emerald 
City and the Yellow Brick Road.  Your new 
companion is Billina the chicken who in Oz can 
talk.  You will meet a scarecrow named Jack 
Pumpkinhead, and a robot named Tik-Tok, among 
others.  Dorothy must stop the Nome King and the 
witch Mombi who wants Dorothy's head for her 
collection, and restore Princess Ozma to the 
throne. 
 
There is a command line at bottom of screen with 
the following options: Look, Talk, Search, Get, 
List, and Leave. List shows you all the items you 
are carrying and shows you a sub-menu to Drop or 
Use an item.  The top of the screen offers a text 
description of the graphics scene shown.  As the 
game is intended for kids, when you select a

ship and to build a shelter, then to adapt to 
day-to-day life on the island, which might not be 
entirely uninhabited... 
 
Getting around the game is dependent on carrying 
out the correct actions in the correct order, or 
Mother Nature and other forces will meddle, 
eventually leading to Robinson's unceremonious 
death. Since the game is close to the original 
story, a copy of Daniel Defoe's book will serve as 
a useful cheating guide.

RoboCop (c) 1989 Ocean Software Ltd. / Ocean 
Software Ltd. 
 
Patrolman Alex Murphy was killed on the streets of 
Detroit. The major corporation there, Omni 
Consumer Products (OCP) saw an opportunity to sell 
a new kind of law enforcement officer to the 
troubled city. They took what was left of Murphy, 
encased it in titanium armor, wiped his memory and 
created RoboCop. Now it's up to RoboCop to clean 
the streets of Detroit and eliminate the one 
responsible for his murder, Clarence Boddicker. 
But it looks like Clarence might not be the 
kingpin of this town... 
 
Based on the 1987 movie of the same name, RoboCop 
allows the player to control RoboCop. The majority 
of the game is a side scroller. RoboCop can punch 
unarmed citizens and shoot armed citizens. He can 
move left, right and duck but can not jump. 
Different weapons can be picked up from enemies, 
and power-ups to restore health and/or energy. 
Following levels, RoboCop will have to match a 
criminal's face to the proper mugshot and engage 
in a first-person shooting bonus round.

RoboCop 2 is a mission-based platform game. 
Missions have various objectives, such as 
destroying nukes or killing all the enemies. If 
you didn't destroy/kill enough, you'll be 
transported to a training mission, which is a 
first-person perspective shoot 'em up. Should you 
also fail the training, you must go to the

Rock 'n' Roll (c) 1989 Rainbow Arts Software GmbH

Rock 'n Roll is a real-time puzzle game. 
 
You know, there's this ball, and it's stuck in a 
labyrinth for no apparent reason. Never mind -- 
let's just help him out, okay? 
You control the friendly, spotted ball with the 
cursor keys. It'll gain speed as it goes, bounce 
off when it hits obstacles, loose energy when it's 
caught in traps, die when it falls off the 
platform. The 32 levels through which you've got 
to guide the ball are full of traps: laser 
barriers, ramps, tubes, breakable tiles etc. 
Colored keys will open doors, switches create (or 
destroy!) helpful items. These include picks to 
repair floor tiles, parachutes to prevent you from 
falling off and bombs to destroy walls. Items have 
to be bought with coins that are found all over 
the level. 
The inertia of the ball has a very realistic feel 
to it, making the control intuitive and relatively 
easy. Not so easy, however, is the design of the 
(huge) levels

Rockstar Ate My Hamster (c) 1989 Codemasters / 
Codemasters 
 
You are Cecil Pitt, a wannabe rock star manager. 
You must choose from 1-4 rock stars (with names 
such as Tina Turnoff and Wacko Jacko) to manage by 
viewing their audition tapes. Once you chosen your 
artists you then have to choose what kind of gear 
to get them - spanking new, second hand or dodgy. 
The dodgy gear is dirt cheap but you might pay for 
your choice later on in the game. 
 
To make your group a star, you have options such 
as practicing, publicity stunts, and buying gifts 
for your stars. Each action you choose advances 
the calendar by one day and you have until 
December to achieve your ultimate aim of 
superstardom - represented by a line graph which 
rises or falls depending on the performance of 
your band's releases. 
 
Once your band has recorded their first album you 
can choose to release the single and/or the album. 
The single needs a video to go with it which costs 
varying amounts of cash depending on which 
director you choose. You can choose to go for 
publicity, but this can be risky as there is a 
chance that one of your rock stars will be in the 
papers as an ex-rock star who died in any of many 
strange ways (all that's missing is a 'bizarre 
gardening accident'). Publicity affects your sales 
directly and also affects the crowds who attend 
your gigs. You lose the game if either you run out 
of money, or all of your rock stars die.

Taking a rather literal view of the term 
'slap-stick humour', Rodland features two fairies 
called Tam and Rit, whose mission is to rescue 
their mum who's been captured and taken to a 
castle. 
 
There are 40 screens to clear, all full of 
baddies, who are disposed of by grabbing them with 
a stick, and flipping them from side to side to 
inflict damage. The hits needn't all be inflicted 
at the same time, as it's possible to release them 
to move them out of the way. 
 
When killed, each bad guy releases some kind of 
extra, ranging from points bonuses to various 
devices which can be used to kill other enemies. 
 
Each level also contains a certain amount of 
fruit. If you can collect all of this (with some 
bad guys still alive - you move on immediately 
once they're gone) you enter a bonus game, in 
which each enemy's death results in one of the 
letters E,X,T,R and A being released - collect 
them all for an invaluable extra life. 
 
In the Game Boy version the difficulty lies 
slightly lower because the player can use his wand 
even when climbing ladders.

as the game goes on. 
 
There are pre-programmed moving enemies on each 
level to plan around, but the level's blocks vary 
in many ways. There are holes on the levels, but 
these can be jumped by pressing fire. You can turn 
plain squares into either crosses or holes, both 
of which invert the status of the crosses and 
holes respectively as well. Mystery squares (whose 
effect can be good or bad) and clock squares 
(which stop the timing and slow the aliens) are

R-Type (c) 1989 Irem Corp. / Electric Dreams 
  Software 
 
R-Type is a side scrolling shoot 'em up best 
  known for its extremely tough and strategic 
  gameplay.  You control the R-9 spaceship as it 
  launches a last-ditch effort to repel the evil 
  Bydo empire. 
 
The R-9 comes equipped as standard with a small 
gun which can only take down the smallest of 
enemies without firing several shots. By holding 
down the fire button, it can be loaded up so as to 
release a large burst of energy, eliminating all 
but the strongest enemies in its path. From time 
to time, pods will come flying in your direction. 
Upon being shot, they release an upgrade. The 
first one will invariably be the one called "The 
Force", which is a weapons pod that clings either 
to the front or the back of your ship, absorbing 
any enemy bullets or acting as a bumper with which 
you can fly head-on into them. You can also use it 
as an offensive weapon by firing it and pulling it 
back in. Mastering the Force is vital to surviving 
in R-Type, since it must be used both as 
protection against bullet clusters, as a remote 
controlled cannon, and in order to clear the 
screen from obstacles. Other upgrades give you 
target-seeking missiles or a bigger main gun. 
Different gun types, differentiated by their 
colour, serve different purposes. The blue one 
sends laser beams bouncing across the screen (good 
for tunnels), the red one fires straight ahead, 
and the yellow one follows any walls it may 
encounter (good for artillery emplacements). 
 
The stages of R-Type are made in an organic style, 
certainly inspired by H. R. Giger's artwork for 
the Alien movies. When it came out, it was 
considered trend-setting since it broke off from 
the stereotypical sci-fi mould of other 
shoot'em'ups. In part, the levels themselves are 
your enemy, which is exemplified by the fourth, 
where spider-like creatures weave webs that cover 
the screen and block your path, or levels with 
intricate tunnel systems. Still, the levels are 
best handled with a combination of strategy and 
reflexes, without the memorisation that is 
required of R-Type's contemporary rival, Gradius.

The Rubicon Alliance (c) 1987 Ariolasoft UK / 
Reaktor Software 
 
In this intergalactic 3D action-flight-simulation 
your mission is to save the Rubicon, an 
constructed anti-matter zone that was made by the 
alliance of the eight planets of the Hyturian 
system. In 2746 after many centuries of war 
between the eight planets of the system, they 
decided to build up this anti-matter zone around 
the entire system as protection against each 
others. It worked fine for several decades - the 
peace remained unthreatened. But now the time has 
come that the Rubicon barrier has been breached, 
by the entry of a new planet and its hostile home 
race, the Space Thugs. Enter your Starfox fighter, 
save the whole system, and find out who breached 
the system. 
 
The action is viewed from the cockpit of your 
starfighter, which is equipped with lasers and 
side/rear-view mirrors. It also has a status log 
detailing your weapons and current threats, and an 
advanced 3-dimensional navigation system called 
the Holocube. Controlled from a separate screen, 
the Holocube allows you to rotate a 3D image of 
space and plot the co-ordinates of your journey. 
 
The player must manually navigate through 
wormholes for fast travel - contact with the edges 
drains your shield. Electrical and ion storms are 
a constant hazard - the easiest way to avoid these 
is to use the general log to note their 
co-ordinates. Weapons can be upgraded 
 
Starfox features eight missions to be completed in 
order. The first is to shoot down 60 Space Thugs.

specific roles in the storyline, move in 
real-time, and can be given instructions. You have 
the ability to directly enter buildings, and a 
changing score is constantly kept. 
 
The land of Belorm consists of Warriors, Wizards 
and Elves. The Great Wizards ensured centuries of 
peace, before legions of orcs attacked from the 
Northern Wastes. A series of sneak attacks 
weakened Belorm, the last of them killing Elwin. 
However, the Great Book leads Greymarel the Wizard 
to believe that Kordomir is the mythical Dark One, 
and the greatest threat. Now Belorm and can only 
be saved if Greymarel, Eliador (the last of the 
Elves), and Morval the Warrior can find the 
Runestone, a sacred device sculpted by Zaphir the 
Great Wizard. 
 
Commands are input from the keyboard. You can move 
in a direction by typing (for example) GO or MOVE 
E, or alternatively can LOOK E and then GO – only 
N/S/E/W movement is offered, so moving northeast 
requires 2 moves. Instructions for other 
characters are issued using TELL or ASK. When 
issuing combat instructions, you can specify the 
target orc and the weapon to be used. Chain 
commands are accepted 
 
Greymarel has little spell-casting ability as the 
game starts, but can gain many as they are 
discovered. He also has many strange relics, which 
may prove to be of use. Key NPCs include Chronos 
the Wise, Quester the Hermit and Brunor the Bold. 
The Great Waters separate the north from the south

Depending on which title you use, and how you 
interpret it, this game is about a guy who 
a)rushes in before attacking b)attacks Russians 
(this was the mid-80s, when the US helped bin 
Laden do the same), or c)wears a rather goofy hat. 
One way or another, this arcade conversion arms 
you with a knife and sends you on a kamikaze 
mission against hordes of enemy fighters. 
 
There are four distinct sections of gameplay, 
taking in a Missile Base, a Harbour, a Bridge, and 
an enemy Prison Camp. Extra weapons with limited 
ammunition can be collected along the way, which 
will make the task a lot easier. The level is 
divided into 3 horizontal levels, which can be 
moved between either by jumping or using ladders, 
and this gives a chance to avoid the more 
threatening mobs of enemy fighters

Sabrina (c) 1988 Iber Soft / MCM Software 
 
When a person reaches elevated levels of 
popularity, the eager eyes of some programmers 
nail in him, and with these lucid minds they begin 
to emanate ideas that end up materializing into a 
program, or at least a commercial. This is the 
case with this Italian youngster singer of 
overwhelming personality that enters by the hand 
of Iber Soft to the world of videogames. 
 
The game develops the eventful journeys that a 
popular singer -Sabrina- must suffer to be able to 
be transferred from the airport to the nearest 
television studios. In order to arrive there, she 
must cross a town whose inhabitants seem to be a 
little dis-conformed with their way to be, to act 
and, mainly, to dress. 
 
Your mission will be to guide Sabrina in this 
arduous way, avoiding or eliminating as more as 
possible enemies. They are of several kinds, 
although all of them have an aspect in common: 
they are normal and current people of whom you can 
be found in the street to dozens. Thus, for 
example, the typical housewives, the knifer, the 
aggressive punkie, the exorcist priest, the old 
woman with her indispensable cane and a long list 
of others of citizen tipisms.

Saint and Greavsie is a sports trivia game where 
one to four players have to answer sport-related 
questions. Players start by throwing a ball across 
a series of stadiums. To the left of these 
stadiums is a green bar, and the higher the green 
bar, the greater the distance the ball will go. 
 
Depending on where the ball lands, the player has 
to answer three types of questions from one of 
four question packs. Home questions (worth one 
point) are generally related to modern football 
and are the easiest to answer. Away questions 
(worth two points) are generally related to 
football in the 1960s and '70s with teasers about 
'golden oldies'. Finally, derby questions (worth 
three points) will test your knowledge of football 
trivia, and these questions are fun as well as 
factual. Players can choose to answer the question 
or pass onto the next player. If the player 
chooses to answer a question correctly, a penalty 
shootout is given which involves the player 
kicking a goal to score bonus points. 
 
The winner of the game is declared after all 
players have completed 21 or 42 matches (when one 
league season is completed). The winner is the 
player who has the most points.

Saracen (c) 1987 IntelliCreations, Inc. / U.S.

A combination puzzle/action game from Datasoft.  
In each of the 100 levels, the player moves a 
crusader through an obstacle filled maze trying to 
reach the Saracen Chief and detonate a bomb next 
to him.  The chief does not move, instead 
remaining in a set position. 
 
Along the way, he must avoid roaming guards, 
bouncing cannonballs, and other traps.  The 
crusader is armed with a bow and can pick up 
directionally specific arrows that are used to 
stop guards or destroy walls. The arrows being 
limited to shooting in one of the four compass 
directions is exacerbated by only being able to 
carry one object (key, arrow or bomb) at a time. 
For these reasons, the game's puzzle leanings and 
the need for a methodical approach are strong. 
 
There is generally only one way to solve each 
level and proper use of the given tools is key to 
finding it.

Seablood (c) 1985 Adventuresoft UK Ltd. / 
Adventure International (UK) 
 
You are an intrepid pirate captain, commanding the 
corsair crew of the dread vessel the Banshee 
through the shipping lanes of Khul's so-called 
Inland Sea on an avaricious quest: to amass a hold 
full of lucre through treasure-hunting and 
outright plunder, transporting it safely through 
the troubled waters from wretched Tak in the north 
to the distant southern isle of Nippur. 
 
A loose adaptation (using many of the original's 
locations and situations, but often in new, 
streamlined ways) of Andrew Chapman's Fighting 
Fantasy gamebook #16, published earlier the same 
year, while this computer game version still 
ignores the gamebooks' Choose-Your-Own-Adventure 
multiple-choice design in favour of a limited 
two-word text-game-with-graphics interface, 
important elements of the FF system rejected in 
the earlier Adventure Soft conversion of Temple of 
Terror have been re-integrated into this 
adaptation -- notably the trademark Fighting 
Fantasy SKILL & STAMINA RPG stats-management and 
(simulated) random die-rolling for tracking damage 
and resolving combat.  (Players hoping for the 
books' third dynamic are, well, out of LUCK.) 
 
An additional extraordinary element is carried 
over from the gamebook: ship-to-ship combat, with 
your crew manifest standing in to represent an 
analogue to your boat's STAMINA score (ability to 
sustain further damage) -- handy to maintain at 
high levels while attempting to fend off menaces 
both nautical and land-based drawn from many 
fabulous and folkloric sources including Homer's 
Odyssey and the annals of Arabian hero Sinbad the 
Sailor.  The conversion also continues the 
imposition of the text adventure convention of 
carry limits unknown in the gamebook, as well as 
pre-set character stats.  Perhaps in an attempt to 
increase the game's length (at the cost of its 
replayability), mutually exclusive side-quests 
from the gamebook all become mandatory stops here 
toward a larger new goal of not merely maximising 
one's treasure-accumulation, but systematically 
denuding the entire coast of anything shiny and 
not nailed down.

Secret Diary of Adrian Mole (c) 1985 Level 9 
Computing, Ltd. / Mosaic Publishing 
 
Sue Townsend created a phenomenon in the 
mid-1980s, essentially incorporating lots of sharp 
satire and observational humour into the diary of 
a confused teenager. It might sound like an odd 
idea for a computer game, but Level 9 felt that 
there was an adventure in there. 
 
Most of the major characters from the book appear, 
including Adrian's warring parents and their 
respective flings, his sweetheart Pandora, his 
best mate Nigel, school bully Barry Kent, and 
curmudgeonly pensioner Bert Baxter. The game 
didn't use many typed commands. You would read 
passages of text (many of them from the book) and 
be given 3 choices as to what to do, which would 
lead to other events unfolding. Your aim 
throughout all of this was to make Adrian as 
popular as possible.

Sentinel, The (c) 1987 
 
A surreal and very original game by Geoff Crammond 
 
The game plays out on a 3D landscape with hills 
and valleys made up of several levels. At the 
highest vantage point stands The Sentinel,  a 
statue-like being with an energy draining stare,  
you begin at the lowest.  "Energy" plays an 
important role,  there's a constant amount in the 
game world and each object is worth a certain 
number of units - including you. 
 
The object of each level is to absorb The Sentinel 
and Hyperspace to the next from his vantage point. 
 
The Sentinel scans further round the landscape 
every few seconds - if you're caught in his gaze,  
or rather the square you are standing on can be 
seen,  you'll have about 5 seconds to teleport to 
another location (or hit a key to teleport to a 
random location - which will never be higher,  and 
may be lower than your current level) before the 
Sentinel begins absorbing your energy,  when it 
reaches zero you will be destroyed. To travel a 
"robot hull" must be created on a visible square 
then teleported to,  making sure you absorb your 
old hull to avoid losing energy. Boulders and 
trees can also be created,  trees to block The 
Sentinels view and boulders can be stacked to gain 
higher ground. 
 
There are a few other elements to the game - on 
later levels there will be other Sentries 
positioned around the landscape. If only part of 
you can be seen i.e. not the square you are 
standing on, a nearby tree can be changed into a 
"Meanie"  which will ultimately force you to 
teleport. There are 9999 levels in the game but 
the next level number is based on the current 
level + how much energy you have remaining. 
 
Sentinel Returns is a remake very true to the 
original.

Seymour goes to Hollywood to star in his first 
motion picture. As he arrives in his limousine, he 
soon discovers that the Dirk, the studio manager, 
has disappeared in Miami. Seymour must start 
production of his film by himself. 
 
Seymour Goes To Hollywood is a platform adventure, 
another Dizzy clone, this time replacing the egg 
character with an amorphous blob of unknown 
origin. Like in the Dizzy games, the main 
objective is to collect everything that isn't 
nailed down (using the fire button) to solve 
puzzles. In the upper left portion of the screen 
sits an inventory with three slots and besides 
that the score points and the energy bar. Seymour 
loses energy when touching dangerous objects and 
hazardous environments. When the bar gets empty, 
Seymour transforms into a pile of bones and the 
player loses one life. The game starts with three 
lives (shown as clack boards under the energy bar) 
and no way of saving progress.

General Zoff is holding Ambassador Kryxix captive 
in his spaceship. Plans for a new type of 
spaceship are hidden in a micro-disc embedded in 
the Ambassador's spine. If Zoff had the plans, the 
empire would be in great danger, and it is only a 
matter of time until his inquisitors will discover 
them. The Emperor has assembled the so-called 
"enigma team", a group of six reckless 
mercenaries, to take care of the situation. 
 
Players take control of all six mercenaries and 
have one hour and forty minutes to rescue 
Ambassador Kryxix and capture General Zoff. All 
six characters have different abilities. Syylk is 
an insectoid and a strong fighter, Zark Montor, 
the team leader, is an expert in unarmed combat 
and the only translator of the group, Servina 
Maris is the only character who can pick locks, 
Torik is an avian with thorough knowledge of 
explosives, Maul is a slow combat droid and Manto 
is a weak droid, but the only team member that can 
operate the transporter that is vital for the 
mission's success. 
 
Controls are completely icon based and the screen 
is divided into six sections. The upper screen 
section is called the mission command screen and 
displays which character is active, the active 
character's location and the status of all 
characters: whether they are moving, engaged in 
combat, weak or dying or performing certain action 
such as picking locks. The lower half of the 
screen changes depending on the situation and 
shows additional information and all selectable 
actions. 
 
From the main game screen (enigma team screen) 
players can choose one of the six characters and 
access four sub-screens: 
 
Character status screen: 
Shows a character's speed, strength, stamina 
(health) and carried weight. 
 
Object screen: 
Shows all objects present at a location as well as 
all objects carried by the selected character. It 
can be used to drop or pick up items, equip 
weapons and items or use special items. 
 
Movement screen: 
Here, the active character can be moved by 
clicking on arrows that show possible directions 
for a character to move. 
 
Battle screen: 
During battles, characters can scan the location 
to count and identify their enemies, move, attack 
with their equipped weapon, defend or retreat.

Shadow of the Beast (c) 1990 
 
While very young, Aarbron was kidnapped and 
enslaved by the Priests of the Beast Lord. He grew 
up on drugs made to destroy his own will and turn 
him into the Beast Messenger, a powerful creature 
serving Maletoth, The Beast Lord himself. He did 
his job, until one day he noticed a man about to 
be sacrificed in a ritual, his face triggering 
ancient memories... and as the sacrificial knife 
descended into the man's body, Aarbron recognizes 
the face. Of his father. 
As his father dies in the altar, memories of his 
childhood and tormented past at the hands of the 
Beast Lord emerged, and as feelings of hate over 
his captors took over him, he swore revenge and 
fled the temple, knowing the road to avenge his 
father and redemption would be hard. 
 
Shadow of the Beast, one of Psygnosis most popular 
titles during the 16-bit computer era is a 
side-scrolling platformer best known for the use 
of parallax scrolling along lush graphics, a 
musical score  by David Whittaker, a iconic cover 
by Roger Dean and what many consider to be 
unforgiving gameplay, balancing between the "very 
challenging" and the "impossible". The player has 
to navigate through several areas filled with 
enemies and traps, collecting keys and activating 
triggers than open new areas or give Aarbron the 
means to overcome a sub-boss. The number of moves 
the player has at disposal is limited: duck, jump 
and only two attacks: punch and a flying kick. 
While most enemies die with just one hit, the 
player must time each attack accurately. However, 
there are also traps of objects that cannot be 
destroyed, and these require the player to jump, 
duck or move according the sequence. The player 
has only one life with 12 hit points that can be 
replenished by collecting some objects hidden in 
the level (like an off-route location or a under a 
megalith), which also contributes to the 
difficulty level.

Shadow Warriors is a direct port of the arcade 
version of Ninja Gaiden. It is a beat'em up in the 
veins of Double Dragon featuring Ryu Hayabusa, a 
ninja who must fight members of an evil cult who 
seek to fulfil Nostradamus' end of the world 
prophecies. 
 
Ryu Hayabusa can attack his enemies using his his 
bare hands and feet or using a sword (for a 
limited time). He can also perform moves such as a 
flying neck throw, a back flip and hang kicks, 
performed while hanging in scenario objects. 
Throwing enemies against objects such as phone 
cabins, oil drums or dumpsters will destroy them, 
revealing power ups such as health items and 
swords. At some points, Ryu will have to perform 
acrobatic moves to carry on. He has a life bar 
starting with 5 units. 
 
The game takes place in United States' locations 
such as Las Vegas, North Carolina, Los Angeles, 
the Grand Canyon and Brooklyn. The enemies in 
those stages are mostly of the same 5 kinds, 
including Jason Vorhees' look-alikes and other 
masked men. There is a boss fight at the end of 
each stage. 
 
A two-player co-operative game is also featured. 
Whenever the player dies, a continue screen will 
appear showing Ryu chained to a table while a 
circular saw descends upon him.

Ship Of Doom (c) 1985 Artic Computing / Artic

While on a reconnaissance flight, your ship has 
been drawn by a Graviton Beam onto an Alien 
Cruiser. Fred, your pet android, informs you that 
the cruiser is on a Humanoid slave mission, its 
aim to seek out Humanoid planets from which 
samples are taken and their brains replaced by 
microchips. Your aim is to free your ship by 
pressing the control button in the main computer 
room. Of course, expect various hazards and 
puzzles to be in your way. The game features a 
simple 'Verb Noun' command interface, and no 
graphics of any description. Instructions such as 
'insert key into hole' have to be split into two 
commands.

are provided by gang members and angry citizens 
who block the shockways and have to be fought off 
with weapons or bare fists.

Wait, you say, wasn't this an Infocom title? 
Actually, this one came out first on the budget 
publisher Mastertronic's catalog. It's a vastly 
different game than the Infocom one - you wander 
around as one of a number of characters trying to 
build up your rapport with the people, doing 
battle and working your way up to becoming a 
shogun. An obscure title that I always loved - and 
the very odd graphics and gameplay, on a 2D 
surface  where you're always flying everywhere, 
were so strange, but in the end that made it a 
memorable game.

A freak bolt of lightning has made Robot 5 gain 
human feelings, and his makers at Nova Robotics 
are keen to open him up and find out how this 
happened. 5 therefore feels desperate to escape, 
and survive in the wider world. 
 
The game is split into two parts, which differ 
from the Commodore 64 game of the same name, and 
can each be played independently. The first is 
viewed in third-person 3D, as our hero moves from 
room to room through various doors. Objects can be 
picked up to allow him to jump and fire. You can 
use objects in your possession, take them by 
searching desks, or link to some of the available 
computers to use their functionality. 
 
In the second stage, armed with jumping and 
shooting abilities, Number 5 must simply escape as 
quickly as he can. Guards and Other robots are 
giving chase, and should be shot. Your robot 
becomes increasingly depressed when he kills 
wildlife, and this can eventually cost you a life, 
so make sure you jump or duck around them.

One puck, and only two competitors. One is the

using your bat, trying to knock it into your 
opponent's goal. 
 
There are several competitors, from which some of 
them definitely cheat, so be prepared to be 
laughed at. However, you can cheat as well, as you 
can resize your stick to fill the whole table 
width, or add one in the middle, and see who 
breaks glass first. There are single plays or the 
tournament where you play opponents in order of 
difficulty. The winner is the one who reaches 15

Take on the life of a buccaneer in the golden age

from 6 different "ages" (for example, "The Silver 
Empire" from 1560-1600, "War For Profit" from 
1640-1660, etc.), one of 4 nationalities (English, 
French, Dutch, Spanish), 4 difficulty levels, and 
one of 5 special abilities (skill at fencing, 
skill at navigation, etc.). Nine different types 
of ships were represented. 
 
The goal of the game is to retire with as much 
gold and land as possible, as many ranks/titles as 
possible (Colonel, Admiral, Marquis, Duke), and a 
wife. Finding long lost relatives helps too. You 
accomplish these goals by plundering cities, 
capturing and sinking enemy ships, getting in good 
with governors to receive titles, learn news of 
"evil Spaniards" holding your relatives, capturing 
evil pirates, etc. 
 
The game is educational, as you will learn about 
piracy through the thoroughly researched manual. 
You'll smell the sea salt as you participate in 
wild sword fights, desperate sea battles, and 
daring attacks by land!

lousier targets). Contend with factors like dud 
torpedoes, maximum depth, and more. 
 
You can choose among practice run against some old

Silent Shadow (c) 1988 Topo Soft / Topo Soft 
 
Silent Shadow is an arcade with a small 
aerofighter as protagonist. The objective of the 
game is to get unharmed with maximum discretion a 
huge bomber to destroy the enemy fleet in the 
Persian Gulf. To do so the player has a modern and 
sophisticated fighter whose power, speed and 
ability can get to create false images on the 
radar, making it worthy of the Silent Shadow 
nickname. 
 
To achieve the goal 4 phases must be overcome 
(airbase enemy, city, desert and the enemy fleet). 
The idea is not to depart too much from the bomber 
to avoid being hit by enemy fire, being destroyed 
and ending the game, but neither should you go too 
 slow because you could clash with the bomber, 
then losing the few opportunities you have. 
Expansionary pumps are available that can destroy 
all enemies in sight. The game allows 
collaborative game where up to 2 players can take 
one aerofighter.

score from one adventure to the next). Snowball 
has graphics for the first time, and the other two 
games have more graphics than before, and some 
longer text descriptions are added to all 3 games. 
 
Snowball: As Kim Kimberley, your mission is to 
safeguard the colonization ship Snowball 9 and its 
passengers. When you are awakened prematurely from 
hibernation, you know something's wrong! 
 
Return to Eden: Your objective is to get into the 
new city of Enoch, and stop the Eden robots from 
destroying Snowball 9. 
 
Worm in Paradise: You have to find as much 
information about the city as possible, obtain 
money, and then become a member of the governing 
party of Eden.

Player 1 would play as a helicopter, but if a 
second player joined the game, they would play as 
a jeep. Both players would have to protect each 
other as well as themselves. After a certain 
number of kills, a "goose" helicopter would form 
on the screen. If the players managed to destroy 
it they would get a weapons powerup. This would go 
on throughout the entire game (a "goose" could 
appear even during the end of level baddie!).

SimCity sets you as the mayor of a new 
municipality, with the responsibility of building 
and maintaining a place where citizens can move to 
and work and be happy. The first task is to place 
essentials such as housing, transport links, 
schools, factories and shops. There are 50 types 
of these, allowing for homes of all standards and 
different types of businesses. Make sure to 
consider which sites are effective for which 
tasks. Some power sources pollute, others don't 
but are more expensive. Taxes must be raised to 
ensure an income, and then portions allocated to 
public services such as policing and roads. 
Earthquakes, floods and fires are all emergency 
situations that must be dealt to contain any 
damage. 
 
Successful mayoring will cause the small village 
to grow into a town, then a city and finally a 
metropolis. As the city's size grows so do it's 
needs. Commercial buildings may suddenly find that 
they need an airport to expand trade, or housing 
may find itself changing rapidly as vast amounts 
of people come and leave. 
 
The game also includes 8 pre-defined time-limited 
scenarios, with specific challenges and targets. 
The environment varies in each game (especially if 
you have the Terrain Editor add on), and this 
should affect your choices.

Bart vs. The Space Mutants is a platform game 
where the player goes into the role of Bart 
Simpson (from the TV show The Simpsons) and must 
stop the Space Mutants from invading Springfield. 
 
On each of the five levels, Bart must collect (or 
get rid of) the ingredients that the Space Mutants 
are planning to use to build their machine, such 
as purple objects or balloons. He also has to 
collect enough "proof" of the aliens existence 
(brown coins left behind when they are jumped on), 
so his family members will help him when he meets 
a boss (characters such as Nelson and Sideshow 
Bob). This won't be easy since the Space Mutants 
are "using" human bodies as disguise. In order to 
discover who are the real Space Mutants, Bart must 
use his X-ray Specs. 
 
The ways Bart can get rid of those objects sought 
by the Space Mutants are numerous. For instance, 
in the first stage, Bart must get rid of purple 
objects. He can dye them red, cover them, wash 
them, etc. Some even involve a little puzzle 
solving, like playing a trick on Moe to make him 
get out of the bar. 
 
Bart also has some coins that can be used in many 
ways throughout the game, like buying things, 
getting devices operating, etc. Those coins are 
essential to solve some puzzles in the game.

There are enemies on fixed attack paths to avoid - 
Lancelot has no weapon but can jump, and survive 
any length of fall. Avoiding contact is thus a 
case of jumping out of their way, and using lower 
ledges to strategically time his moves. There are 
sections you can freely climb but not descend, so 
timing and forward planning are important. Contact 
with any of these costs one of your four lives,

Skate Crazy (c) 1988 Gremlin Graphics Software 
Ltd. / Gremlin Graphics Software Ltd. 
 
Pull on your skates and get down to the local car 
park where your prowess on eight wheels is put to 
the test in the 'Car Park Challenge'. 
 
The player grooves his way around one level of the 
car park which has been turned into a 
multidirectionally scrolling arena for the 
gladiators of roller racing. Kick cans over, 
litter to collect and obstacles to avoid in the 
shape of cones, ramps, sand, bouncing balls, 
flying frisbees, mazes of tyres and rocks, and 
even other skaters. Finishing each level is a 
battle against time to negotiate a series of gates 
in a set order, the next gate being signified by a 
row of dots which flash between its flags. 
 
To complete rounds successfully, though, suitably 
impressive stunts and tricks are carried out to 
appease a set of four judges. Each have a card 
which they periodically display at the bottom of 
the screen, notifying the player of his progress. 
When the player's energetic jumping skills have 
gained enough points to qualify, he skates through 
the finishing gate and has his performance rated. 
Failing to qualify forces the player to skate 
around the car park against the clock, picking up 
a set number of pieces of litter. Beating a level 
allows the player to skate to the level's exit 
ramp, from where he chooses to move up to the next 
level or leave the car park and move onto the next 
part of the game, 'The Skate Crazy Championship 
Course'. 
 
This section of the game is a race against time 
over four horizontally scrolling cityscapes of 
platforms and ramps, with the player building up 
speed on his skates using a paced joystick 
waggling movement. Ground level obstacles and gaps 
in the floor are crossed with leaps of 
controllable strength and items at head height are 
avoided by judicious ducking. Birds and other 
creatures also spell doom for the heroic skater, 
unless he is able to avoid them or throw things at 
them. 
 
Points are scored in this section by picking up 
extra skating paraphernalia, such as pads, 
clothes, skates and litter.

Rodney's skate shop to buy equipment. 
 
The first event is freestyle, in which your aim is 
to score as many points as possible in 10 
attempts. Judges determine how much style and 
skill you have shown. The High Jump uses the same 
equipment, only this time your task is to jump as 
high as possible at the end of the ramp. 
 
The downhill events are overhead-view races. In 
the Downhill Race you simply try to complete the 
course within 90 seconds. In the Downhill Jam you 
try to outperform a human or computer opponent 
whilst dodging or jumping hazards. You can use 
attacking moves to either remove hazards or knock 
your opponent over. 
 
The pool joust is more of a one-on-one beat em up 
using a stick, set within a pit to skate around.

Skull and Crossbones (c) 1991 Atari Games 
Corporation / Domark Software Ltd. 
 
Fight as either Red Beard or One Eye through 
various pirate themed levels, like ships and 
forts, and even some non-pirate themed levels, 
battling ninjas, skeletons, and others in a quest 
to get back your hard earned money from an evil 
wizard. You can also fight side by side with a 
friend (who controls the pirate you didn't 
choose). 
 
Fighting works like fencing, with a few different 
moves to use, including parrying. The levels 
scroll through with a boss at the end of each. You 
gain money by vanquishing foes and digging for 
treasure where X marks the spot.

removing the colour, and it was only after he died 
that they had the opportunity to clean the land 
up. Your job is to travel through the 99

Skweek can move in each of the four compass 
directions, and is armed with a simple weapon, 
whose shots rebound around before they hit one of 
Pitark's minions, the Schnoreuls - contact with 
which is instantly fatal. Some squares contain 
arrows which force you in a particular direction, 
while there are also blockades to avoid. Bomb 
squares blow up surrounding squares but give you 
time to move away from them as they do this, while 
Shortcut squares allow you to move to another 
teleport-type square by pushing the joystick in 
its direction.

The last of the evil Drune Wizards who have been 
ruling Lyonesse is dead. Don't get the champagne 
out yet though, because his evil power lives on 
until his name (which, as with all the Drunes, is 
a closely-guarded secret) is said. The only person 
who knows it is his daughter, who is trapped in 
Small Sky Tower. This, coupled with the fact that 
she's reputedly beautiful, is all the incentive 
Slaine needs to track her down. 
 
The game system is unusual - known as REFLEX, it 
is menu-based, but these menus appear and 
disappear in real-time, meaning that the game has 
a constant aspect of pressure and 
time-sensitivity. You must collect and examine 
objects, map your way through Lyonesse, and use 
your mighty sword where needed. Slaine must keep 
an eye on his Warp rating, which drops in 
unsuccessful combat but is replenished either by 
physical (eating food) or mental (the high of 
winning a battle, or having a run of time without 
one) factors, and has a big effect on his 
performance.

SLAP-SHOT! Hockey is a fast-action ice hockey 
simulation game. Each ice hockey match has three 
periods that last three minutes each. 
The puck can be passed from player to player at 
varying speeds and directions. The game allows you 
to give opponents a body check and you can even 
control the strength of it. 
However, when you are playing too roughly it is 
possible that you'll get penalized. 
 
To win a match you will have to develop a good 
match strategy, good skating and passing skills 
and quick reflexes. 
 
This game can be played by one or two players.

A simple enough futuristic sports game that isn't 
a world away from Marble Madness. You control a 
ball over a futuristic landscape, the idea being 
to find the puck that's hidden somewhere in the 
level and "herd" it back to your starting point. 
Sounds simple enough, except for one thing, 
there's another player (either computer or human) 
trying to do the same thing. 
 
This results in incredibly hectic gameplay. Add 
this to the fact that sometimes you're negatively 
charged to the puck (and thus kick it away) or 
positively charged (so the puck sticks to you) and 
you're in for a crazy time!

In Slightly Magic you are cast as Slightly - 
mischievous nephew of legendary wizard Bigwiz, who 
has suddenly taken off on some urgent business, 
leaving his castle in disarray with dragons and 
magical spells running amok. One of the dragons 
kidnaps the princess, and now Slightly has to save 
her. 
 
In addition to standard inventory puzzles of Dizzy 
games, Slightly Magic introduces a magic system 
that requires multiple objects to be combined in 
order to achieve effects ranging from frightening 
the enemies to turning the player into a fish.

The Slugger (c) 1985 Ocean Software Ltd. / Imagine 
 
In this early UK-developed baseball simulation, 
one or two player matches can be played over 3,6 
or 9 innings, with 3 different computer skill 
levels. The rules are explained by some 
introductory screens, and the game is fully 
faithful to these. Gameplay is in an arcade/action 
style, so you don't need to worry about statistics 
for different teams or players. 
 
The main viewing area is a forced-perspective view 
of the field, with a small side-viewed window of 
the pitcher's delivery itself. When fielding, 
control automatically goes to the player nearest 
to the ball, but a point doesn't end until the 
pitcher has the ball back (unless it is a home 
run). Features include stealing bases, pitching 
curve balls, or customizing the colors of each 
team. 
 
The game has been presented with considerable 
glitz, with cheerleaders on screen between innings 
and lots of advertising boards and other slogans.

There are bad guys to shoot and bullets to avoid,

The first level involves skydiving down the screen 
and shooting at the agents as they themselves fall

the direction that you want to go (eg: N for

The year is 1999. The world's most popular 
television show is Smash T.V., an ultra-violent 
contest between two armed-to-the-teeth combatants, 
set loose in a series of deadly arenas that are 
filled to bursting with hordes of mindless beasts 
and killer robots. The aim of the game is to blast 
everything in sight and try to grab more cash and 
prizes than the other guy. Toaster ovens, VCRs, 
fancy cars and luxury holidays are there for the 
taking... for anyone who can survive long enough 
to enjoy them. 
 
Smash T.V. is an insane shoot-em-up from the brain 
of Eugene Jarvis, creator of Robotron: 2084. It 
retains that game's frantic style of play and 
two-joystick control method, but adds plenty of 
gore, violence, a hint of satire and that 
all-important two player mode.

on, others must be dodged. Hidden bonuses and 
magic can be found on many of the levels, 
sometimes even hidden in blocks. Some treasures 
give you bonus points, others can form magic 
spells to help deal with the enemies. To make the 
game more difficult, each level has a time limit 
in which it must be completed.

Sooty's Fun With Numbers (c) 1990 Enigma 
Variations Ltd. / Alternative Software Ltd. 
 
Six short mathematical tests aimed at children up 
to 7 years of age come together in this package. 
Sooty the silent magical bear is one of the UK’s 
most enduring children’s characters, and his 
friends Sweep the squeaking dog and Soo the 
talking bear join him here. The games can be 
played with little or no computer knowledge, and 
feature full graphics. 
 
In Magic Numbers the player must count how many 
wands Sooty has on the screen. Sweep’s Bones 
involves moving bones from a pile on the right 
(Sweep’s stash) to the left (the ones he will 
enjoy today). Soo’s Hats is an addition test. In 
Bigger/Smaller you are presented with 2 numbers, 
and asked to select the biggest or smallest, which 
Sooty will magic away with his wand. Order Order 
presents a line of numbers, some of which are 
filled in, and challenges the player to select the 
others (which are randomly arranged elsewhere on 
the screen) and place them in the correct 
positions. Soo’s Race brings these skills together 
– you are asked a succession of questions, and 
answering them correctly will see Sooty’s car move 
along a track, and hopefully win its race against 
Sweep.

Sorcerer Lord (c) 1987 Personal Software Services 
/ Personal Software Services 
 
Sorcerer Lord is a medieval fantasy game of 
tactical warfare. 
 
The evil Shadowlord's army is threatening to 
overrun the peaceful country of Galanor. The 
alliance of races in Galanor isn't very fond of 
suppression, slavery or extinction, so they are 
preparing for war -- it's your job to coordinate 
the Galanorian defense. 
 
Movement and combat are turn-based. You and the 
Shadowlord alternately recruit new troops, move 
armies on a 2D hex-map of the land and try to 
conquer the enemies garrisons. The outcome of 
fights is shown as plain text only. Although the 
gameplay is quite simple, there are a few tactical 
knacks like certain races fighting more fiercely 
in certain terrain types, fatigue levels and basic 
statistics for army leaders. Despite the game's 
title, magic is a rather unimportant element of 
chance in battles and not under your direct 
control. 
 
The game contains a time limit

To save planet Nonterraqueous from a

built a robot to attack the super-computer. 
Cunningly, it was designed with such tortured 
feelings that it can only be happy in successful 
death, so you must take it to the computer to blow 
itself up. 
 
The game is a succession of 256 platform-based 
screens, each of which has many obstacles and 
hazards. There are 5 levels of jump intensity, and 
the correct one must be used to clear each hazard 
and reach the next jump. The maze is split into 3 
sections, with the computer in the last of these, 
and these can only be reached via a teleport.

Soviet tank. This tank must explore the areas of 
Vilnius and Baku and rescue all Russian citizens. 
Meanwhile, the rebel armies will attack with 
everything they have. 
 
The game uses an overhead view of the battlefield 
and multi-directional scroll. The gameplay is 
reminiscent of games like SWIV, but the need to 
rescue a certain number of hostages to complete 
the level adds a limited strategy element: the 
goal of the game is not to defeat the enemies, a 
task literally impossible as they re-spawn within 
seconds, but to rescue the hostages before being 
blown up.

Space Crusade (c) 1992 Gremlin Graphics Software 
Ltd. / Gremlin Graphics Software Ltd. 
 
Space Crusade is a science fiction strategy game 
converted from the Games Workshop/Milton Bradley 
boardgame, in which you control a commander and 
four marines who are sent on different missions 
aboard hostile alien starships. Your commander 
starts off as a sergeant, but he can work his way 
through the ranks. The game allows three players, 
each commanding one marine chapter each. The alien 
team is `played` by the computer. 
 
The game is a literal conversion of the board game 
in the same vein as Gremlin's earlier Hero Quest. 
It can be best described as a turn-based board 
game in which the player must fulfill the primary 
and secondary objectives to complete the mission, 
which usually involves elimination of entire alien 
force on board or destruction of mothership etc. 
This game features unique 3D close-ups during the 
battle scenes, a feature which was later adopted 
by games like the X-Com series.

Space Gun (c) 1992 Taito Corporation / Ocean 
Software Ltd. 
 
2039 A.D. Man begins deep space exploration in 
search of new life forms and usable fuel sources. 
What he discovers is trouble. 
 
Until now, the success of past explorations was 
causing the space effort to grow by leaps and 
bounds. Until now, the explorers had found little 
more than fungus and small insects as alternative 
lifeforms. Until now, the chief dangers had been 
those posed by the hostile environment of space. 
Until now, the aliens had not known about THEM. 
 
On the ragged edge of the galaxy, other creatures 
that roam the stars discover humans and spaceships 
to be excellent sources of food and other 
resources. Prepared at the worst for clashes with 
rival exploration teams, the human crews can do 
little to 
defend themselves as wave upon wave of nightmare 
creatures descend upon their ships and bases. 
 
In response to their distress calls, the 
Federation has assembled a series of rescue teams, 
lead by their best military sharpshooters, to deal 
with the alien menace. As the leader of one of 
these teams, you must gun down the intruders and 
pick up the human survivors. Brave the maze of 
dark corridors that may lead to a deadly shootout 
between you and legions of monsters. Pick up 
survivors and extra ammo on the way.

Pete Cooke's follow-up to the previous space 
shooter-explorer takes things away from the Tau 
Ceti setting. Players take the role of a student 
at an academy for advanced piloting. There they 
need to solve 20 simulated missions on a wide 
range of planets. 
 
The self-contained missions mean that the game 
uses the Tau Ceti structure and theme, without the 
causality of previous decisions having an effect 
on later choices. This reduces the complexity of 
management. Although players can customize the 
ships, including giving them names of your choice, 
the game comes with supplied ones include a 
variety that should suit many different 
circumstances. 
 
Whichever vehicle is chosen, players will control 
it from a 1st person perspective and a series of 
controls. All ships skim over the surface of the 
planet and feature weapons. Most missions will 
involve destroying rogue robots enemies. Players 
will have to dock with buildings to refuel or move 
on to a different planet.

game is played from a first person perspective in

everything from the shuttles engines to cargo bay 
doors. When the game is over you will be given a

creating and removing blocks to alter its path. 
The game is prevented from being a pure clone due 
to the ball, which moves automatically once 
activated, and can be controlled by using 
strategically-placed blocks. 
 
Simply reaching the ball usually involves 
modifying the level layout using these bricks. 
There are enemies moving on fixed paths which must 
be avoided, and bonus items to collect. Also watch 
for bonuses such as invincibility, 
gravity-alteration and teleporting. You take time 
to rotate, so the controls aren't truly immediate. 
The ball takes 20 seconds to start moving, so use 
this time to plan ahead.

As GERALD (Gyroscopic ExploRAtion Landing Device) 
you must explore 385 screens of Hangworld, using 
limited fuel. The game is viewed isometrically, 
which means that the controls are rotated through 
90 degrees - this, coupled with the fact that many 
screens have huge gaps and diagonal paths, means 
that it's hard to get far at first. Falling off 
ledges loses you time, which is very limited to 
start with 
 
Gerald must collect energy crystals throughout his 
journey - which can also be shortened by using a 
complex system of lifts. Sections you have 
travelled through are automatically mapped.

You're in a castle, where a series of magical 
phenomena have been taking place: a young girl and 
a military armor have been victims of an 
enchantment. Its author, an evil warlock and our 
main enemy, has adopted the form of an eagle and 
has also requested help of a legion of ghosts, 
monsters, demons, werewolves and other kinds of 
despicable creatures, that will try to avoid that 
we can reach their master. 
 
Once we get started, our immediate goal will 
consist in the following: In the first place, as 
every classic magician, we should go in search of 
our crystal ball. Once we have it, we are going to 
be able to see which are the movements of all the 
relevant personages in the story (the young lady, 
the armor and the eagle), also, it's going to show 
us where are the resting two elements required for 
our adventure: the magic wand (with which we will 
counter-enchant the girl) and the book of spells 
(essential to break the spell of the armor). 
 
Here it is where the graphical innovations of the 
program will occupy the an important place in the 
game. All these monitorings above mentioned are 
possible because the screen is divided in two 
zones. In the superior part we will see the 
adventures of our personage. Simultaneously, in 
the inferior zone, there will appear the exact 
place of the castle in which the object or 
personage we are looking for is located.

This flight simulation sets you as a young 
Spitfire pilot in 1940, when World War 2 is 
hotting up in the skies over the south of England. 
The program is viewed from within the cockpit, 
with the instrument panel viewed by pressing 
Space. The pilot will have to co-ordinate landing 
gear, brakes and ruddering, and use a map to 
navigate and find targets. Loops, rolls and 
split-S moves are all incorporated in the 
simulation logic. 
 
The game can generate random combat situations - 
for example, 6 enemies 10 miles away, 1500 feet 
into the air. Once you have established a strong 
flight record you can take on the missions. 
Additionally there are practice modes for both 
flying and combat.

This game is based on the long-running British 
satirical television show with puppet likenesses 
of political figures and celebrities.  A prophet 
determines that a world war will occur in seven 
years instigated by a mysterious leader.  To avoid 
this, one ruler of the world must be determined in 
this beat 'em up involving six rulers: U.S.A.'s 
Ronald Regan, the U.K.'s Margaret Thatcher, the 
USSR's Mikhail Gorbachev, South Africa's PW Botha, 
Iran's Ayathollah Khomeini, and Pope John Paul II. 
 
Having chosen which to play as, you travel to an 
opponent's country to engage in a best-of-three 
fight that is judged by Queen Elizabeth II on a 
postage stamp.  You attack each opponent on the 
ground as well as jumping in the air and each 
character has a special move like Thatcher's 
head-butt or Khomeini's beard whip.  You can also 
call for help twice from an aide who will usually 
throw a projectile at your opponent. 
 
If you manage to defeat all 5 opponents, you will 
meet the mysterious leader in a final showdown in 
a mud-wrestling pit in the dark where you will 
only be able to see the eyes of the characters.  
You can also play 2-player fights, one against 
another on the same computer.

eating all the patches of grass. The screen 
scrolls in four directions, and the walls of the 
level are in a different pattern on each level, 
and must always be avoided for fear of losing a 
life. The main thing making life harder is that 
the level is always scrolling in random 
directions, and contact with the wall at the edge 
of the screen costs you a life. As a result, 
careful planning is required to ensure that you 
don't get trapped into a corner. There are seven 
levels of increasing difficulty to get through.

Sliding block puzzle games were one of the many 
non-electronic forms of entertainment re-made with 
new twists for the digital age. The basic premise 
involves being presented with 1 of 10 pictures 
(representing famous figures such as Ronald 
Reagan, Maggie Thatcher, Lady Diana and even Sir 
Clive Sinclair), with the complete picture 
presented at the side of the screen. You must move 
your cursor onto the, pick up a piece, and place 
it onto the main playing area, ensuring that you 
can move the others into place. Unlike with the 
plastic versions there are 16 pieces to fit into 
20 spaces, allowing more leeway in terms of 
continual sliding. The complications in this 
version include gaps in the playing area which 
swallow pieces and return them to the bank, a time 
limit, bombs which have to be moved off the screen 
to avoid losing a life, and bonus objects to be 
moved in specific ways for bonus points.

As an experienced ghoul-chaser, you think you can 
handle anything when you get a call to explore a 
haunted mansion. You soon realize that you're 
wrong, however, and you'll need all of your skills 
to deal with 384 screens of spookiness. 
 
It's an arcade adventure, with ghosts to avoid as 
they cause your character to fall off course, 
sometimes down a screen or two. Collecting bugs 
and beetles allows you to use one of the cauldrons 
to produce spells to kill enemies. You have 4 
minutes on each life, although more can be picked 
up from the many egg-timers around the screens. 
The game keeps track of your 'Scaredyness factor' 
and adjusts the game difficulty to help struggling 
players accordingly. 
 
The eventual target is to collect items to turn 
into letters - earning enough of these allows you 
to play a Hangman game against the 'spooky old 
man'.

Sporting Triangles (c) 1989 CDS Software Ltd / CDS 
Software Ltd 
 
A licensed version of a British TV game show from 
the late 1980s. 
 
The game features 3 players, all either human or 
computer. Each chooses a category of questions out 
of 12 on offer - some are for a single sport (such 
as soccer or cricket) while others a more general 
(such as Indoor Sport and Pot Luck). 
 
Four of the seven rounds involve each player being 
asked a question, which could be from one of the 3 
selected categories, or it could be general sport. 
A die is rolled, and the colour of its final 
position on the board indicates the type of 
question. 
 
The other 3 rounds include Hit For Six, in which 
you get a succession of clues and have to work out 
which of the 6 named people they refer to - get it 
as quickly as you can to maximize your score. 
 
The Jigsaw round involves identifying a club 
crest, pitch for a particular sport or similar, 
with a piece added to the picture after each 
incorrect guess. Again the score declines the more 
guesses you need. There's an 'on the buzzer' 
questions round at the end.

Alternative World Games Is a series of mini games 
based around the theme of an Olympiad for the 
non-sporting minded. It is intended to be a spoof 
on all serious sporting simulations. 
 
There are eight games in this compilation, some 
are one player and some are two player. The 
minimum number of players names that can be 
entered is two, the game setup insists that a 
second player is named because thee are two player 
games. The maximum number of names that can be 
entered is six. 
 
The game menu selection screen has been designed 
to look like a bank of nine TV screens. Each TV is 
displaying a sporting channel name. The player 
selects the channels to be played and presses 
'Fire'. This causes an animation to commence on 
the appropriate TV. The player can select either 
one or all eight games. Channel nine is used to 
allow the player to select between competition and 
practice modes. 
 
At the end of each game the scores are displayed. 
After the last game has been played the game 
displays the medal table, there can be a long wait 
while the game reads to the end of the tape to 
find this program. 
When the selected game(s) have been played the 
medal table is displayed and the gaming session is 
over. If further game-play is desired, e.g. for a 
rematch, then the whole game must be reloaded and 
the player selection process has to be repeated.

A conversion of the arcade game, Spy Hunter is a 
driving action game played from an overhead point 
of view. Your car is equipped with machine guns to 
help you get past the numerous enemies out on the 
road (be careful not to shoot any civilians, 
though!) Occasionally you will come across a 
weapons van, and if you drive into the back of the 
van your car becomes equipped with a second weapon 
(such as smoke screen, oil slick, or missiles.) At 
several points the road splits and you can enter a 
boathouse which transforms your car into a boat 
temporarily. If you drive far enough the seasons 
change as well (watch out for icy conditions 
during winter!) The enemy cars will do anything to 
stop you, including running you off the road, 
firing guns from the back of a limmo, or dropping 
bombs from a helicopter.

Ricky Steel is a feared renegade with a mechanical 
arm to fire bullets, and his Class A101 armoured

lives in a Mad Max-inspired world, but Dr. Vardos 
has sent a horde of androids to destroy it. Take 
control of Steel and stop this, in this Spy 
Hunter-style vertically scrolling road-based 
shooter. 
 
The game is split into four sections. You begin on 
foot, and must travel up the screen to reach the 
Nightwind. Helicopters and other foes must be shot 
or avoided, and their bullets avoided. You then 
enter your vehicle and drive up the screen, 
dealing with similar hazards. The controls involve 
pushing forward to accelerate and pushing down to 
reverse. Level 2 involves taking to the water, 
attacking submarines using bombs. The final 
showdown involves hunting down and killing Vardos, 
despite the attentions of animal-shaped asteroids 
and other hazards. 
 
The scanner along the bottom of the screen is 
crucial to spotting foes as they approach. You 
have a limited shield, turned on and off by 
pressing space, and limited fuel which is 
recharged by collecting fuel circles which float 
by.

The Blodroid Empire has launched a mass attack on 
Earth. Fortunately, its entire network of ships 
use shields powered remotely from a single 
generator located on their homeworld. As a feared 
pilot, you must fly your Astrohunter spaceship 
through hostile territory to destroy it. 
 
The journey is viewed from above. The threat is 
from nine increasingly-tough Supercruisers, which 
have the ability to launch spaceships, missiles 
and mines. These must all be avoided or shot out. 
In this part of the game, you have four lives, 
represented by shields which deplete as you take 
hits. 
 
The last Supercruiser contains the six 
all-important Generator panels. This final phase 
of the game takes place on foot, as you destroy 
them with projectiles. You must then return to 
your ship before everything explodes and takes you 
with it.

Star Glider (c) 1986 Argonaut Software Ltd. / 
Rainbird Software 
 
The Planet Novenia has been attacked by the 
Egrons, who snuck in by disguising their craft as 
the protected Starglider species, which Novenia's 
automated defenses were programmed not to shoot. 
 
Your task is to fight them off using only an 
obsolete Airborne Ground Attack Vehicle. This was 
designed as the ultimate combat machine, with 
sophisticated hardware up to Draziw Yarg's high 
standards. It has a fully-rechargeable shield, 
plasma drive unit, an inbuilt scanner and 
10,000-sector map, a top speed of 2550 Urads and 
two homing missiles. 
 
The game is viewed from within AGAV's cockpit, 
with control over speed, weapon targeting and 
firing. There are several control options to 
decide exactly how the craft works, with fixed or 
floating sighting, and the option of automatic 
centering, allowing you to balance the game 
between easy sighting and advanced shooting 
ranges. 
 
Repair depots must be visited frequently, as they 
can refill the weapon bays as well as repairing 
the ship. Crucially, the Egron Stargliders need 3 
missiles to shoot down, so at least 1 visit to a 
depot is required to complete this job, at which 
point you move up to the next, harder, level.

Starion (c) 1985 
 
Aliens using a time machine have changed several 
crucial events in earth history. As Starion, a 
rookie starfighter pilot in 2010AD, you must 
correct these, in a hybrid of puzzle and action. 
 
There are 243 sectors to correct, each 
representing a year. After selecting one, you are 
involved in first-person space dogfighting, viewed 
from within your cockpit. Pay attention to your 
multi-directional scanner to locate ships and 
mines. There are also indicators for your fuel and 
oxygen levels, pitch and yaw, and engine 
temperature. 
 
Shot enemies release letters, which must then be 
flown over. Once an area is cleared, you must use 
the letters to form a word. Then, fly through the 
time gate, and decide which historical event the 
word relates to.

Bus Software 
 
As BLOB, the Bio-Logically Operated Being, you are 
sent into an unstable planet and charged with the 
task of preventing it from exploding. This 
involves collecting various items (the exact 
combination is different every time you load the 
game) and taking them to the planet's core. 
 
The game is an arcade adventure viewed from the 
side, with 512 screens arranged in a 16x32 
pattern. A teleport system exists, so once you 
find the codes you can get quick access to 
different parts of the game. 
 
The creatures to avoid are intelligent, getting 
tougher to predict as you get closer to the 
centre, but you are armed with a gun and can also 
try to avoid them. BLOB has a set of platforms 
which can be used to allow limited vertical 
movement, but these disappear after a few seconds 
each use.

body. 
 
Before you start you must create your character, 
including his appearance and initial abilities, 
and choose one of five play styles. You can start 
off as a New Pro or a Contender - the latter 
option means tougher fights form the word go, but 
you start halfway up the rankings. A full training

boxer's abilities to best prepare for the next 
fight.

In Realtime's previous Starstrike game (not to be 
confused with Star Strike), the evil Outsiders 
attacked the Federation and had to be forced back. 
This time, the boot's on the other foot, as the 
Federation have sent their Starstrike II vehicles 
in to take them out. Armed with sophisticated 
computers, lasers and shields, all it needs is a 
good pilot, such as yourself. 
 
Twenty-two planets fall under Outsiders control, 
and each has grid-based defenses which must be 
taken out, complete with all their command 
computers and production droids. The planets are 
split into five groups, each of which can be 
chosen at the start of the game. 
 
The combat is intense, and aims to create the 
likely feel of space combat, with lots of ducking 
and weaving to set up shots. The game features 
filled-in graphics, unlike the Elite-esque 
wireframes of the first game.

Star Trap (c) 1989 Loriciels / Loriciels 
 
Year is 2189, humanity has visited numerous 
galaxies due to the hyper-space engines. In search 
of adventure and exotics of the distant lands you 
have signed contract for 5 years with the 
Intergalactic Company to work on the Space Lines. 
For your first trip you were appointed as 
technician trainee on the freighter AMPELOS. The 
freighter left Achernar VI in direction of Tau 
Ceti II. Some hours later you were in the room of 
piloting when suddenly all alarms start... What is 
that? You have only 8 hours to discover it. 
 
You start to explore the freighter AMPELOS. Robots 
became uncontrollable and attack you. They are 
surely behind the commander's death. Happily, the 
computer can help you to deactivate them. But your 
adventure is only beginning and already the cap of 
the dead commander (peace to his soul) reveal a 
number, which you remembers quickly. 
 
The gameplay flows as the icon-based first-person 
adventure. You may move in available directions 
and do the actions via set of  icons, which are 
"Take", "Put", "Look at", "Examine", "Use", and 
some new such as "Listen", "Recharge" (a battery, 
a weapon). Another icon allows you to start a 
dialogue, for example, with the navigator or the 
doctor. You can then ask them simple questions 
from predefined words such as "HOW TO DEACTIVATE 
ROBOTS?" and you'll hear the words pronounced. At 
the right side of the screen you'll see the 
objects in your possessions and useful 
information: health, fatigue, your ammunition, 
your reservation of air (if you are wearing a 
combine suit). When you arrive in a place, you 
should use the icon to look at the place (the 
eye), sometimes several times to discover objects. 
Then (and before taking the object) you should use 
the magnifier on the object, because it can't be 
used on the object already put in inventory. 
 
Amstrad CPC version of the game is port of Atari 
ST version and use only 4 colours.

The arcade game from Atari based on the third Star 
Wars movie features three action sequences 
inspired by the film. 
 
First, you control Princess Leia on a speeder bike 
racing through the forests on Endor. You have to 
evade trees and deal with enemy troopers by 
shooting at them or luring them into Ewok traps. 
 
In the second sequence, you control Chewbacca who 
has captured an Imperial AT-ST Walker, evading 
tree traps and shooting at enemy walkers. In this 
sequence, the perspective sometimes switches to 
the Millennium Falcon which you must guide through 
a fleet of enemy Star Destroyers and TIE Fighters. 
 
In the final sequence, the Millennium Falcon 
enters the Death Star and has to make its way to 
the reactor, surviving more TIE Fighters and laser 
turrets. Once the reactor is destroyed, you have 
to get out again before the explosion engulfs the 
ship. 
 
After the Death Star has been destroyed, the game 
restarts at the first sequence, but with a higher 
difficulty.

Star Wars - The Empire Strikes Back (c) 1988 Atari 
Games Corporation / Domark Software, Inc. 
 
The arcade game from Atari Games based on the 
second Star Wars movie features four action 
sequences inspired by the film. The graphical 
style is similar to the first Star Wars game, 
using vector graphics with a first-person 
perspective. 
 
The first sequence takes place on the ice planet 
Hoth, where the player must destroy Imperial probe 
droids. The droids send transmissions to the 
Empire that can also be targeted and destroyed. 
Once enough transmissions have been sent, the 
Empire attacks. 
 
In the second sequence, the player has to fend off 
Imperial walkers, either by shooting a limited 
number of tow cables at their feet or by targeting 
a small area at their head with lasers. But sooner 
or later, the Rebel base's power generator will be 
destroyed and the evacuation begins. 
 
In the third sequence, the Millennium Falcon has 
to destroy TIE Fighters in space. 
 
In the fourth and final sequence, the Falcon must 
navigate through an asteroid field, avoiding 
collisions. 
 
Once the four sections have been completed, the 
game restarts at a higher difficulty level.

Station Fall (c) 1987 Infocom, Inc. / Infocom, 
Inc. 
 
(From Infocom Home Page site) 
 
After the fall of the Second Galactic Union in 
1716 GY, a ten-thousand-year dark age settled upon 
the galaxy. Interstellar travel was nonexistent, 
and many star systems descended into a 
near-barbaric state, buring coal and gas for 
energy, and growing food directly from exposed 
topsoil. In 11,203 GY, a treaty between the 
Empires of Tremain and Galium formed the Third 
Galactic Union. Ships of the Stellar Patrol (a 
pseudo-military wing of the Union government on 
Tremain) began exploring the galaxy, searching for 
the human civilizations that are the remnants of 
the Second Galactic Union. You are a native of the 
planet Gallium, one of the most politically 
powerful but culturally barren worlds in the 
Union. Your great-great-grandfather was a founding 
officer of the Stellar Patrol, and for five 
generations, your family has served in the Patrol. 
It was always taken for granted that you would 
sign up as soon as you came of age. Once in the 
Patrol, you discovered that the exciting career 
promised in all the Patrol recruitment brochures 
was nonsense. Your life was drudgery and demerits. 
The one time you got to see an exotic planet was 
right after a big parade, when they needed a 
detail to sweep up all the confetti. Then came 
your big moment: shipwrecked on a seemingly 
deserted world, you met an exuberant robotic 
companion named Floyd. Together, the two of you 
discovered the secret of that mysterious planet, 
Resida, and saved it from near destruction. As a 
result of your heroics, you were offered, and 
quickly accepted, a juicy promotion. Good-bye 
Ensign Seventh Class -- hello Lieutenant First 
Class! No more scrubwork! No more bathroom 
details! No more cleaning groth cages! Finally, 
your life in the Stellar Patrol would be as 
exciting as those brochures had promised! Oh, how 
naive you'd been. Your daily routine simply 
replaced tedious scrubwork with tedious paperwork. 
Since your planetfall on Resida, five long years 
have dragged by, without a single event worthy of 
note. Why, just look at today's "thrilling" 
assignment: scooting over to Space Station Gamma 
Delta Gamma 777-G 59/59 Sector Alpha-Mu-79 to pick 
up a supply of Request for Stellar Patrol Issue

Steg the slug has to feed his family of 
"T'yungunz".  To do this he must blow bubbles to 
catch the grubs that they feed on and guide them 
through the level by blowing on them or nudging 
them past any obstacles in the way to the nest 
where T'yungunz live.  To complete a level, you 
must make sure that a certain number of T'yungunz 
are fully fed so they go to sleep.  If they don't 
get enough food then eventually they die. 
 
The levels are full of contraptions such as 
bellows, and obstacles such as spikes and fire 
that will burst the bubbles.  Some of these can be 
activated or deactivated using various switches. 
 
Usually Steg navigates each level by walking on 
the floor, and also he can climb up the walls and 
even walk on the ceiling.  There are also devices 
he can contruct out of the parts from the Acme 
Bionic Bitz Catalogue, such as the Rocket Pack, 
and Bionic Legs, which allow different ways of 
getting around each level.

Mike Lamb recreated the basic rules of the popular 
English game of snooker in this simulation, which 
can be played by one or two players, but has no 
computer opponent as such, unlike the later 16-bit 
remake. 
 
Instead, you are scored based not only on how many 
points you score legitimately, but also on how 
many points you concede through foul shots, and 
how many shots you take in total. You always take 
the next shot, even if you've missed or fouled, so 
in a one player game the break-building strategies 
can be slightly more aggressive than in a real 
match, as there's no risk of leaving an opponent a 
chance 
 
As in the real game you start off by trying to pot 
a red (there are 10 or the real 15, depending on 
which mode you choose), and if successful choosing 
one of the 6 colours (by pressing the number 
corresponding to its points value). Once you've 
lined up the direction of the shot, you will have 
to set the speed, and then the spin.

English terms, so instead of talking to characters 
you 'Chinwag' with them, and fights are called 
'Fisticuffs'. These are a key aspect of the game, 
requiring prompt arcade reactions and correct move 
selection, especially as using the low blow too 
often results in a character being wiped out.

Street Cred Football (c) 1989 Players Software / 
Players Software 
 
Removing the corporate poshness and ambition of 
modern football, this Players title gives you a 
basic street match for one or two human players. 
Hitting the crate which is used to represent a 
goal more times than the opponent to win is the 
only rule. Your team of 5 players is selected from 
a pool of 24, including representations of the 
programmers as well as Joe Blade and other Players 
characters, and these can be placed at will around 
the pitch. Once in play you control the player 
nearest the ball, with full passing and shooting 
control available. Dirty challenges are not only 
permitted but encouraged.

Street Fighter (c) 1988 Capcom Co., Ltd. / GO! 
 
You are Ryu, a Street Fighter. Your goal is to 
travel to 5 countries (Japan, USA, England, China 
and Thailand) and beat 2 enemies at each of them. 
Many of these characters, such as Adon, Gen, and 
Birdie, are later seen in the Street Fighter Alpha 
series. 
 
After each country you will have the chance to get 
additional points in a little bonus round, a 
feature seen later in most Street Fighter games. 
 
The final boss in the game is Sagat, who is the 
second to the last boss in Street Fighter 2. The 
goal is to become the greatest fighter in the 
world. As with most tournament fighting games once 
you have defeated the boss the game will reset and 
start from the beginning with a harder difficulty 
level. 
 
It is possible to start a two player game but 
there will be only one fight (between the two 
players) which will determine who will travel the 
globe to fight the computer controlled opponents.

Street Hawk (c) 1986 Ocean Software Ltd. / Ocean 
Software Ltd. 
 
After an intensive 18-month research program, 
Jesse Mach's super bike is finally ready to hit 
the mean streets. 
 
Jesse has vowed to avenge the death of his best 
friend, and goes on a mission to take down the 
villains whether they may be. But Jesse need not 
look no further than the street. The baddies are 
driving XR3's, so all it would take is one laser 
blast in the XR3 fuel tank, and the cars are 
immobilized. 
 
Zooming along, the player has to serve through 
traffic, dodging the bullets fired by the bad guys 
and eliminating carloads of criminals while taking 
care not to kill innocent citizens. As well as the 
built-in lasers, Jesse's bike can leap into the 
air, and a well-timed spring can avoid a 
collision. A crash or a blast from a villain's gun 
is not fatal, as the bike can take a fair bit of 
damage before it is immobilized. Reckless driving 
is not tolerated, and if too many civilians are 
killed, the police will be in pursuit. If the 
police catches up with the bike, the game ends. 
However, the turbo facility can be used to make a 
quick getaway. 
 
After driving along, the player needs to keep an 
eye on the gauges that indicate the condition of 
the lasers, the damage inflicted on the bike, and 
the engine temperature. Points are awarded for 
each of the villain's car blown up and for each 
civilian overtaken. While driving, Jesse receives 
a message regarding a break-in at the liquor 
store. It is up to him to take it slowly so that 
he can arrive there safely. 
 
At the liquor store, you must destroy three 
villains who run out of the store and attempt to 
escape in their getaway van. All of the villains 
must be shot before the second mission can begin. 
This mission involves another chase sequence, only 
this time a high bonus is awarded for killing off 
a major underworld figure who is driving a black 
sedan. Once the sedan gets destroyed, Jesse and 
his bike can return to base for a refit so the 
major confrontation with the leader can begin. To 
complete the game, the leader must be blown out of 
his Porsche.

Strike Aces is a flight simulator designed to give 
players a feel for the quick decision-making 
process that real pilots need to fly. It takes 
place at the Strategic Air Command Bombing and 
Navigation Competition, a real-life event that 
occurs every year at Ellsworth Air Force Base in 
South Dakota. The best aircrews from around the 
world and some of the best aircraft come to 
participate in a series of three missions that are 
constantly monitored, with points awarded to 
aircrews in various categories. In the end, the 
aircrew that has gained the post points receives 
the Curtis E. LeMay trophy. In this game, you are 
the pilot of one of these aircrews with a choice 
of flying one of six aircraft, and your missions 
will pit you against any of seven additional enemy 
aircraft (although you will not get to fly them). 
To practice flying, you can do a Free Flight

Strike Force Harrier (c) 1986 H&H&nbsp / 
Mirrorsoft Ltd. 
 
Rod Hyde was always determined to produce the most 
realistic and advanced flight simulations ever, 
and this early attempt at recreating the Harrier 
is an example of that. There are 3 skill levels, 
as well as two practice modes - one for the 
rudiments of flight and the other for combat. The 
action-centered nature of the title means that it 
can be seen as an advanced shoot 'em up rather 
than a pukka flight simulator. 
 
Acquiring a lock on enemy planes and tanks is made 
easier by the advanced targeting technology of the 
planes, and escaping enemy fire is aided by the 
vectored thrust system. Shooting out the tanks 
clears ground space to set up your own bases, 
which must then be defended. VTOL (vertical 
take-off and landing) is correctly implemented, 
although more traditional horizontal take-offs 
should be used when space permits. The full range 
of weapons are provided

Based on the 1989 Atari Games (not to be confused 
with Atari Corporation, producers of the Lynx) 
coin-op by Ed Rotberg.  It's 2492 and you must 
pilot your Sub-Terranean Underground Network 
(S.T.U.N.) craft at speeds over 900 miles per hour 
through a series of courses to retain your title 
as S.T.U.N. Runner, completing each course before 
time runs out. 
 
There are also enemies on each course, such as 
cycles, indestructible armored drones, and flying 
bird-like craft.  Shoot or avoid them.  If you hit 
them, you lose one of your shields (your craft has 
six total) and are slowed down temporarily.  The 
more shields you have at the finish line, the more 
bonus points you get.  Getting hit with no shields 
does not kill you, however.  There are no lives in 
this game.  The only way to lose is to fail to 
cross the finish line. 
 
Along the way you'll encounter Boost Pads that 
temporarily speed you up to incredible speeds and 
make you indestructible.  By running over enough 
green stars on each course, you can also earn 
Shockwaves, which destroy all enemies in your 
path. 
 
Note that there is no accelerator in this game.  
Your craft always goes full speed, unless you hit 
something.  Then you will slow down, but quickly 
accelerate back to full speed.  Other than that, 
you cannot slow down and the only way to speed up 
is to run over a Boost Pad.  Your only controls 
are steering left and right and aiming the gun on 
top of your craft up and down.

Subbuteo recreates the famous table football game, 
which makes for something very different from 
Sensible/Kick Off/FIFA style games. It's 
effectively a turn-based strategy game of sorts, 
as each player has 30 seconds to make their move 
(within a 30 minute match length), which involves 
first selecting a player, then aiming the 
direction in which he will be flicked, then the 
power and swerve of the flick are determined by 
the length of time the button is held down for. 
 
With any luck, your player will hit the ball, and 
hit it such that it doesn't leave the playing 
area, and doesn't hit an opponent. If any of those 
rules are violated, possession passes to the 
opposition. Before each flick, the team not in 
possession can make a 'defensive flick' involving 
moving one of their players into a potential 
blocking position (without hitting the ball or an 
opponent, as this is a foul).

action/strategy hybrid, which also features 
computer AI for a solo match on the C64 version 
(Spectrum owners can only practice plays on their 
own). When kicking, the player controls the kick's 
strength and accuracy by pressing fire, so the 
direction isn't under direct control, and punts 
can only be returned if they are caught on the 
full. 
 
When selecting the play, a distinction is made 
between long and short passing plays. You select 
the recipient when the ball is in play by moving 
the cursor which appears and pressing fire. If a 
catch is made, you can take control of any player, 
which needn't be the player running for the 
end-zone. Running and Special Teams plays are also 
on offer of course. 
 
When on the defense, the player has 4 main 
positional strategies to choose from, and can 
specify individual markers, and a player to simply 
track the ball carrier. Any individual player can 
be controlled once the action begins, and holding 
down fire allows you to change this player as the 
play unfolds.

they don't). These include upgraded weapons (the 
default one isn't especially powerful), and help 
such as magic staircases and a metal melter. Some 
sections of water kill you, other identical ones 
take you to different sections.

Super Cycle (c) 1986 Epyx, Inc. / U.S. Gold Ltd. 
 
A motorbike racing game strongly resembling Sega's 
Hang-On titles. The game is viewed from behind the 
bike, which tilts as you turn. You are racing 
against the clock, although there are lots of 
other bikes on track to avoid and ride around. 
There are 3 skill levels, which affect the amount 
of time you have to complete the level, and the 
bonus offered if you manage to (the amount of time 
left, divided by a set number, bigger on lower 
levels). Your bike has 3 gears and appears to have 
a top speed of around 120 MPH. After every 2 races 
there's a bonus round in which you must pick up as 
many tokens as possible in the time limit.

Super Hang On (c) 1987 SEGA Enterprises Ltd. / 
Electric Dreams Software 
 
This is a conversion of Sega's popular motorcycle 
racing arcade game.  In this game you race a 
motorcycle around the world, completing each 
section of track within a time limit. There are 
other bikes on the road, but beating this is not 
important, so they can be thought of as moving 
obstacles. Each continent is a different 
difficulty level: Africa is beginner, Asia is 
junior, the Americas are senior, and Europe is 
expert. 
 
This is a very simple and straightforward game, 
viewed from behind the bike in 2D (so the screen 
does not tilt with the bike). The right/left 
controls are steering, and up/down are gear 
changes. Your cycle is always moving, and your 
speed strictly depends on the gear you are in, 
although contact or running off the road slows the 
bike down.

Fruit Bank Supernudge 2000 (c) 1989 PAL 
Developments / Virgin Mastertronic Ltd. 
 
Super Nudge 2000 is a fruit machine simulator for 
one player. 
 
The game allows the player 10, 20 or 30 credits to 
start and when all credits have been used the 
player can, if their winnings are high enough, 
enter their name on a high-score table 
 
The machine has five reels. Reels 1-4 are game 
reels that spin to provide a winning or losing 
line. Reel five contains the numbers 0-5 and wt 
the end of each spin the corresponding number of 
lights in the SUPERNUDGE feature is lit. When all 
lights are lit the feature is activated. 
Reel five also has a 'SKILL' symbol which, if 
displayed, causes all unlit lights to flash and 
the player can activate the SUPERNUDGE feature by 
pressing the action key when all lights are lit. 
Randomly, after each spin, the game will retain 
the lit feature lights for the next spin. 
 
When a winning line is displayed the player must 
gamble the win for either a higher or lower win. 
If a higher win is achieved the process is 
repeated until the player either achieves the 
maximum win possible or fails to advance.

Super Pipeline 2 (c) 1985 Taskset Ltd. /

The follow-up to Super Pipeline adds new enemies 
and 16 levels. The player controlled the 
(white-suited) foreman in charge of keeping the 
pipeline flowing to fill a number of barrels 
(which increased on later levels, up to 3). Two 
types of enemy run onto the pipe - those that can 
make a hole (commonly drills, a blowtorch and the 
earthenware jug) and pests (spiders, lobsters and 
so on). Once a hole is made in the pipe, the 
foreman must guide a (green-suited) workman to the 
hole so it can be repaired. While the workman is 
mending the leak, he is vulnerable to being 
knocked off the pipe. 
 
The foreman is equipped with a gun to shoot 
enemies, but he can also be knocked off the pipe 
by the monsters. To make matters more complicated, 
the lobster can only be attacked from behind (due 
to its shell) and the "Shower of Tacks" on later 
levels cannot be shot at all.

Super Scramble Simulator recreates the sport of

to ride a motocross bike through hazardous courses

The game uses a split-screen display, with a big 
window viewed from the side as well as a 
longer-range aerial view - the latter is useful 
for dodging hazards to the left or right, as the 
side-view doesn't demonstrate these accurately. 
The bike has 3 gears, and you must use a low gear 
to go uphill. You will need to do wheelies to 
ensure good landings from the big jumps, and to 
clear divots in the ground.

Indoor Sports (c) 1987 DesignStar Consultants, 
Inc. / Advance Software Ltd. 
 
Four Indoor Sports are compiled in this entry to 
DesignStar's SportTime line of recreations. 
Ten-Pin Bowling, Air Hockey, Darts and (except on 
the Commodore 64) Ping Pong are featured. The 
menus and options screens have the same feel as 
Clubhouse Sports. Each game has computer opponents 
at multiple skill levels plus human-versus-human 
and demo modes, and matches can consist of varying 
numbers of rounds, with other options depending on 
the game. 
 
Ten-pin bowling is played from a side-on view, 
   although once the shot has been taken you see 
   the results unfold from the bowler's view. 
   There are three stages to taking a shot. Move 
   the player up and down to line up his run-up, 
   pressing fire to set the position. Then, do the 
   same to set the angle of the shot. Finally, 
   after pressing fire to start the run-up, press 
   it again to time the release of the ball, as 
   close to the line as possible. 
 
Darts has 4 skill and 3 speed levels, and players 
can play to 301, 501 or 701, to vary game length 
or provide a handicapping system. You can also set 
whether scoring must start or end with a double. 
Viewed from behind the board, you must first line 
up the dart, then set the dart's curvature and 
power by stopping a curved gauge on the right, 
then a rising power bar on the left. The view then 
changes twice - first a behind-the-player view to 
show the dart's approach, then a close-up of the 
board to show where it landed. 
 
Air Hockey plays for five minutes, or until 
someone has scored 12 points. The view is above 
the pitch but angled so as to emphasize the goal 
at the top. 
 
Ping-Pong features a handicapping system - six 
ability areas can be graded from 1-5, to ensure a 
closely-matched game. Again the view is from 
behind one court. To impart direction onto a shot, 
the angle must be pressed at the same time as the 
fire button.

Gary Lineker's Super Star Football (c) 1987 
SportTime / Gremlin Graphics Software Ltd. 
 
Much of the design and programming of Superstar 
Ice Hockey (by many of the same programmers) is 
revised to provide a six-a-side soccer game. You 
can control any combination of centre-forward, 
goalkeeper (on the C64) and manager. For much of 
the game you are merely the centre-forward as the 
action unfolds around you - don't be afraid to 
track back and help out. 
 
The ball sticks closely to a player, who can pass, 
shoot, head or bicycle-kick it. Goalkeepers are 
penalised for retaining possession for too long (a 
rule later adapted for use in real-life football). 
Match length can be between 6 and 90 minutes, by 
toggling the speed at which time moves. Fouls are 
fully implemented. 
 
Single matches can be played in the cassette 
version, but the disk version adds a full-season 
structure. 64 English teams are split into 4 
divisions of 16, with a season consisting of 
either 7 or 15 matches.

8 challenging zones of battle await you in your 
role as a tank driver. The game is viewed from 
above, with rotational control and forward/reverse 
power for the tank. The routes to travel along are 
narrow and varied, so some exploration is required 
– some paths are inevitably safer and faster than 
others. The walls are particularly useful as they 
are strong enough to deflect shots, so you can 
often attack from safe positions round a corner. 
 
Opposition includes gun turrets firing at you, 
enemy tanks and landmines. You start with a 
standard gun, which must be held down longer to 
take out tougher foes, but can collect smart bombs 
and shields. A first-person viewpoint section 
follows each of these sections, with the sighting 
under your control, and more helicopters and jeeps 
to take on.

Seen from a top-down perspective, The Survivors 
plays somewhat similar to Boulder Dash as the 
levels are filled with sand and rocks. Droid 1 is 
the only droid that can dig through the earth, 
Droid 2 can beam survivors to safety (by moving 
over them) and Droid 3 can push rocks (only one at 
a time). The goal in each of the seven levels is 
to rescue all survivors within the time limit, 
while paying attention not to trap or damage any 
of the droids. Removing sand or pushing around 
rocks might cause other rocks to fall down and 
crash the droids. There are also Guardian Droids 
whose circuits have been damaged by the nuclear 
fall-out, causing them to run rampant. They damage 
the players droids on contact.

Shape of tiles varies from big and small squares 
to triangles or hexagons. If tiles have no 
neighbor tiles you may take appropriate tiles from 
the pocket of the limited size to eliminate the 
rest of the tiles. Finishing the level, player 
will be transferred to the higher level if the 
results of the current level were high enough for 
such level. But to finish level successfully, 
player should acquire the certain number of points 
and to be qualified for the next level. The 
difficulty also raises and depends on quantity of 
colours, the shape of the tiles, and time limit 
presence. Undo moves are also present, but such 
moves decrease your final results. Game may be 
saved in progress and loaded later. 
 
Best scores and levels will be written in High

Sweevo's World (c) 1986 Gargoyle Games Ltd / 
Gargoyle Games Ltd 
 
The Self-Willed Extreme Environment Volitional 
Organism, or Sweevo for short, is a goofy-looking 
and generally incompetent robot. His world is 
Knutz' Folly, and it comprises almost 200 
isometric-viewed screens of danger and challenge, 
making for a game influenced by Knightlore, 
although it takes a less serious approach to the 
genre. Sweevo can enter the world through four 
different vertical levels, and must use lifts and 
holes to cross through these to solve many 
puzzles. 
 
You will meet some decidedly weird inhabitants. 
Most dangerous are the Dictators and Minxes - 
contact with these will drain Sweevo's energy, as 
will contact with water (he's a robot, remember). 
Energy can be recharged by scaring the Geese and 
picking up the tokens this reveals. The main score 
is a percentage, although several other totals are 
kept - most unusually 'Brownie Points', through 
contact with the brownies.

Switchblade (c) 1990 Core Design Ltd. / Gremlin 
Graphics Software Ltd. 
 
The Fireblade, sacred symbol of the ancient 
Switchblade clan, has been smashed into 16 pieces 
by the evil Havoc - but they say that a Hiro can 
save it, and as Hiro, you must retrieve the 16 
pieces and restore your people's pride. 
 
The gameplay is platform and ladders based, set 
both inside and outside. The layout of the 
territories becomes visible as you progress, and 
they can contain bonus weapons and secret rooms. 
Unlike the sequel you start without weaponry, and 
this is gained directly, rather than you 
collecting coins and trading them at shop 
sections. Holding down fire progressively builds 
up your fighting power.

SWIV was an original vertical scrolling shooter 
that was an unofficial follow-up to Sales Curve's 
hit conversion of the side scroller Tecmo arcade 
game Silkworm. 
 
One player controlled a helicopter and the other a 
jeep, with the jeep transforming into a boat when 
the vehicles passed over water. As well as a host 
of blaster fodder the game also included a 
mid-level enemy inspired by the "Goose" enemy from 
the earlier title Silkworm. Pieces of this enemy 
would fly onto the screen and assemble into one 
vehicle before commencing to fire at the players' 
vehicles. When destroyed the "goose" would drop 
power-ups.

Swords and Sorcery (c) 1986 
 
The catacombs of Zob are believed to contain 
untold wealth and fortune, and this is enough to 
tempt you. That means entering an imposing dungeon 
filled with strange foes - Mages, Servants of Set, 
Revenent Guardians and many more. After taking 14 
days of training to build up your skills, or 
taking the default combinations, your magic and 
swordplay must face the challenge. 
 
Swords and Sorcery is a dungeon-crawler that uses 
the proprietary MIDAS system to present a 
first-person visual representation of your 
position, in a manner similar to Bard's Tale. This 
is on the left of the screen, with a map of your 
surroundings on the right, and text messages 
detailing your current situation below. 
 
Below even that are the menus, which are activated 
by moving a highlight bar left and right before 
selecting the correct option. Enemies you meet can 
be threatened, bribed or grovelled to. You can 
activate any spells you collect, including 
un-poison, weaken enemy, and freeze enemy. 
 
Watch out for magical barriers and traps, and use 
the transporters to your advantage. When you 
encounter magic would will have to test it to 
determine its use or detriment. 
 
The Armour of Zob is split into several pieces, 
which would will hopefully find on your quest. 
There are also extra swords and shields to 
collect, plus some treasure as a reward.

Promoted to a rank of Senior Sergeant of 
Investigations Brigade in Saint-Etienne (Loire), 
you've already proved yourself in L'affaire Vera 
Cruz (The Vera Cruz Affair). Your chiefs rest all 
their hopes upon your abilities and commit a new 
case to you, L'affaire Sydney (The Sydney Affair). 
 
Mr. James Sydney has just been shot in the 
    head. The assassin, who fired from the 
    opposite building, should know the habits of 
    the victim, because (s)he spent all the day at 
    the same place there... So you go with your 
    team to the crime scene to collect the clues 
    and follow the possible traces. 
 
The game as its predecessor flows in two parts: 
crime scene investigation to collect the evidence, 
and work with telex machine to gain information 
about possible suspects. 
 
The crime scene now includes two screens (street 
with Sydney's body and assassin's apartment). You 
should collect all possible evidence moving the 
marker on the screen and examining the objects 
scattered at the scenes as well as the body 
itself. 
 
With telex machine you should perform 
investigation according to the police procedures. 
Different actions are possible here such as 
sending messages within Diamond Network to receive 
the replies, printing the notes, contacting other 
Police services to gain the new information, 
comparing the evidences, carrying out examinations 
such as autopsy, interviewing/checking the alibis 
of suspects, and arresting finally. To specify the 
subject for each action you should type it.

Target Plus requires that you have the Gun Stick

options will be selected with a shot as well. 
 
This game consists of two parts which can be 
played independently, all of being related to aim 
shooting. The second part does include a 1 or 2 
players mode. 
 
In the first part you will have to shot at plates 
flying in the air, accounting for a total of 12, 
if you hit at least 6 the you will pass to the 
next round of this first part. You have 3 shots 
for every two plates, so you have to be effective 
on a regular basis. Once you have passed this 
round, you will have to aim at a total of 7 
targets, your goal is to hit at least 3 of them, 
here you only have one shot available for each 
objective. If you are lucky enough, the stage will 
be restarted with increased difficulty. 
 
In the second part of the game your objective will 
be to protect a juicy cooked chicken to be 
mercilessly attacked by spiders or voracious wasps 
that emerge from everywhere. Your mission would be 
to shot at them before they can absorb its 
substance till just leaving the bones. But it will 
not be easy, as time goes on insects will be more 
numerous, so if you find it pertinent, you can 
request the help from a second player. Do not let 
them spoil your dish...

Tarzan (c) 1986 Martech / Martech 
 
According to African legend, a human baby was 
abandoned in the forest. Found and brought up by a 
she-ape named Kala, he grew to learn the ways of 
the jungle and the language of the beasts. Years 
later, as John Clayton, Lord of Greystoke, he was 
brought back to England to claim his rightful 
inheritance. However, he occasionally returns to 
the wild to become Tarzan, Lord of the Jungle. 
 
Now is one of those occasions. Tarzan has returned 
to the jungle with his wife, Lady Jane Greystoke, 
but their holiday came to an end when Usanga, evil 
chief of the Wamabo, kidnaps Jane to force Tarzan 
into retrieving the seven gemstones that were 
stolen from his tribal shrine. These gemstones are 
believed to be the Eyes of the Rainbow, 
representing each color of the spectrum. Tarzan 
has been given three days to find the gemstones, 
otherwise Jane will be eaten by the tribal pet, 
Sheeta the Panther. 
 
After consulting his information sources, Tarzan 
learns that the Eyes of the Rainbow have been 
scattered around the dense jungle by a family of 
pesky chimps. Tarzan's quest involves navigating 
dark caves, crevasses, swamps, and treacherous 
quicksand. 
 
Objects, such as the rope and torch, need to be 
found if Tarzan wants to find each gemstone. 
Throughout the quest, hazards such asheadhunters, 
lions, snakes, spiders, quicksands, and pits are 
encountered. If Tarzan comes into contact with any 
of these hazards, he becomes stunned for an hour 
and the on-screen timer shrinks accordingly. 
Fortunately, he can punch creatures, allowing him 
to escape them. 
 
If Tarzan manages to find all seven gemstones 
within the time limit and deliver them to Usanga, 
Jane will be released. If not, she will become 
nothing more than another bowl of jungle soup.

energy from Ted's single life. 
 
Ted has 21 tasks to complete in this 8 1/2 
hour-day, but it is largely up to him to find out 
what they are, and which order to do them in. The 
full day includes trips to the canteen, 
photocopier, power generator and the boss' office 
- logic will give you clues as to when these are 
to be accomplished. 
 
He knows that solving one problem can change the 
nature of another, due to the program's advanced

must be hit, sometimes within a time limit, and 
Ted knows the location of the first few of these.

With April O'Neil held hostage by The Shredder's

to the Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles to come to her 
rescue!  Play as all four of the turtle heroes, 
rescue April, and then rescue your sensei Splinter 
from Mecha-Turtles clutches than go after The 
Shredder deep in the bowels of The Technodrome 
itself. 
 
Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles is an action game 
based on the late eighties/early nineties cartoon 
series of the same name. Play as Leonardo, 
Michaelangelo, Donatello and Raphael (one turtle 
only, but the ability to swap between turtles at 
any time) as you save your friends and battle The 
Shredder and his cronies. There are no 'lives', as 
such - when you lose a turtle, he becomes 
'captured', and you cannot use him again until you 
rescue him from a place hidden in the overworld. 
 
Gameplay takes place in two perspectives: a 
top-down view, which lets you run around and 
explore buildings, sewers and other places. When 
entering places from the top-down view, the 
perspective shifts to a side-scrolling view, where 
most of the battling takes place. In addition to 
each turtle's main weapon, sub-weapons (such as 
shuriken) can be acquired, to use at foes - these 
have a limited use.

April O'Neil, the reporter friend of the Teenage

villainous Shredder and his two goons, Bebop and 
Rocksteady. The four ninja turtles: Raphael, 
Michelangelo, Donatello and Leonardo fight their 
way through hordes of Foot Soldiers in order to 
rescue April. They battle familiar foes such as 
the mad scientist Baxter Stockman, General Traag 
from Dimension X and the evil alien brain Krang, 
up to the final showdown with Shredder himself. 
 
Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles: The Arcade Game is a 
port of the popular arcade game made by Konami 
during the height of the cartoon series' 
popularity. Depending on the version of the game, 
up to two, three or four players can take part in 
the action. The game plays like a simplified 
Double Dragon. While most of the standard Foot 
Soldier enemies are easily dispatched, some attack 
with knives or ray guns and are thus more 
dangerous. At the end of each level, players 
encounter a boss (or in certain cases two bosses 
working in tandem, such as Bebop and Rocksteady). 
 
The NES version of the game features additional 
content not present in other versions of the game: 
two new levels (Snowy Central Park and The Dojo), 
new bosses (including Tora, Shogun and Baxter 
Stockman as a fly), additional music tracks as 
well as more variations of Foot Soldiers.

both yourself and the aliens. You remain on the 
outside and keep shooting as the aliens move 
towards you. Any that reach the outside are fatal 
to touch, thus limiting your range of movement 
greatly if 2 or more achieve this. Some aliens 
move sideways - in dealing with these, plan ahead 
allowing for the time your shots to take to 
travel. 
 
You have a Super Zapper, which can be used once on 
each level to wipe out all aliens currently 
active, but this scores no points.

Ten-Pin Challenge (c) 1987 
 
Tenpin Challenge was a budget choice for ten-pin 
bowling enthusiasts to play the game at home. Up 
to four players can take part, with a choice of 
five ball weights. The computer does the scoring 
automatically, taking bonus points for strikes and 
spares into account. Your high scores can be saved 
to cassette. 
 
Taking a shot has three stages. First you must aim 
the shot  by moving a cursor left and right. then, 
you must set the spin, by stopping a spinning 
diagram as it quickly moves through the 360 
degrees. Finally you set the pace, by holding down 
the 'a' key for the right length of time, with no 
power gauge to guide you. Once this is done you 
will see the shot outcome, with a split screen 
showing the ball moving sideways at first, and 
then towards (and hopefully into) the bunch of 
pins, which are then moved and replaced as 
necessary.

The game is structured similarly to a real

the results of each bowl) loads before the main 
game. 
 
By default the game features England and 
Australia, although you can manually type in 
different team names. Before each over the bowling 
team must choose their bowler, while the batting 
team chooses its two opening players, and which 
play should come in after each dismissal. Both 
batsmen and bowlers are number in descending order 
of ability. The action is viewed form above, and 
when a shot is played the batting team must decide 
whether to run or not - after each run the 
positions are updated and the decision made again.

choose to be the supreme commander of the NATO or 
the Warsaw Pact. In your control are air and 
ground units. These are backed up by your ability 
to make strategic nuclear/chemical attacks. 
 
As the Warsaw Pact commander your task is to break 
the lines of the NATO alliance, which you see is a 
powerful invasion force, poised on your border. 
Your first task is to take over West Germany. 
 
As NATO commander your task is to stop the Russian 
invasion. Hold the lines on West Germany's border. 
You will achieve this by preventing the occupation 
of West Germany. 
 
Your computer opponent can play in three different 
ways. Nuclear weapons can be disabled for a 
Beginner game, while the thought processes can be 
either rational or unpredictable. 
 
Gameplay is turn-based and primarily strategic, 
but some scenes can be played out in optional 
action sequences.

In They Stole a Million you are The Boss, a 
would-be criminal mastermind out to seek his 
fortune the dishonest way. To do this you will 
have to hire a team of criminals, with skills 
ranging from explosives to driving - these will 
each seek an upfront payment and a percentage cut 
of the eventual profits. You will have to buy 
information and plans on potential targets - an 
art gallery and bank for example. Menu options 
reveal pop-up windows of information and 
sub-menus. 
 
Planning the raid itself is your next task. An 
overhead view of the site is prevented, with your 
information on doors and storage locations all 
readily available. You move each member around the 
map to give them orders, using a displayed clock 
to ensure that the action timings overlap 
correctly. Many options bring up sub-menus of 
icons. 
 
During the actual crime, you wait outside, with a 
walkie-talkie to issue orders. Keep an eye out for 
police cars, as their presence may for you to 
freeze, or run off with what you have so far. You 
can enter the site to help out, but this leaves 
you defenceless if the police arrive.

by switches, and the last of these switches locks 
the level-ending lift. 
 
Thing on a Spring is a platform game, made unusual 
by Thing's motion method. He can bounce to reach 
great heights, and be bounced off platforms 
strategically to reach higher platforms. You have 
limited oil, which is lost through contact with 
the many nasties you will encounter.

at you in large hordes. Once you get to the indoor 
sections you will find big enemies with the 
ability to kill you with one hit, in sections set 
on multiple levels complete with stairways.

Times of Lore (c) 1990 ORIGIN Systems, Inc. / 
MicroProse Ltd. 
 
A simple action-RPG following the adventures of a 
young warrior (strong barbarian, armored knight, 
or quick valkyrie) to assist a weakened kingdom 
from various threats, and to recover special 
Artifacts that once made the kingdom strong. 
 
Gameplay consists of moving your character in 
real-time through various terrains, like forests, 
towns, and dungeons. The player gathers basic 
items, like health and magic potions, and 
increasingly powerful weapons as you progress 
through the story. Conversations are handled 
through keyphrases. Combat is real-time as well, 
against a few types of creatures (skeletons, orcs, 
rogues) of which there can be various flavors.

Timetrax (c) 1986 Binary Design, Ltd. / Argus 
Press Software Ltd. 
 
Dark forces have set out to destroy the fabric of 
time, by opening eight space-time continuum 
portals. Each one is guarded by a great mind, who 
must have a relevant object returned to them 
before they will allow you to seal the portals. 
Doing this requires formulating a spell from the 
runes the Minds give you. 
 
All of this is played out in a combination of 
side-view action and icon-based object 
manipulation. Starting in your living room as you 
search for a weapon and its bullets, you move 
along a network of levels and ladders, avoiding or 
shooting the many foes you encounter. Pressing 
down and fire together brings up a menu allowing 
you to pick up items, swap them with Guardians, 
and cast spells (with the chance to test them 
first).

Tir Na Nog (c) 1986 Gargoyle Games Ltd / Gargoyle 
Games Ltd 
 
The first of a trilogy of similarly-designed 
titles from Gargoyle Games, Tir Na Nog is a 
complex mix of arcade and adventure elements done 
in an innovative way. The game is viewed from the 
side, and to change direction you must rotate the 
view. 
 
You play Cuchulainn, and you must restore the 
Sidhe race to its former position of intelligence, 
enlightenment and civilization. This can be done 
by retrieving the four pieces of the Seal of 
Calum, which was shattered when the Great Enemy 
invaded. 
 
Many puzzles are presented in the form of cryptic 
text messages (displayed in a neat pseudo-Celtic 
font), ranging form 'find my crown for a gift' to 
'The backdoor key is me' - lateral thinking is 
required to interpret these messages. 
 
The action side of things is challenging, 
especially before you have found a good sword or 
mace. When you die, you return to the start of the 
game, but the settings of objects are left exactly 
as they were - making it important to regularly 
save the game, as it's possible to lose weaponry 
in a situation so precarious that you have little 
chance of retrieving it without suffering more 
combat.

Titanic Blinky (c) 1992 Zeppelin Games Limited / 
Zeppelin Games Limited 
 
Arthur J. Hackensack, an insane Texas billionaire 
bent on conquering the world, kidnaps professor 
Frobisher Goonhilly, a paranormal scientist 
working on a matter transformation weapon. As a 
demonstration of its powers, Arthur transforms the 
Isle of White into a giant custard slice, New York 
into a bath sponge and the Eiffel Tower into a 
toast rack. The ghost Blinky, secret agent for 
S.P.E.C.T.R.E. (Society for the Prevention of 
Ectoplasmic Crime, Telekinetic misuse and Reality 
Endangerment), infiltrates the madman's sea ship 
(the newly raised SS Titanic) armed with an 
ectoplasmic gun and a case full of disguises. 
 
Titanic Blinky is a platform adventure and a clone 
of Dizzy, replacing the egg protagonist with a 
slightly effeminate ghost. As in that game, the 
aim is to collect objects (by pulling down on the 
movement controls) to solve puzzles. One main 
difference from Dizzy is the fact that Blinky 
carries a gun with infinite ammunition. There's an 
energy bar at the bottom of the screen that gets 
depleted every time Blinky touches an enemy. When 
it's empty, Blinky literally flips over and the 
player loses one life. The game starts with three 
lives, and there's no form of saving progress.

crazy scientist, in this case called Dr Acid, who 
kidnaps the hero's girlfriend with the intention

In order to accomplish it, he will have to face 
four different levels in which all kind of tiny 
beasts will try to cut his way. Thus, on the first 
stage, the disco, he will have to avoid some crude 
dudes, siphons, drinks which fall from above, 
etc., whereas he desperately looks for the eight 
plates that will allow the access to the next 
levels, which are: the beach, the pirate ship, and 
finally, the Acid House.

Flight simulation specialists Digital Integration 
turned their attention to helicopter flight in 
this recreation of the AH-64 Apache. All the 
controls are realistically simulated, so the 
airspeed is dependent on the height of the 
vehicle, and you can move horizontally using the 
rudder option as well as rolling left and right. 
If using a Sinclair joystick interface you can use 
both ports to have all these controls accessible 
on dual joysticks, just like the real thing. 
Either way, a full instrument panel allows 
monitoring of these. 
 
You are armed with cannons, rockets and anti-tank 
missiles, each of which has its target set up 
independently, but only one can be loaded at once. 
Flight options include day/night, clear/cloudy and 
air turbulence on/off, allowing beginners and 
experts to find a suitable setting. Scenery 
includes trees, mountains and pylons, while enemy 
targets include helicopters, turrets and tanks.

scenes mainly require you to collect some items 
before leaving the level. You have only one chance 
to complete the current level, which means that if 
your energy is lost, the game ends. Energy is lost 
if you are attacked by an obstacle, or if you are 
shot at by an enemy. You can gain more energy by 
either collecting some pills or a heart, depending

Tournament Tennis (c) 1985 D&L&nbsp / Psion 
Software Ltd. 
 
Most of the conventions that became standard for 
tennis simulations appear in this early title - 
indeed many were pioneered by it. Matches can be 
played at quarter-final, semi-final or final level 
- winning at one level automatically moves you 
onto the next one. They can last for 3 or 5 sets, 
with a player requiring a 2-game lead to win a 
set, although a tie-break comes in at 6-6 in all 
but the final set. 
 
The view is pseudo-3D, from above the court, and 
features a shadow on the ball to give a more 
realistic appearance and make it easier to judge 
its height. Spectators turn their heads to view 
the action, and ball-boys run on to the court to 
retrieve a dead ball. Shot speed, direction and 
spin can all be applied, and forehand and backhand 
strokes are both available.

Nebulus (c) 1988 Hewson Consultants Ltd. / Hewson

You play a small green guy who needs to blow up 
eight towers, because their presence is somehow 
poisoning the water of planets which could 
potentially be ideal colonies. Unfortunately you 
need to get to the top of these towers to blow 
them up. 
 
You make your way up to the top of the tower via 
walkways around the outside of the towers. You 
need to jump over, kick, and run from various 
enemies in your journey to the top. Most vertical 
movement is achieved by jumping onto moving ledges 
at the right moment. 
 
The game was considered revolutionary in its time 
for its graphic technique. As the main character 
walked around the outside of the tower, the 
character was fixed in the middle of the screen 
while the tower itself rotated. This gave it a 
pseudo-3D effect. 
 
Towers are linked together via a voyage through 
the sea in your trusty MK.7 submarine. This plays 
out as a side-scrolling collect-'em-up in which 
bonus points can be obtained.

Toyota Celica GT Rally (c) 1991 Gremlin Graphics

A detailed recreation of rallying licensed from 
Toyota Great Britain. Driving on gravel, asphalt 
and ice is involved, with each race made up of a 
series of short stages to complete. After each 
stage, your times are compared with those of your 
rivals, whose names are subtly changed from the 
real drivers of the day. Up to four human players 
can be involved, taking it in turns. 
 
As visibility is sometimes low, and the exact 
curvature of a corner isn't always obvious from 
the apex, a co-driver is provided to give pace 
notes. These can be adjusted before you take to 
the track, specifying what is defined as 'hard 
left' and how early the warning should be given. 
 
The steering sensitivity can be adjusted, and you

Tracksuit Manager (c) 1988 Goliath Games / Goliath 
Games 
 
Tracksuit Manager varied the conventional Football 
Manager game style in a number of ways. You take 
charge of an international team aiming to qualify 
for and then play in the European Championships 
and World Cup. This means there is no transfer 
market, just a pool of 100 eligible players from 
which a squad of 22 is selected. You can view 
reports on each player's ability and form at any 
stage of the squad and team selection process. You 
can arrange friendly matches to try out players 
and ensure that the squad plays together as much 
as possible. 
 
The matches are presented as a running commentary, 
with a small graphic indicating which area of the 
pitch the ball is in. A wide range of tactical 
options are available to dictate the team's 
passing style, defensive approach and so on, and 
in another first you can give specific 
instructions to individual players (maybe telling 
a particularly pacy defender to man-mark a 
dangerous opposition winger instead of staying in 
a set position).

Traffic is a simple game where the player has to

the next level is to get a preset number of 
vehicles through the screen, although it does not 
matter which exit you direct them through. Cars 
continue to queue off the edges of the screen 
(with numbers next to them if there are queued 
cars beyond your vision) and if the queue reach 
more than five cars, it's game over. A warning 
sound is given when five cars are queued

An imaginative action game in which you must guide 
a ball-shaped craft through a succession of 
levels. These have a patchwork-quilt type display, 
with holes to avoid, and squares of various 
colors, which affect the craft's speed, both 
within its power potential and into warp, as well 
as a control-reverser and lots of holes. You can 
jump these holes by pressing fire, although you 
have a limited number of these for each level, and 
adjust the speed by pulling the joystick forward 
or backwards.  You face a time limit on each of 
the 21 levels, although your time is boosted every 
time you complete one. A simultaneous 2-player 
mode is included, similar to the split-screen mode 
in the Lotus games (by the same authors).

Normandy and Allied control. 
 
Once in control of the train, you must set the

steam is released when necessary. Use the provided 
map, and the communications network once released, 
to plan the strategic side of your mission. Each 
station has coal and water supplies which may be 
needed to keep the train running. 
 
You must raid railway stations in order to get 
track switches into the right position. Both this 
and the initial capture of the train involve 
aiming at the enemy, current indicated point, and 
ducking before their bullets can hit you. Taking 
control of bridges is similar - you control a

Trapdoor, The (c) 1986 
 
Berk is trying to obtain a chest of treasure from 
within a castle inhabited by the Bad Tempered 
Thing. This involves completing five tasks, 
although a learner mode in which only 4 are 
required is also provided. The first task is to 
provide a can of worms, whilst crushed eyeballs 
must be provided for task two. You then need to 
boil Slimies, fry eggs (getting them is a dilemma 
in itself), and then force everything back into 
the trapdoor. These tasks must be completed before 
Thing’s Angry Meter reaches its limit. 
 
As fans of the TV show will recall, the Trap Door 
of the title seals in numerous strange monsters, 
and in the game some are harmful and some are a 
hindrance, depending on the task at hand, so be 
careful which ones are released. Remember to close 
it, as spooks will be released if you do not – 
these require food to be pacified. Boni and Drutt 
appear regularly – the former giving cryptic 
morsels of advice, and the latter eating spiders 
and getting in the way. You can prepare for one 
task while completing another, so pay attention to 
items which may be useful, and think about what 
they are likely to be used in conjunction with.

While few young people aspire to the role of a 
Dustman, New Generation Software felt they would 
enjoy pretending to be one on this innovative 
arcade game. 
 
Each section presents you with a road of houses, 
drawn from forced-perspective 3D, with 
flick-scrolling as you move up the road. Each 
house's dustbin must be collected, emptied and 
replaced within the time limit, which is indicated 
by the Bonus timer at the top of the screen. If 
this reaches zero, you receive the first of 3 
warnings -  a third sees you out of a job. 
 
Setting foot on the grass causes the onus to drop 
more quickly, and there are additional hazards to 
avoid, including the local cars, which appear to 
be driven by maniacs, and cyclists and barking 
dogs, which can both injure you and cause your 
movement to slow.

Trivial Pursuit (c) 1987 Oxford Digital 
Enterprises Ltd. / Domark Software, Inc. 
 
This is the earliest home computer incarnation of 
Horn Abbot International Ltd's classic board game, 
Trivial Pursuit. The game involves answering 
questions on one of six subject categories to gain 
moves, and answering questions on special squares 
to gain one of the six 'Wedges' you need to gain 
the right to take on the final winning question. 
Questions are aimed at British players - many 
entertainment questions are based on British TV, 
and sport questions relate to popular British 
sports. 
 
Two game modes are available:- single player 
(which involves answering questions against the 
clock) and multiplayer (where you can take on up 
to five human-controlled players). The computer 
reveals the answer, and you select 'yes' or 'no' 
to tell it whether you got it right. 
 
The question categories are exactly the same as 
the board game, however two different question 
styles are added to take advantage of computer 
technology - some questions relate to a picture or 
diagram and some relate to a piece of music. 
 
One additional feature not available in the board 
game is a statistical analysis of the number and 
type of questions answered correctly. This can be 
split into the performances of all the players, or 
the performance of an individual player within the 
six categories. It is especially useful at the end 
of the game, when choosing which category a player 
must answer to win the game.

Trivial Pursuit - A New Beginning (c) 1988 Oxford 
Mobius / Domark Software, Inc. 
 
After recreating the original board game as 
closely as possible with the first licensed game, 
Oxford did something different with the sequel. 
Each player now controls a spaceship, and the 
overall aim is to convince the Elders of the 
planet Genus  to accept your people's plan to 
colonize it. 
 
The Elders are all located in different parts of 
the galaxy, and can only be reached by travelling 
through the galaxy answering questions correctly, 
and answering a specific question once you get 
there. As a result, the gameplay isn't vastly 
different from the original. 
 
The six question categories are the same as the 
original, and there are 50 levels of question to 
clear, but the big difference is that the question 
category is random, so players who are only 
knowledgeable in one or two areas are no longer at 
an advantage.

Life has never been too quiet in Marrakesh, but 
lately things have been getting harder.  Ait-Amar, 
the daughter of the sultan, has been kidnapped by 
a group of Berbers and they are forcing him to 
give half of his fortune within three days. 
 
But as you know, with every kidnapping of a 
princess there's always an hero ready to rescue 
her, and Ben-Yussef, our protagonist, has been the 
chosen one this time to get into the labyrinthine 
and dangerous Kasbah in order to affront the 
kidnappers and rescue the handsome daughter of the 
Sultan. 
 
As expected, it will be a hard task, because 
although there are some local residents willing to 
give clues in exchange for some coins, others will 
try to steal everything they can. Besides these 
two types of Moors, deep in the Kasbah there are 
women to which you can steal their money, 
policemen that will take your weapons, and thugs 
who are at the doors of the houses that you must 
enter in order to find the princess. 
 
Like any human being, Ben-Yussef must replenish 
his strength in inns and restaurants and rest in 
hotels or hostels, implying a significant economic 
outlay. You can also buy new weapons in the 
armouries prepared to this effect, bearing in mind 
that depending on the neighborhood, these elements 
may also vary in price.

causes you to spin but does not affect your rival, 
although side-on contact is usually beneficial. 
There are hazards off the track to avoid, and

A map is built into the car, which can instantly

them leave and try again another time. 
 
The game's environment is large and varied, with 
traffic lights, junctions and zebra crossings 
accurately implemented, and pedestrians to avoid. 
The roads are multi-laned, and at the end of each 
road you can turn across, which makes the game's

Limited weaponry can be collected, although 
jumping on the heads of these foes will also kill

Turrican II: The Final Fight is a

Its plot is - naturally - very simple: an evil 
mega-robot called The Machine attacks the United 
Planets Ship Avalon 1, slaughtering all who 
resist. All - except Bren McGuire, who manages to 
escape and slips into the experimental Turrican 
bionic armor. As Turrican, he strives to show The 
Machine who's the boss. 
 
Unlike other games of its type, this game contains 
three levels of horizontal shooter action in the 
spirit of R-Type or the developers' own Katakis. 
Six large worlds are to be explored, where you are 
basically free to go everywhere you want, since 
there is no automatic scrolling and the levels are 
packed with hidden extra lives and weapons. All 
those levels are very different: the first one in 
the rock desert is pretty colorful with 
parallaxing rainbow background and happy music, 
while the following worlds get darker and darker. 
 
Turrican can get some different weapons for his 
arm cannon: 
 
1. The bounce weapon which rebounds from 
   surfaces into smaller bouncing balls when

desert, an underground network of caves, and a 
tough tribal jungle. The natives are hostile to 
your presence, and weaponry must be found to fend 
them off, although its use does little to put the

through the jungle is equally important. At many 
other points you will need to use objects you have

shattering their magical amulet. By computer game 
plot standards he did a good job - only one of the 
family survived, and the amulet was broken into 23 
pieces. 
 
As Ulopa, the sole survivor, you must reclaim the 
pieces. They are spread across 23 levels of

some underground tunnels. The levels are of course 
packed with monsters. You have 3 types of weapons

Uchi-Mata Judo (c) 1987 Martech / Martech 
 
Uchi Mata is a unique tournament-based Judo 
fighting game in which you play as a judoka in the 
ultimate tournament. 
 
The game is played from a non-scrolling side view. 
You control your fighter and attempt to get within 
striking distance of your opponent, however you 
don't attack directly with your attack button. 
Instead, your attack command puts you in a 
fighting stance that allows you to input a series 
of directional moves. That, combined with the 
correct feet placement of both fighters (which can 
be seen in a helpful window) allows you to unleash 
specific throws and offensive maneuvers that form 
the basis of the combat in the game. A stamina and 
health bar also keep your attacks in check, as you 
may need to rest and build up your strength in 
order to perform effective attacks.

Une affaire en or (c) 1985 Free Games Blot / Free 
Games Blot 
 
Une affaire en or (a golden opportunity, or 
something like that) is a business simulation for 
up to four players. You are the new director of 
the "Apples Company", and your goal is to turn the 
company into Europe's biggest player in the apple 
compote industry. 
 
You start out with a capital of 15 million francs, 
for which you must buy factory capacity, energy, 
apples and hire a workforce. You have four 
different energy alternatives, ranging from atom 
energy to coal, petrol or gas. Atom energy is 
expensive but secure, whereas your energy supply 
can get interrupted by wars in the Middle East if 
you rely on petrol, and the other alternatives 
also fluctuate in price and supply. After having 
bought energy and supplies, you can start 
production. Your production capacity per turn is 
calculated based on the size of your factory in 
relation to your labour force. Being a French 
labour force, strikes can halt production for 
certain turns, and mood swings will bring down 
productivity as well. 
 
Production cannot proceed without a supply of 
apples, and accidents in your warehouse may force 
you into the market to buy fresh ingredients. 
Apples can be bought in your own region, from all 
of France, or from the EEC market. Supply is 
limited, and may be brought down by bad weather. 
 
For selling your stock, you need a dealer network, 
either on a national or European level. The market 
prices fluctuate, and can be saturated by cheap 
"made in Hong-Kong" goods, halting trading for one 
turn or more. Sometimes, the state will cease your 
stock and pay only half price for it. However, the 
state also tends to give you subsidies for 
investments. 
 
The game is won by saturating the markets, both 
domestic and export. Gameplay takes place on a 
screen filled with graphs and a cursor-based menu, 
triggering action dialogues. Five actions can be 
taken per turn, and each turn is ended by entering 
the production phase.

V - The Visitors (c) 1986 Kaos / Ocean 
    Software Ltd. 
 
There were two popular sci-fi television 
miniseries called V in 1983 and V: The Final 
Battle in 1984 which led to one season of a 
television weekly series also in 1984-1985.  The 
plot involved an alien invasion of Earth by a 
reptilian race known as "The Visitors".  In this 
game, you play as Mike Donovan, a resistance 
leader who enters the visitors' huge spaceship in 
order to blow up its reactor by setting explosives 
at key points. 
 
The aliens will try to stop you as will 
surveillance, cleaner, maintenance, and security 
robots.   If you touch any robots or are shot by 
them, a static charge will cause your hearbeat to 
increase.  If this happens several times you have 
to rest or it could kill you.  In 8 different 
laboratories you will find formulas for Red Dust 
which is lethal to the aliens - releasing it into 
air purification plants will kill many of them and 
also slow the robots. You can use a laser or when 
its charge runs out, you can jump over or roll 
under enemies. 
 
The gamescreen has three sections. The middle and 
upper are corridors you are going through and one 
above or below you. The bottom of the screen is a 
communiputer with various sections. One allows you 
to monitor the aliens' messages and to send 
messages of your own to confuse them

Throughout 95 horrifying rooms you will be 
besieged by his slaves, try to avoid them and

you reunite the 5 keys and you introduce them in 
its 5 corresponding bolts you would have done a

obtain each key you must find a certain object and 
fix it in the "generator by pedals", if you do it 
well you will be able to jump the enormous pit. 
The second part of your mission consists in 
opening the 6 magical counter-windows pressing the 
suitable switches. Finally, search for the hammer 
and the stake and walk quickly to the superior

Vector Ball (c) 1988 Binary Design, Ltd. / 
Mastertronic Ltd. 
 
This one on one future sport combines ideas from a 
number of real-world competitions, most notably 
the schoolgirl favourite Netball (I wonder why the 
ad blurb makes no mention of this?). The action is 
viewed isometrically, so moving the joystick up 
moves your droid north-east, down moves 
south-west, and so on. 
 
The aim is to score more points than your opponent 
in each match, and be the first to win four 
matches (against either a human or computer 
opponent), before moving up to the next difficulty 
level. There is a goal in the middle at each end, 
and the ball can be advanced by shooting it (the 
length of a shot is affected by pushing the 
joystick up or down with fire pressed) as you 
can't run with the ball, or hold onto it for long. 
The main novel idea in the game is the shaping of 
the pitches, which are viewed in full 3D and have 
bumps and big divots all around.

VENOM Strikes Back is a single player side 
scrolling, two dimensional, shoot-em-up. It is the 
third game to be based on the popular MASK comics, 
TV series, and books of the mid 1980's. 
 
The M.A.S.K., Mobile Armored Strike Kommand, 
organisation led by Matt Trakker, are battling the 
criminal organization known as V.E.N.O.M., Vicious 
Evil Network of Mayhem. Combat in the previous two 
games has been based around the transformer like 
vehicles used by M.A.S.K., not so in this game. 
In this game Matt's son has been kidnapped by 
V.E.N.O.M. and has been taken to the moon. Matt 
has been given an ultimatum, disband M.A.S.K. and 
leave the world at the mercy of V.E.N.O.M., or 
never see his son alive again. 
 
Matt sets out for the moon where he must overcome 
the defences of V.E.N.O.M.'s base, rescue his son 
and steal a rocket back to earth. 
In his quest he is helped by special masks that 
give him special powers. For example one mask will 
give Matt the ability to shoot bullets others will 
allow him to fly, pass through solid objects, 
float across bodies of water, have temporary 
invulnerability and so on. However, Matt can only 
carry four masks and can only use one mask at a 
time. Each mask has just 99 units of energy, or 
bullets, and this number is reduced each time the 
mask is used so eventually the mask will need 
replacing. 
 
At the end of each level as Matt progresses to the 
next the player gets a code word. This codeword 
can be typed in when the game is re-loaded 
allowing the player to restart at the new level.

All centers around Walther von Grünschild, a rich 
merchant and patron of the arts from Berlin, whose 
art collection was stolen. Now he sends his four 
nephews into the world to regain his paintings. 
The most successful of them becomes his heir. The 
game starts in 1918 and ends when von Grünschild 
dies. One round equals one day. The length of a 
round can be chosen between five seconds and 
infinite. 
 
In auctions the missing pictures are sold from 
time to time. But to buy them the player obviously 
needs money. This is gained by opening up to 24 
plantations in the Third World. There the player 
either grows coffee, cacao, tea or tobacco. After 
the harvesting the goods get shipped to warehouses 
in New York or London where the player sells it to 
interested companies. The player has to be on-site 
for every action which means an important part of 
the game is to plan ahead where he has to go 
during the next days. Another way to win money is 
gambling at horse races. 
 
Besides his business the player can visit art 
schools to gain the ability to distinguish real 
paintings from fake ones. This is useful during 
the auctions because it is annoying to buy a 
forgery. Another way is to hire a middleman to 
attend anonymous to the auctions. This way the 
other players don't know he tries to buy a certain 
painting and it gets cheaper. Of course the 
middleman can't profit from the player's expertise 
and is more likely to buy a forgery. In Chicago 
the player can hire robbers to steal paintings 
from his competitors.

been raised by foxes, and intends to follow 
through on a promise she made to her elders to 
wipe them out and restore the planet to humanity. 
 
Each level must be completed within a time limit, 
but progressing from left to right. She is armed 
with a whip, a useful weapon for attacking the 
denizens of dinosaurs on each level. Lots of bonus 
items can also be whipped to activate them - bonus 
lives and extra time for example. Tokens to turn 
into a fox can also be collected - enough of these 
takes you into a bonus level set underground.

Wacky Darts (c) 1992 Big Red Software / 
Codemasters 
 
The bar-room game of darts involves aiming small 
projectiles at a circular board. The board is 
divided into 20 shapes around the edge, each of 
which has a value from 1 to 20 points, a special 
'double' area around the edge, and a special 
'treble' area in the middle (each of which 
multiply the shot score). There is also a Bullseye 
right in the middle for 50 points, and an Outer 
Bull around it, worth 25 points. 
 
Players always take three shots at a time. In the 
501 game the aim is to reduce your score from 501 
to 0, finishing with a double or the bull. If your 
score reaches 1 or a negative number, any shots in 
that set of 3 are cancelled out. In Round The 
Board you must hit each target in turn starting 
with 20, but moving back 2 or 3 for a double or 
treble, eventually finishing with Double Top. 
 
Both of these games are recreated in this 
simulation. The movement of the cursor you use to 
aim is slightly skiddy, to recreate natural 
jitters (or, as some would cynically suggest, the 
effects of being as drunk as most darts players). 
 
Wacky Darts lives up to its name by featuring an 
assortment of human, alien and machine opponents 
of varying difficulties. Each of them has a short 
profile, and use a different object to hit the 
board.

Wacky Races (c) 1992 PAL Developments / Hi-Tec 
Software Ltd. 
 
You take on the role of Dastardly and Mutley from 
the Hanna-Barbera cartoon series in this action 
title with superficial racing overtones. Your aim 
is to complete each course in a particular 
position, which is achieved either by waiting for 
them to suffer enough damage to drop out of the 
race, or by inflicting that damage yourself. Your 
car is armed with a forward-shooting arrow to 
impale the opposition cars, and deal with the many 
hazards the races throw at you, including boulders 
and rabbits, which can be taken out for points. 
 
The action is viewed from the side, scrolling 
horizontally as you progress, and vertically when 
you need to jump or duck over the bigger hazards, 
which must be avoided Moon Patrol style, meaning 
that you must often time one jump properly so as 
to be able to make the next one successfully. In 
some sections of the road you can duck down onto 
another set of roads, which may or may not be less 
hazardous. Falling into thin air costs you a life, 
while heavy impacts deduct some of your energy 
points. When the view doesn’t show the next 
section, and the correct course is not clear, an 
arrow appears to direct you.

War (c) 1986 Software Communications Ltd. / 
Martech 
 
The planet Earth is on the verge of being invaded 
by a group of aliens whose objective is the 
conquest of other planets. They are approaching 
Earth in a fleet of twenty cylinders containing 
cities, fields, factories, power stations, 
military bases, and shoe shops. As the aliens 
launch their attack on Earth, a pilot, controlled 
by the player, has been sent to destroy each 
cylinder one by one within a certain amount of 
time. 
 
Once the pilot has done enough damage to the 
cylinder, the pilot then proceeds to the escape 
portal. This escape portal has a security system 
which consists of five rows of colored squares 
that scrolls from right to left. For a successful 
hack, the player must line up two arrows that 
point to a square, and fire at the square whose 
color matches the border of the screen. If the 
player fails the hack, then they have to destroy 
the cylinder again. If successful, the player 
proceeds to the next cylinder where their 
task becomes more difficult.

Only you can save the world from destruction, by 
finding four parts of the weapon to use against 
the Alien Syndicate's evil leader. This task must 
be completed within 80 minutes, although you have 
five lives available. 
 
Gameplay mainly involves propelling your 
jumpsuit-backed and powerfully-armed character 
through the levels, destroying the alien forces as 
he goes. The levels have lots of pieces of ledges 
and spikes all around, which must be planned 
around, as well as lava pits. There is extra 
weaponry and ammunition to collect along the way. 
Your main weapon can be fired in any direction, 
but you can't move and fire at the same time 
unless you're firing to the left or right.

Way of the Exploding Fist, The (c) 1985 
 
This menacingly-titled beat 'em up was the first 
in many martial arts titles from Australia's 
Melbourne House. Sixteen different moves are on 
offer, ranging from standard kicks to jumps, 
somersaults and roundhouse kicks. 
 
The move executed each time is defined based on 
the character's direction, the joystick/keyboard 
positioning, and on whether the fire button is 
depressed, in a system which became standard on 
single-button control systems. 
 
To win each bout you must score 2 Yin-Yangs - a 
perfectly executed kick/punch scores a full one, 
whereas a less forceful contact offers half a 
point - the best moves also offer more points. In 
the one-player game, you advance through a Dan by 
winning two successive bouts, and a single win for 
the opponent means game over. The champion in a 
two-player duel is decided by points after 4 
rounds.

Western Games has six Wild West themed sport-style 
events. In Arm Wrestling you must pull the 
joystick back when the arm in the central display 
has entered a strong phase and press the button to 
prop the arm up then hope for the best. 
 
The Beershooting event requires you to shoot a 5 
beer glass targets faster than your opponent, but 
this is not too easy if you get nervous.Player 1 
moves the joystick to the right to draw their gun, 
while Player 2 must move theirs to the left. Once 
the gun is drawn, the crosshairs are used to line 
up the target. Press the joystick button to fire. 
A beating heart shows the degree of your 
nervousness in the display. 
 
Quid-spitting requires that you bite off the right 
amount of tobacco and chew it to just the right 
consistency before you determine what angle to 
spit it into the pot. This requires some fancy 
joystick handling. To lift your arm and bite off 
the quid, you must move the joystick forward.To 
chew, you must move the joystick fast to the left 
and right. Don't chew it too long or too short. To 
stop chewing, you must move the joystick forward. 
Once that is done you must pull the stick back to 
determine the strength. Click and hold the 
joystick button to determine the right angle. 
Press the joystick button to spit. Timing is the 
key. 
 
The Milking event has a rhythmically heaving udder 
indicating the beat that you must move the 
joystick. To fill the cans, the joystick must be 
moved in a predetermined pattern, but it must be 
moved rythmically with the udder. You can elbow 
your opponent to get the upper hand by moving your 
joystick to the right and pressing the joystick 
button. 
 
Dancing requires a complicated routine of joystick 
movements to do certain dance moves while keeping 
the beat. Lose the beat and the other guys bash 
the piano player on the head causing him to stop 
playing. You must buy the piano player another 
beer to have him resume playing. 
 
The Eating competition is the final event. Dip the 
spoon into the stew. Balance the spoon. Slurp. 
Chew. Swallow. and drink. Simple? No. If you get 
some out of order, you get delayed by belching. 
Dip the spoon by moving the joystick back. Balance 
the spoon by moving the joystick to the left and 
right.

Wild Streets (c) 1989 Titus Software Corporation / 
Titus Ltd. 
 
New-York, Year 1998. The once most prestigious 
   city in the world, has now become a fighting 
   zone. 
Half of the city is left in ruins, and it is in 
that part of town that the marginals and gangs are 
living, hunted by every law enforcement agencies. 
The other half of the city consists of fancy 
mansions, in some of which the most important drug 
barons reside. 
Unfortunately, they are the ones who run the city 
using the enormous profits they make from dealing 
drugs and weapons. 
They now have succeeded in endangering the 
country's economy. 
 
The U.S. government, wanting to avoid a terrible 
crisis, called the CIA to run several types of 
operations in order to get rid of this bad 
substitute of government. 
The C.I.A., headed up by "The Boss", has to clean 
up the city of its crooks. 
One plan is to reorganize the city by placing 
security check-points at strategic positions. 
The operation was set up for April 4, and quickly 
proved to be an unprecedented success. 
The badly organized, smaller street gangs, were 
greatly outnumbered and couldn't match the 
extremely well armed law enforcement troops. 
 
On May 7, during a successful raid, the state 
police special branch, took possession of a huge 
arsenal of weapons and ammunition, worth more than 
two million dollars. 
This raid was an important stage in the whole 
operation. 
Realizing the sticky situation they were in, the 
heads of the crime organizations now started 
making plans for themselves: They needed to regain 
their control over the city and above all, secure 
their territories. 
On May 15, they kidnapped "The Boss" in order to 
get from him the names of his operatives involved 
in the C.I.A. fight against organized crime. 
This way, they were convinced they could stay in 
control of the situation and become even more 
powerful. 
 
Your mission is to liberate "The Boss" and to 
bring him back safely. 
 
You're gonna be dropped from the chopper with your 
panther at the spot where "The Boss" was last 
seen. 
You have your 357 Magnum ready and the panther is 
trained to protect you closely. 
 
You'll have to travel through the various parts of 
the city, in search of the hostage, and you will 
find that your street fighting skills will prove 
to be very useful. 
 
In each part of the city, you will confront 
various enemies and their gang leaders. 
They will become more and more skilled in combat 
as you progress. Some of them are so powerful that 
it would be wise to save bullets for these 
particular fights. 
Once you reach the point where "The Boss" is held 
prisoner, you must rescue him and safely escort 
him back to a safe place. 
 
On the way back, you will have to be particularly 
careful, since you will have to protect "The Boss" 
whose physical condition has been worn out. 
 
Wild Streets is a side-scrolling arcade game, in 
which you fight enemies using punches, kicks, your 
gun and sometimes your panther will help you.

Wings of Fury (c) 1990 Brøderbund Software, Inc. / 
Loriciel SA 
 
Wings of Fury is an action game with some minor 
simulation aspects, in which you are the pilot of 
an American F6F Hellcat plane. The setting of the 
game is the Pacific during World War II. 
 
It is your job to defeat the Japanese by 
destroying enemy bunkers, machine gun nests and 
barracks on a series of islands. Barracks and gun 
nests can be bombarded with regular bombs, while 
you'll have to use rockets to take out the 
concrete bunkers. After a successful bombing run, 
return to mow down the Japanese soldiers with your 
machine guns. You also have to sink Japanese 
battleships with torpedoes and engage in dogfights 
with enemy fighter planes. 
 
 
You start each mission by taking off from an 
aircraft carrier, which you'll have to protect 
from assaults by Japanese torpedo planes. Whenever 
you run out of fuel, bombs, rockets or machine gun 
ammo you can replenish those by returning to your 
carrier. Your carrier is also the place to repair 
damage to your plane. 
 
The Gameboy Color version of Wings of Fury has a 
toned down violence level. You no longer mow down 
Japanese soldiers with your machine guns, instead 
you bombard jeeps & trucks. Also missing in this 
version are the Japanese torpedo planes and the 
small 1st-person view window. New are some extra 
manoeuvres for your plane like a barrel roll and a 
review of your ammo consumption after each 
mission. Using less ammo than allocated gives you 
bonus points.

Winter Sports (c) 1985 Software Images / Electric 
Dreams Software 
 
Eight winter sports events are recreated in this 
Epyx-style action game. Three variations on skiing 
are included - Downhill, Slalom and Giant Slalom, 
which involve setting the correct speed and 
direction change as you steam through the gates. 
These events have a split-screen view displaying 
different angles at once, as to the Bobsled, Speed 
Skating, Bobsled and Biathlon (all bar the latter 
are vertically-split). As it includes target 
shooting, the Biathlon is one of the more 
challenging events. The game also includes an Ice 
Hockey mode as something of a bonus.

(From the Infocom Home Page site) 
 
In Wishbringer, you're a postal clerk in a small 
seaside village called Festeron. You deliver a 
strange envelope to a magic shop, and discover 
that an old woman's black cat has been kidnapped 
by "the Evil One." The old woman asks for your 
help, and when you leave the magic shop, you find 
yourself trapped in a nightmare world. Your 
once-quit town is now full of goons, trolls, 
vultures, fortress-like towers, and assorted 
wickedness. You become entangled in the struggle 
between Good and Evil

Wizard's Lair (c) 1985 Bubble Bus Software / 
Bubble Bus Software 
 
Building on the basic gameplay and visual ideas of 
Ultimate's Atic Atac, Wizard's Lair stars explorer 
Pothole Pete, who is stuck in the Lair unless he 
can find all four pieces of the Golden Lion. The 
game is viewed slightly top-down, with indoor 
rooms bordered by line drawn vectors rather than 
the fuller jungle graphics. 
 
The pace of the game is quite fast, and the 
challenge of the action elements is increased by 
not having infinite weaponry. The route through 
the game is non-linear, with multiple exits and 
secret rooms commonplace. Although the screens 
always contain a particular area, rather than the 
sections of different areas viewed in Atic Atac 
(which meant that you'd often have to work out how 
to reach some sections via other screens), a river 
is a central aspect of the layout, and delimits 
some sections of the screens.

Wizard Warz is an overhead view action RPG using

apprentice wizard with four minor spells, and aim 
to defeat 7 master wizards to become the chief 
wizard yourself. To aid you in your quest you must 
return six treasures to their rightful owners and 
find more powerful spells. 
 
There are also numerous monsters to fight on your 
travels, each with their own strengths and 
weaknesses to your offensive magical barrage. 
 
You can also use a familiar to help your mission - 
for example, having a crow will let you see the 
furthest distance.

Wizball (c) 1987 Sensible Software / Ocean 
Software Ltd. 
 
In Wizball the player takes the role of the 
friendly wizard Wiz who can turn himself into a 
green ball that is able to defend his world 
against the color-sucking enemies who have turned 
his once brightly colored Wizworld into a drab 
planet. With his trusty feline companion Catelite, 
the wizard will restore the colors to the world by 
retrieving them from defeated enemies. 
 
The player starts out as a bouncing green ball 
that can shoot and be put into more or less heavy 
rotation to move slowly or faster, physically 
correct through the side-scrolling levels. The 
first task is to upgrade the ball by shooting the 
first non-moving enemies, and collect the green 
bubbles that are left by them. In order to stand a 
chance against the following moving enemy waves, 
some upgrades are a must. First and foremost, 
complete control over the ball should be activated 
(i.e. flying through the levels), a shield 
sheltering the top and bottom of the player's 
should be acquired, and two-way fire (left/right) 
should be obtained. 
 
But the extra needed to advance in Wizball is your 
friend Catelite who will, once summoned, take the 
form of a small green satellite that will imitate 
the ball's movement, or can be directly controlled 
by the player. Besides upping Wiz' fire power, 
Catelite is able to collect paint drops left by a 
certain kind of defeated enemies until the 
respective color pot is filled up. There's three 
colors available (red, green and blue), and 
several different combinations of them must be 
collected to complete a level and restore it to 
former colorfulness. Every color combination 
collected will send Wiz to a bonus stage, then to 
his laboratory where one of the power-ups can be 
made permanently. 
 
The game also features a bunch of multi-player 
modes, there's even a two-player cooperative mode 
amongst them.

Wonderboy (c) 1987 Westone Co., Ltd. / Activision, 
Inc. 
 
Just when things were going great with Tom-Tom and 
his girlfriend Tanya, some thug of a woodland king 
had to kidnap her and hide her away, and Tom-Tom 
doesn't have a clue where. That's why he has to 
explore deep dark forests, cross endless oceans, 
climb treacherous slopes, survive endless 
volcanoes, and even walk through clouds. But 
Tom-Tom will never be totally alone. You see, when 
he goes through the exotic locations, he has to 
come face to face with its inhabitants, like bees, 
spiders, snakes, coal-kids, frogs, bats, snails, 
coyotes, and octopuses, to name a few. The hatchet 
is Tom-Tom's only line of defense against these 
menaces. 
 
There are ten areas, each containing four rounds 
each, but the tenth area can't be accessed unless 
Tom-Tom collects all the dolls during his rescue 
mission. During his journey, he can break open 
different eggs that will reveal hatchets, 
skateboards, mushrooms, milk, and even guardian 
angels. You can ride the skateboard through each 
round, as long as you don't collide with an 
inhabitant. When you complete each round while 
still riding the skateboard, you'll start the next 
round still riding it. As you progress through 
each round, your vitality will start to get low, 
but it can be increased by getting milk, 
mushrooms, potato chips,or fruit that appear 
everywhere you go. As well as the normal eggs, 
there are also speckled eggs that must be avoided, 
otherwise the God of Death will be released, and 
once he follows you, you'll lose vitality much 
quickly. At the end of every fourth round, there 
is a king waiting to destroy you with his 
fireballs or lightning bolts. 
 
There are also warp-gates, but you don't find 
them, they find you. You see, warp-gates appear in 
rounds 1-4 of each area. If you happen to get one 
fruit, a special item will appear. These special 
items include handbags, wrist watches, a pair of 
shoes, a teddy bear, and a bottle of perfume. 
Another girl will appear and take you up to the 
clouds where the object is to collect as many 
hearts as you can without falling down or getting 
the item again. Once you have collected all the 
hearts, you can get the item to return to the 
surface, and more often than not, you'll get 
further in the round.

World Championship Boxing Manager (c) 1990 Goliath 
Games / Goliath Games 
 
Manage a stable of 3 wannabe heavyweight world 
champions in this unusual twist of the standard 
football management style. The option are selected 
through an icon-based system, representing your 
office. 
 
Training your fighters involves deciding which 
areas they should work on, considering their 
strengths and weaknesses and any damage inflicted 
in previous fights, and those of their next 
opponent. 
 
There are 97 of these in the game, so reaching the 
top of the rankings will take 15-20 fights, just 
like real life. Choosing a beatable opponent, but 
one who can get your fight as high up the Friday 
Night bill as possible, negotiating the best 
financial deal, and a mutually agreeable dare, are 
the main considerations. 
 
Two different governing bodies are included in the 
game, each with subtly different rules, and a 
fight in one set of rules won’t be viewed quite as 
significantly by the other. 
 
The matches are presented from the commentary box, 
with the 2 expert analysts exchanging textual 
descriptions of the key punches, and who is dong 
the best (a clue to how any judges’ decision would 
go). Before and during the fights you can instruct 
your man as to what tactics to adopt.

rough which make for more complex courses than the

A course editor is provided.  The courses provided 
include real courses like St. Andrews, a fictional 
designs such as The Gauntlet, which as the name 
suggests is designed to push your skills to the 
maximum. 
 
The PC version revolutionized the use of the PC 
speaker to reproduce voice samples via their 
patented "RealSound" process. Quips like "No doubt 
about it, he's deep in the sandtrap", "Straight 
onto the fairway", and "Looks like he hit the 
tree, Jim." are used to provide running commentary 
on the gameplay.

The game itself is top-down and features the full 
World Cup structure and all the 24 teams who were 
involved. Multiple formations and team selections 
are available before each match. The ball sticks 
to the feet of the players, who can be tackled 
either by doing a block tackle, or attempting a 
slide tackle, which risks giving away a foul. 
Matches can vary between 4 and 90 minutes, and 
each player has differing skills and behaviour 
style depending on his team's relative ability.

Worm in Paradise, The (c) 1986 Level 9 Computing, 
Ltd. / Level 9 Computing, Ltd. 
 
Eden has been successfully colonised, by creating 
several domed cities. Society is rigidly 
functioning, unemployment, crime and poverty all 
non-existent. The economy functions on fines 
rather than taxes, making for a plethora of petty 
rules and no penal punishment. Robot employees 
make everything run cheaply. Body part reselling 
allows hospitals to turn a profit. Robots can even 
control human reproduction. The end result is a 
society in which humans have no useful role. Who 
would live in a 'paradise' like this? 
 
The Worm In Paradise is the culmination of the 
Silicon Dreams series of interactive fiction. The 
game relies on strict timing and a day/night cycle 
(using a decimal clock with 10 100-minute hours) – 
return to your home before darkness falls, and 
don't expect robots to help with tasks which will 
not be finished in the day. Vital buildings can be 
located using colour-coded co-ordinates, but these 
change every time you load the game, so be careful 
to write them down.

Wriggler (c) 1985 Devonshire House / Romantic 
Robot 
 
One of the few games to set you as a maggot, in 
Wriggler you must negotiate the four stages of the 
Maggot Marathon. This involves trekking through a 
garden, a shrubbery, an underground lair, and 
finally a mansion. 
 
Viewed form above the game is maze-based, with 
lots of Atic Atac style sections where you can see 
other parts of the level on the same screen, but 
can't access them because the design of the maze 
puts something in the way. Graphics are quite 
large and chunky - this is perhaps the closest 
anyone came to borrowing Rapscallion's unusual 
visual design. 
 
You have an energy bar which decreases constantly, 
and contact with the ants, spiders and the rest of 
the sickly creatures reduces this further. 
Fortunately you can obtain apples, cherries, cups 
of tea (I suspect a generation of sadistic 
10-year-olds started trying to ply worms with 
caffeine as a result of this) and other foodstuffs 
to recharge this. These can be eaten immediately 
or stored for later use, however you can only hold 
one object at a time. Many other items are needed 
to get past situations during the game, so be 
careful what you keep to avoid too much 
backtracking through the 256 screens.

WWF Wrestlemania (c) 1991 Twilight / Ocean 
Software Ltd. 
 
At the height of the World Wrestling Federation's 
European fame came this crunching recreation of 
the elaborate hammed-up action. Hulk Hogan, The 
Ultimate Warrior or the British Bulldog can come 
under your control. 
 
You play either in practice matches (against the 
hopefully-misnamed Mr Perfect) or in a sequence of 
5 matches to win the Wrestlemania Belt. Your 
opponents have different special moves - watch out 
for The Warlord's Full Nelson and Sgt. Slaughter's 
Camel Clutch, for example. Before the fights 
start, your opponents will deliver a taunt, which 
you must respond to as creatively as possible. 
 
The game is a beat 'em up viewed from a forced 
perspective above and behind the action. Your aim 
is to pin your opponent to the ground for 3 
seconds, which can only be done once he has been 
weakened. Kicks, punches and throws will reduce an 
opponent's strength bar. When a strong opponent is 
down, stamping on him will pay off more than 
attempting a pin. 
 
Avoid leaving the ring for too long - 20 seconds 
out and the match is void, which counts as a 
defeat. As in real WWF, the frame of the arena can 
be used to perform moves. Once players are in 
close contact, waggle the joystick to ensure you 
win the grapple.

Xeno (c) 1986 Binary Design, Ltd. / A&F&nbsp 
 
Xeno is a future sport resembling Air Hockey. Each 
of the two players (the second being either human 
or computer controlled) controls a ground skimmer, 
which is aiming to hit a puck so as to knock it 
into their opponent's goal. This is done in a 
turn-based manner, in which each player controls a 
movement line which sets up their intended move 
before it is enacted. 
 
The arena is surrounded by walls, so rebounds (of 
both the puck and the skimmers) have to be 
factored into your shot selection. You are not 
required to hit the puck with a shot, so some 
shots can be defensive-minded. You can toggle 
between 1 and 9 seconds for the shot time, and 
between 1 and 9 minutes for the length of each of 
the four quarters.

Xenon (c) 1988 Bitmap Brothers, The / Melbourne 
House 
 
Xenon is the obscure and mysterious predecessor to 
the much better known Xenon 2: Megablast. The game 
is actually nothing like its sequel, with 
completely different control scheme and gameplay. 
The plot overlaps however, with the Xenites making 
their first attempt to control the galaxy. 
 
Xenon is essentially an overhead shooter, where 
the player controls the ship and moves around the 
screen. However, the difference between Xenon and 
its sequel is that here the player actually 
controls the movement of the playfield (up or 
down) by simply moving the ship in the direction 
of choice. To do this in the sequel, players need 
to slam your ship against the bottom of the screen 
and pull back on the stick in order to 
reverse-scroll the playfield. 
 
It also features a 3D playfield (some enemies, for 
example, will be mounted on hills of sort, where 
players can't shoot them). To combat these the 
player can transform its tank into a plane. The 
game then switches to the more familiar gameplay 
style as seen in other vertically scrolling 
shooters. The plane has to transform back into a 
tank again to combat most ground units. 
 
In Xenon, upgrades are taken from destroyed 
enemies.

Xenophobe (c) 1989 Bally Midway Manufacturing Co., 
Inc. / MicroStyle 
 
Xenos.  The very name strikes fear into every 
colonist's heart.  A distress call is received 
from space stations orbiting your homeworld, then 
silence.  A single ship escapes, piloted by a 
battered man who tells the tale of pods that hatch 
into acid-spitting Xenos. 
 
A small band of engineers has been dispatched to 
combat the Xeno threat before it takes over all 
the space stations and, eventually, your 
homeworld.  Assemble your band of engineers and 
fight the Xenos on each station, striving to 
either clear it or abandon it.  You start out with 
a standard issue laser, but can pick up additiona 
weapons as you find them, including Phasers, 
Lightning Rifles, Poofer guns, and bombs. 
 
Xenophobe was originally an arcade coin-op by 
Bally/Midway, released in 1987.  Gameplay premise 
and setting is heavily inspired/influenced by the 
movie Aliens.

In principle, this is yet another (technically 
very impressive) horizontally scrolling 
shoot-'em-up. The interesting twist about the 
scenario is that it doesn't play in space like the 
similar game R-Type and most of its clones - 
instead, the fight between good and evil is 
underwater. 
 
Through five levels, you have to shoot countless 
enemies, complete with the obligatory mid-level 
and end-level bosses. The most innovative part of 
this game comes after a level when you get to 
purchase new weapons - instead of simply buying 
upgrades, you can customize your ship by placing 
your new weapons anywhere on it.

Xybots is either an unusually simple computer game 
or an unusually complex coin-op shoot 'em up, 
depending on your point of view. With either one 
or two players, you must move through a series of 
Gauntlet-style underground mazes, killing the bad 
guys and collecting health and other bonuses from 
flying saucers (underground? SLIGHT logic gap 
there, methinks).It's designed to be played 
co-operatively, although bullets from one player 
can harm the other. 
 
The Xybots are out to stop you, of course, and 
many have advanced attack patterns as well as 
bullets to fire at you. Being able to view round 
corners is useful, allowing you to plan a strategy 
- often it's good to send one player forward and 
let the other play the waiting game, as in 
Gauntlet.

Xyphoes Fantasy (c) 1991 
 
The evil Kan is spreading his power over the land 
of Norem, using his minions called Skull. As a 
brave warrior, you are asked by an old magician to 
help him rid the land of Kan and the Skull. 
 
The basic gameplay of Xyphoes is similar to that 
of Shadow of the Beast or parts of Psychic World, 
where you walk along a monster-infested landscape 
and the main task is to get as far to the right as 
you can without losing your life. Apart from 
walking, ducking and jumping, your warrior can 
send energy waves at monsters. Potions and magic 
crystals upgrade your weapon or give you a 
protective shield. For each level, the magician 
demands that you find a number of magic items 
which will restore his power. After having cleared 
the platform levels, you must face one of Kan's 
swordsmen and defeat him, Barbarian-style. In 
level two, you are given a horse to ride through 
the landscape, similar to Shinobi III. 
 
Technically, Xyphoes Fantasy is an advanced game, 
made by people from the French demo scene. Running 
only on a 128K CPC, it features digitised music on 
the title screen, an in-game soundtrack, lots of 
colours and overscan.

In Yabba Dabba Doo the player has to help Fred win 
Wilma's heart. To do this he must build a house by 
collecting rocks and putting them in the right 
place. There are obstacles to this, small rocks 
get in the way, turtles bite your ankles and 
pterodactyls drop rocks on you too. Also while 
you're away neighbours will pinch bits. 
Once the house is built, you have to get Fred a 
car so that he can get to the quarry to work, thus 
earning enough money to hire a dino crane to put 
the roof on. Progress is measured by points, these 
are gained as you build the house, get to work and 
finally find Wilma.

Yes Prime Minister (c) 1987 Oxford Digital 
Enterprises Ltd. / Mosaic Publishing 
 
A week in the life of the British Prime Minister.  
But not just any Prime Minister, this game puts 
you in the shoes of Prime Minister James (Jim) 
Hacker from the classic BBC television comedy 
"Yes, Prime Minister". 
 
Much like most political simulations, you must 
balance your popularity with the needs of your 
party, the meddling of foreign governments, and 
the small minded incompetence of the civil 
servants that surround you.  All of this is played 
out with multiple choice dialogues between Hacker 
and the other cast members of the series (complete 
with lo-res digital pictures).  The dry humor of 
the show abounds as you must deal with crises such 
as the French refusing to continue work on the 
channel tunnel until Waterloo station is renamed.  
Fans of the show will recognize much of the 
material and non-fans should still find enough 
laughs to keep them interested.

Zap't'Balls is most notable for its technical 
novelties. Amstrad experts would think it was 
running on a Plus, as what appear to be hardware 
sprites are moving smoothly at full speed. 
However, this was accomplished on a stock CPC by 
forming a stack within video RAM itself, a 
technique achieved by disabling interrupts. 
 
The game itself is similar to Pang. One or two 
players have 80 screens of balls to clear, by 
firing a rope vertically such that a ball will hit 
it. Upon doing this it splits into two balls of 
half the size, unless it is at the smallest size, 
when it will disappear. Each screen must be 
cleared within a time limit. Contact with a ball 
costs the player a life.

Try to find a weapon with which to attack the

zombies should be placed in the freezer in the

shops to rest and the food shops for nourishment.

In the third game of the famous adventure game

through a beautiful magical land, but are 
immediately cast into a deep dungeon. Like in a

conscience returns to you, you find yourself on 
the endless spiral of stairs, with only your 
trusty lantern near you... will you be able to 
survive the horrors of the Dungeon? 
 
Like its predecessors, "Zork III: The Dungeon 
Master" is a text adventure game. You read 
descriptions of rooms and then interact with the 
game by typing commands. As all early Zork games, 
it is very easy to get stuck in the game, so 
you'll have to reload several times in order to 
find the correct way.

Zork: The Great Underground Empire is a classic 
text adventure game.  The player begins as an 
"adventurer" standing near a white house in a nice 
forest, but soon descends into the Great 
Underground Empire, where most of the game takes 
place. The player's quest is to collect the 
Nineteen Treasures of Zork. 
 
As was typical for adventure games of its era, 
Zork does not use graphics. Instead, it 
communicates with the player via text, and the 
player interacts with the game by typing commands, 
such as "examine mailbox" or "take torch". For 
movement, the player types in geographical 
directions (such as "north" or "east" - or just 
"n" and "e"), and can check what items are being 
carried with the "inventory" command (or just 
"i"). 
 
Zork was ported over from mainframes in the late 
1970s. It is one of the first "text adventures" 
and is widely considered to be one of the great 
classics of the genre which reached the peak of 
its popularity in the '80s.

All the ingredients from the Zorro story feature 
in this action game - a kidnapped senorita, an

henchmen and of course the obligatory swordfight! 
 
This computer version of Zorro is a strange beast, 
he can leap across buildings, fall 50 feet and 
land like a feather, with neither a scratch to his 
head or a crease in his cape. He can also perform 
masterful tricks, such as balancing a large plant 
pot on his head, while simultaneously climbing up 
a ladder. 
 
Zorro has similar platform gameplay to the same 
company's Bruce Lee game, but with a slower pace 
and more puzzle elements. There are 20 different 
screens in the game, with The Ole Hotel screen 
being used continually throughout the game. The 
player must overcome various puzzles, including 
the branding of a bull and catapulting into the 
air via a conveniently left spring board and a 
dazed Garcia guard!

Zub (c) 1987 Binary Design, Ltd. / Mastertronic 
Ltd. 
 
Zub is a cartoon platform game, the first title 
developed by the brothers Ste Pickford and John 
Pickford as a team. In a humorous twist, every 
creature in the game is named Zub, including the 
main character. The player controls Zub, an alien 
warrior that received a mission from his Emperor 
Zub of the Zub galactic empire: to retrieve the 
Green Eye of Zub, a powerful artifact. 
 
Zub must ride the intergalactic elevators to reach 
other planets and continue the search for the Eye. 
The worlds are very empty, featuring a few 
platforms and sparsely populated by dangerous 
monsters called Zubs. Zub must hop to the existing 
platforms, position them next to each other, and 
keep jumping and alternating between them to 
ascend to the top of the level and move to the 
next planet. The Zubs float around the scene 
following the hero, trying to touch and drain some 
of the health energy, and have to be killed with 
the laser gun.

offered for shooting some, which can be used to 
obtain better weapons including ground-attack 
lasers, speed ups and multiple bullets. Extra

Cid, El (c) 1987 Dro Soft / Mastertronic Group 
Ltd. 
 
This is a fictitious adventure protagonized by "el 
Cid Campeador", a Castilian hero who contributed 
magnificently to the Spanish "Reconquista" (the 
re-conquest of the Hispanic territories which were 
invaded by Moors, time period which starts on 722 
and ends on 1492 with the taking of the last 
Hispanic territory, Granada). 
 
But talking about the game, we are on the XI 
century, a dark time full of incessant fights 
between the the good and the evil. A legend whose 
antiquity was lost in the abyss of the times, 
assured the existence a parchment that, with being 
read by the evil forces, would trigger such big 
wave of disasters that Satan would be able to 
seize the Earth and assure its dominion as prince 
of the darkness. 
 
Our audacious protagonist, when knowing the legend 
of the parchment, was decided to recover it for 
the forces of the good, since the legend also 
affirmed that if this document would be read by 
two persons of good intentions, their effects 
would be annulled for ever. 
 
With this objective in mind, he began to search 
the magical key, that released the spell that had 
hidden the parchment. But the task was not going 
to be simple, like him, many horsemen had decided 
to find the parchment, some with glory anxieties 
and others by less worthy reasons. Luckily for 
Rodrigo (el Cid), the many years of fight against 
the Moors had fortified their noble arm, reason 
why the combats by sword are no secret for him.

After 20 years in space, the Orion has finally 
accomplished its task of galaxy mapping. Only one 
small nebula remains, but while making the 
intergalactic jump, the Orion is taken over by an 
alien race known as the Zimen. 
 
In an attempt to get rid of the Zimen, the players 
control four robots - Captain Slog, Plot the 
Navigator, Engineer Knut, and Able Spaceman Bodd - 
which they use one at a time. Each robot is 
situated in different areas of the ship. Some 
robots can easily navigate their way through the 
maze of 230 rooms, while others are temporarily 
trapped in their rooms. 
 
When a robot comes into contact with the Zimen, 
its energy is quickly drained. When all of its 
energy is depleted, the robot will stop 
functioning, and the only way it can be restored 
is if a passing robot transfers its energy with 
the non-functional one. 
 
The Zimen materializes suddenly in the Orion's 
passageways with deadly persistance, and can 
easily trap the outnumbered crew into a corner. To 
help them, the robots can throw bouncing bombs at 
the Zimen, gaining points when they have been 
destroyed. 
 
Control panels scattered throughout the ship give 
a robot access to code screens. When decoded, 
these will unlock matter-transmitters and lifts, 
meaning that the robot crew can move through the 
ship and closer to the ultimate goal: locking into 
the Bridge Computer. When all four have done this, 
the Orion will be safe.

Madmix 2 (c) 1990 Topo Soft / Topo Soft 
 
Peace had arrived finally at "Cocovillage" thanks 
to the good work made by Mad Mix, who had become 
the worthy successor of his grandfather. But the 
nightmare had still not finished, because a few 
miles away, in the town of his cousin Ope, 
"Cococastle" (a place crowned by a phantasmagoric 
Castle), it was happening a strange phenomena. All 
the indications made think that a "coco", survivor 
of "Cocovillage", had converted the Castle into 
his dwelling, establishing in addition a 
maleficent alliance with the sinister inhabitants 
from that place. The terror had seized the 
inhabitants of "Cococastle", and only Mad can give 
back the tranquillity to the pacific inhabitants 
of this village. 
 
The game consists in eating all the "coconuts" 
(small ball species that are dispersed through all 
the Castle) which appear at every moment. Once you 
have finished with all the coconuts of the level 
you will pass to the following stay of the Castle 
of the Ghosts, this is the mechanic until you have 
been able to explore all its corners. However, you 
shouldn't care only in eating all the "coconuts", 
but in addition you will have to be very kind 
trying to not collide with any of the inhabitants 
of the terrific Castle, as well as to avoid the 
different traps (or using them in your own 
benefit) while taking helpful -some with really 
curious effects- objects.

sprites are moving smoothly at full speed. 
However, this was accomplished on a stock CPC by 
forming a stack within video RAM itself, a 
technique achieved by disabling interrupts. 
 
The game itself is similar to Pang. One or two 
players have 80 screens of balls to clear, by 
firing a rope vertically such that a ball will hit 
it. Upon doing this it splits into two balls of 
half the size, unless it is at the smallest size, 
when it will disappear. Each screen must be 
cleared within a time limit. Contact with a ball 
costs the player a life.

Alienstorm (c) 1991 SEGA Enterprises Ltd. / U.S. 
Gold Ltd. 
 
The aliens are invading Earth, and it's up to the 
"Alien Busters" to wipe them out and destroy their 
creator. The Busters consist of Karla, Gordon, and 
Scooter. Each one of them have their own weapons 
and special attacks. 
 
When you start the game, you can select any one of 
these characters to play as. There are six 
missions to complete (eight in the Genesis 
version) with several stages, and each mission has 
you blasting aliens all the way to the end, from 
the streets to the mother ship where you'll meet 
the mother of all aliens. Unfortunately, blasting 
these aliens will not be an easy task, as they get 
tougher in every mission, and are capable of 
hiding into objects such as plants, postboxes, 
trashcans, drums, and several others. Each mission 
has an objective such as rescuing people 
destroying an UFO. 
 
When you deal with a few aliens, flying heads will 
appear, which you can shoot to collect life or 
energy (by the way, life is important to you, 
since if yours get empty, you're dead). However, 
rather than using your ordinary weapons, you can 
use the special attacks that are enough to kill 
aliens you currently see. These types of attack 
vary depending on the character you choose at the 
start of the game. For instance, Gordon summons a 
U.S. Air Force Jet that drop bombs across the 
street, while Scooter is able to teleport out of 
his present location, and leave a series of bombs 
that will blow up aliens on sight, he will then 
re-appear. However, using your character's special 
attack uses up a lot of energy, and if you have 
little or no energy, you can't use it. 
 
At the end of some missions is an alien boss, 
which you must destroy in order to complete the 
mission. Also, at the end of every one, you have 
to enter buildings where you participate in a 
shooting gallery. The object is to kill aliens 
popping up from several locations with the 
building. 
 
You can play Alien Storm by yourself, or with 
another person.
