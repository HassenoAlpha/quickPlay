Batman and Robin (1997) (71-709) (c) 1997 Tiger 
Electronics, Inc. 
 
Based on the 1997 film starring George Clooney and 
Arnold Schwarzenegger, Batman & Robin for game.com 
has you trying to put Mr. Freeze's crime spree on 
ice as either member of the Dynamic Duo. The 
majority of the action takes place from a 
side-scrolling perspective, where heroes punch, 
kick, and throw projectiles at various goons 
crowding Gotham City's streets. In addition to 
battling such boss characters as Poison Ivy and 
Bane, you must also fling batarangs at thugs in 
special sequences played from a first-person 
perspective. Stop Mr. Freeze and retrieve Gotham 
City's missing diamonds to win the game.

Centipede (1999) (71-755) (c) 1999 Handheld Games 
/ Tiger Electronics, Inc. 
 
In Centipede, you control a ship that shoots 
vertically and moves in all directions along the 
bottom 1/4th of the playfield. You must fire at a 
multi-segmented centipede that starts at the top 
of the screen and crawls its way through a garden 
of mushrooms. Each time the centipede or a segment 
of the centipede hits a mushroom, it will turn the 
other way and continue its descent. If any portion 
of the centipede reaches the bottom of the screen, 
it reverses direction and begins crawling upward. 
This is unlike Space Invaders, in which you lose a 
life when an invader reaches the bottom of the 
playfield.When you shoot a segment of the 
centipede, it turns into a mushroom. After you 
have destroyed the entire centipede, another will 
take its place. In addition to centipedes, you 
must contend with horizontally moving scorpions, 
falling fleas and bouncing spiders. The closer you 
are to a spider when you shoot it, the more points 
you will get. Fleas leave behind a trail of 
mushrooms while scorpions poison existing 
mushrooms. You lose a life any time a creature 
collides with your ship.In this game.com version 
of Centipede, you can choose between the classic 
Arcade style or an updated version. The updated 
mode of play contains higher resolution graphics 
with more detail and, according to the instruction 
manual, is slightly more difficult. You can also 
set the speed at which your ship moves, choose the 
level at which to start, and select from three 
difficulty levels (easy, medium and hard). If you 
feel more comfortable with the directional pad on 
the right side of your game.com unit instead of 
the traditional left position, you can flip the 
screen. 
 
Review by Brett Alan Weiss 
 
Like most people, when I crack open a fresh 
videogame, I always play it for awhile before I 
read the instruction manual or check out the 
options, especially when it's an easy-to-learn 
title like Centipede for game.com. When I first 
began playing this handheld rendition of the 
Arcade classic, I was very disappointed as the 
ship moved much too slowly. Luckily, after a few 
minutes of frustration, I consulted the manual and 
options and was pleasantly surprised to discover 
that the default setting is for slow and that you 
can crank up the speed of the ship to medium or 
fast. Thus, the fun began and I spent a good chunk 
of the afternoon blowing away and avoiding 
centipedes, spiders and other creepy 
creatures.During the early 1980s, Centipede was 
one of my favorite Arcade games, and I'm pleased 
to report that it holds up nicely after two 
decades and numerous home versions. This is a 
competent port of a more than competent game. It 
features the same type of addictive and intense 
gameplay as the original (sans the track ball, of 
course) and keeps the distinctive audio intact, 
right down to the high-pitched, but daunting sound 
effects when the spider pays a visit. Obviously, 
the centipedes are the stars of the show in every 
version, but the pouncing spiders deserve some 
credit for the game's longevity -- the fact that 
you can score more points for shooting them while 
they are close to you is an inspired bit of 
programming. The varying mushroom fields, which 
determine the paths of the centipedes, are also a 
brilliant creation.In addition to a faithfully 
adapted classic Centipede, game.com owners also 
get an updated edition, which features detailed 
centipedes and textured mushrooms. The centipedes 
are viewed from the side and are given eyes and 
antennae. This modern take on an old favorite is 
nice, and I appreciate the enhanced visuals, but 
it plays basically the same as the original game. 
I would have preferred Millipede, which was the 
sequel to Centipede, to have been included in the 
package. After all, Williams Arcade Classics for 
the same system is composed of a whopping five 
different games. 
 
Graphics (4) 
The animation is jerky and there's not a lot of 
depth here, but the game does a decent job of 
keeping the basic look of the original Arcade 
classic intact. Also, the updated version looks 
nice without sacrificing gameplay. 
 
Sound (5) 
The popping sounds of the mushrooms assuming full 
form between rounds remain intact. This is but one 
example of how this game sounds faithful to the 
original. One disappointment I have in this area 
is the tepid rendition of the little victory song 
after you win an extra life. Also, the sound 
effects aren't as strong as those found in 
Williams Arcade Classics. 
 
Enjoyment (7) 
Although I've played Centipede on numerous systems 
throughout the years (one would assume to the 
point of burnout), I found this version to be fun 
and exciting. 
 
Replay Value (6) 
Keep chasing after those high scores and you'll 
play the game until your thumbs are sore. 
 
Documentation (3) 
The manual is a cheaply made fold out, but it 
tells you what you need to know.

Duke Nukem 3D (1997) (71-712) (c) 1997 Tiger 
Electronics, Inc. / GT Interactive Software 
 
Duke Nukem is a foul-mouthed, muscle-bound gun nut 
with a craving for mayhem and anything in a skirt. 
His trash talking, weapon-enhanced bravado comes 
in handy in when aliens attack Earth. These 
invaders from outer space are hell-bent on 
enslaving the world and performing cruel 
biogenetic experiments on unwilling human females. 
In the immortal words of Duke himself, "No one 
takes our chicks and lives..."Your mission in Duke 
Nukem 3D is to frag (kill) as many aliens as you 
can as you work your way through the various rooms 
and areas in three episodes of play: L.A. 
Meltdown, Lunar Apocalypse and Shrapnel City. You 
can select which level you would like to enter 
first. There are four types of aliens for your 
killing pleasure, including Assault Troops, Pig 
Cops, Enforcers and Octobrains.You begin the game 
with your standard weapon, a pistol, which lets 
you fire six rounds in succession before you have 
to reload. Be careful when reloading as it leaves 
you temporarily vulnerable. Whenever you find a 
clip, it will add six rounds to your stash. You 
can carry up to 200 bullets.For more power and a 
wider burst, you can find a shotgun, which you 
must pump to reload every time after firing. 
Pumping leaves you vulnerable for about a second. 
To increase your ammo supply, you can pick up 
boxes containing six shells. The most shells you 
can tote around are 50.The Rocket Propelled 
Launcher (RPG) is the most explosive of the 
weapons you can find. It kills all onscreen 
enemies with a single shot. Cases of RPG 
ammunition contain five rounds. You can only carry 
50 rounds at a time. If you run completely out of 
ammo for all weapons, your boot is your only means 
of attack. This is a weak weapon to say the 
least.As you progress through the game, ridding 
the world of alien scum, you'll need to find key 
cards for use in opening certain doors. You can 
also find med kits to increase your health and 
armor to protect you from enemy firepower. Skill 
levels in Duke Nukem 3D include Piece of Cake, 
Let's Rock, Come Get Some and Damn I'm Good. A 
password feature, which lets you restart a game 
from the level you die on, is also available.

Fighters MegaMix (1998) (71-739) (c) 1998 Tiger 
Electronics, Inc. 
 
Virtua Fighter 2 and Fighting Vipers, a pair of 
arcade hits from Sega, combine to form Fighters 
Megamix for the game.com system. You can play the 
game by yourself or challenge a friend to a few 
rounds. Two-player games require two game.com 
systems, two cartridges and a Head-2-Head 
cable.This hybrid videogame lets you choose from 
eight different fighters: Akira Yuki, Pai, Lion 
and Jacky from Virtua Fighter 2 and Bahn, Candy, 
Sanman and Mahler from Fighting Vipers. By winning 
a certain number of fights (and therefore 
completing courses), you can unlock hidden 
characters from Sega's Daytona USA and Virtua 
Cop.The characters vary in fighting styles and 
abilities. For example, Bahn's strength lies in 
the power of his standing punches while Lion uses 
his uncanny speed to his advantage. While all the 
fighters can walk and run left and right, punch, 
kick, dodge, block, duck and jump, you must 
experiment with the controls to discover their 
individual special moves. Fights in this game 
consist of a series of best two-out-of-three 
matches. Every time your character gets hit, his 
or her health meter will diminish. A few of the 
fighters wear armor, which, until it breaks, 
reduces some of the damage taken from hits. 
Blocking also cuts down on the degree of damage 
taken. The fights are timed, so you should finish 
each course as quickly as possible.Options in the 
1P Mode of Fighters Megamix let you choose from 
three skill levels, three round lengths and three 
time limits. The VS Mode adds the option of 
letting you shorten or lengthen the life power 
(health meter) of each fighter.A special Survival 
Mode lets you fight as many opponents as you can 
defeat. Fights in this mode only last one round 
and you are allowed only one life bar. You get to 
decide how long you want fights to last (3, 7 or 
15 minutes).If you've slapped more quarters into 
Virtual Fighter 2 and Fighting Vipers than you 
care to admit, yet you still yearn to crack some 
skulls, slap Fighters Megamix into your game.com 
system and knock yourself out. Or better yet, 
knock out your opponent.

Frogger (1999) (71-756) (c) 1999 Handheld Games / 
Tiger Electronics, Inc. 
 
Frogger challenges players to maneuver a little 
frog from the bottom of the screen to the top, 
while dodging numerous obstacles along the way. 
Now you can enjoy this harrowing experience on the 
go with Frogger for the game.com handheld 
system.The bottom half of the playfield in Frogger 
is a highway that is apparently experiencing rush 
hour traffic. Cars, trucks and other vehicles zoom 
down this road, their drivers obviously not 
concerned whether or not a frog is trying to get 
to the other side. If you make it across the road, 
you will land on a sidewalk that stretches across 
the middle of the screen.Then you must hop across 
a river (comprising most of the top half of the 
playfield) that is teeming with logs, turtles, 
alligators and snakes. You can bum a ride on the 
logs and turtles and on the backs of the 
alligators, but you should be careful of diving 
turtles and the jaws of the alligators. Also, do 
not float all the way to the right or left side of 
the screen. For bonus points, you can rescue a 
white lady frog that appears from time to 
time.Five home bays are positioned along the top 
of the screen. Your objective is to hop your frog 
into one of these bays before the timer runs out. 
If you catch a fly in the bay, you will get bonus 
points. However, you should try your best not to 
hop into a bay that is occupied by an alligator 
head.After you fill all five bays, you will be 
treated to a brief musical tune. The game will 
then continue at a brisker pace with faster 
traffic, fewer logs in the river and an increased 
number of alligators and snakes. The game ends 
when all your frogs are dead.This version of 
Frogger features two modes of play: Classic, which 
emulates the original, and Updated for the '90s, 
which features detailed graphics and slightly 
harder gameplay. Also, for all you left handers 
out there, you can flip the screen. 
 
Review by Brett Alan Weiss 
 
Frogger for game.com includes Classic mode, which 
faithfully reproduces the arcade original, and 
Updated, which has more detailed graphics and 
slightly harder gameplay. To accommodate the small 
screen, there are just three lanes of traffic and 
three lanes of river obstacles (as opposed to five 
each). Also different is that certain later levels 
are all traffic or all river (as opposed to half 
and half). Confoundingly, the game ends after a 
certain number of levels, instead of continuing 
indefinitely at a harder and harder pace. As with 
many game.com titles, the sound effects and music 
in this game are strong, even featuring a rousing 
rendition of "Camptown Races."

Henry (1997) (71-728) (c) 1997 Tiger Electronics, 
Inc. 
 
Meet HENRY, a sound and picture matching game for 
the game.com portable unit. HENRY's playfield is a 
four-by-four grid of 16 squares, each square 
hiding a randomly chosen sound and picture. Your 
job is to match the clue HENRY gives you with its 
corresponding sound and picture. The visual clues 
appear one at a time in a window on the right side 
of the screen. When you or your opponent (the 
computer or a friend) finds a matching pair, the 
square will light.When four squares in a row are 
lit up, horizontally, vertically or diagonally, 
the game will end. Whoever makes the final match 
in the row is the winner. If you aren't up to 
challenging the computer or a human opponent, you 
can select Practice Mode, which lets you take 
every turn. The goal here is to hone your skills 
to the point where you can light four squares in a 
row without a mistake. You can also choose to play 
the game with only visual clues or only sound 
clues.HENRY contains 80 sounds and phrases in its 
memory banks, including "Four score and seven 
years ago," "Happy Birthday," "Good day, mate" and 
"Gong!" Visual images include apples, leaves, 
footballs, pencils, eyeglasses, globes and other 
commonplace items. 
 
Review by Brett Alan Weiss 
 
Played on a four-by-four grid of 16 squares, each 
square hiding a randomly chosen sound and picture, 
HENRY is a matching game that is extremely limited 
in scope. There are 80 sounds and phrases in its 
memory banks, but the only way to win the game is 
to get the fourth match in a diagonal or 
horizontal line. A tournament mode (or other form 
of extended play) and a game in which the player 
with the most matches wins would help. The apples, 
footballs, and other objects are boring in design, 
but a number of whimsical sound effects, such as 
accented voices, a baby crying, and bells ringing, 
give the game a little personality. Although not 
mentioned anywhere on the package or in the 
manual, HENRY is strictly a children's game -- and 
not a very fun one at that.

Indy 500 (1997) (71-525) (c) 1997 Tiger 
Electronics, Inc. / Tiger Electronics, Inc. 
 
Choose from three different cars to drive in INDY 
500 for the game.com. The cars vary in quickness 
of acceleration, road-gripping abilities and top 
speeds. You can choose standard or manual 
transmission, and you can race in either sunshine 
or rain. There are two camera angles from which to 
choose: above and behind the car and above and 
slightly behind the front tires. Prior to an 
actual race, you must drive four laps in a time 
trial to determine your starting position relative 
to the other 33 cars. A pace car will stay just 
ahead of you.When the real INDY 500 begins, you 
must race 10, 15 or 20 laps (depending on the 
chosen difficulty level) within an allotted period 
of time. As you speed down the straightaways and 
hug the corners of sharp turns, you must attempt 
to pass other cars in order to improve your 
position in the race.If you have too many 
accidents with other cars and/or you repeatedly 
crash into walls, your car will become damaged, 
slowing it down tremendously. You must also watch 
for road hazards. When the PIT symbol flashes on 
screen, let off the gas and take a hard right to 
enter the pit stop. While in the pits, you'll lose 
some time, but your car will be restored to tiptop 
condition.If you are successful in a race, the 
computer will ask you if you would like to 
progress to a higher level. 
 
Review by Brett Alan Weiss 
 
The game.com, the little system that (almost) 
could, constantly amazes me with the strength and 
scope of its sound effects. The Arcade-like sounds 
of Williams Arcade Classics and the loud dinosaur 
rampages of The Lost World: Jurassic Park are mind 
blowing. INDY 500 continues this trend of 
ear-boggling sounds with its roaring engines, 
squealing tires, convincing car crashes and the 
clarity with which the starting announcer speaks. 
It's astounding what power comes out of such a 
tiny little speaker.In addition to realistic 
sounds, INDY 500 has realistic gameplay. Jockeying 
for position on the track, trying to nudge your 
way from the middle of the pack to the forefront 
of the race, is a difficult task. Unlike many 
racing games, in which you can weave in and out of 
cars like a teenager trying to impress a prom 
date, each car you come upon in this game incites 
a singular battle of gas pedals, steering wheels 
and brakes.The game.com doesn't always boast the 
smoothest animation, and INDY 500 is no exception. 
When you get too close to the side of the track, 
the car goes from cruising along nicely to 
slamming into a wall in the blink of an eye. 
However, for a handheld game played on a small 
gray screen, INDY 500 does a good job of 
simulating high speeds. The walls and pavement 
pass by jerkily but convincingly, and the clouds 
coming up over the horizon are a very nice 
touch.INDY 500 is a solid racing title, but it 
does have a couple of faults. After extended 
racing, the gameplay gets redundant. Slowing down 
for and then speeding up after left turn after 
left turn after left turn... Well, you get the 
picture

categories ranging from "history" and "animals" to 
"classic sitcoms" and "birthplaces." The 
touch-screen interface has players using the 
stylus to tap on question values, buzz-in, and to

Lights Out (1997) (71-735) (c) 1997 Tiger 
Electronics, Inc. / Tiger Electronics, Inc. 
 
The goal in Lights Out is to turn off all the 
screen's "lights" in as few moves as possible. A 6 
x 6 grid of light and dark tiles (or buttons) 
forms each puzzle. For every tile you press, a 
number of adjacent tiles will turn on or off in 
either an "X" or "+" shape, depending on the game: 
regular, lit only or toggle. "Lit Only" has you 
touching just the lit buttons on the screen, while 
"Toggle" forces you to alternate between lit and 
unlit tiles in order to solve the puzzle. 
"Regular" lets you press any tile you want in any 
order. As with other games on the system, your 
highest score is automatically saved to memory. 
Lights Out includes over 500 precomputed puzzles 
to test your brain (168 for each game mode), 
ranging in difficulty from three to a maximum of 
30 steps. Once you've mastered the precomputed 
puzzles, you can then try your hand at random 
ones, which will offer 60 billion puzzle 
combinations. Lights Out is available as the 
pack-in cartridge for the game.com system. 
 
Review by Brett Alan Weiss 
 
Lights Out is included as the pack-in with the 
game.com, and in many ways it is the game the 
black-and-white handheld system was born to play. 
The graphics are ultra simplistic, and the save 
feature is an absolute necessity. Also, the game 
makes perfect use of the system's touch-screen 
technology as players use the stylus to execute 
moves on the playfield, which consists of a 36-box 
grid. The goal is to turn off all the screen's 
"lights" in as few moves as possible. For every 
tile pressed, a number of adjacent tiles will turn 
on or off in either an "X" or "+" shape, depending 
on the game: regular, lit only, or toggle. There 
are more than 500 pre-computed puzzles to test 
your brain, ranging in difficulty from three to a 
maximum of 30 steps. In addition, there are random 
puzzles, giving the game virtually limitless 
replay value. An excellent challenge for hardcore 
puzzle fans, Lights Out may leave other gamers in 
the dark.

Lost World, The - Jurassic Park (1997) (71-704) 
(c) 1997 Tiger Electronics, Inc. / Tiger 
Electronics, Inc. 
 
The Lost World: Jurassic Park takes place on a 
secret island known as Site B. Before Jurassic 
Park failed, this was the island that was used to 
supply the dinosaur park with its creatures. In 
this game, you control either Roland Tembo, a 
hunter wanting to take dinosaur eggs back to the 
main land, or Sarah Harding, an anthropologist 
wanting to retrieve the dinosaur eggs and keep 
them out of Tembo's hands.Each of the six levels 
in this game is divided into two sections: Game 
Trail and Nest Area. In the Game Trail portions of 
the game, you must drive along a dirt, grass or 
gravel road, avoiding dinosaurs as they stampede 
past you. You must also watch for rocks, bushes 
and other road hazards. The Game Trail is viewed 
from a first-person perspective. Vehicles at your 
disposal include a motorcycle, an RV mobile lab, 
an RV 3, a humvee cargo carrier, a humvee snagger 
and a humvee.The Nest Area is a platform adventure 
contest in which you must search for five dinosaur 
eggs. As you run, climb, crawl and jump through 
the jungles, an arrow indicator points in the 
direction of the next egg. Since you are intruding 
in their habitat, dinosaurs will attack you. To 
help ward them off, you will be issued 
tranquilizer darts. If you play as Harding, you 
will also have flares. Tembo's alternate weapon is 
a sonic screamer.After finding all five eggs in a 
Nest Area, you must find the exit. Be careful, 
though, because the Mother Dinosaur will be on 
guard. 
 
Review by Brett Alan Weiss 
 
The Lost World: Jurassic Park looks fantastic. The 
jungles are thick and detailed, huge dinosaurs 
roam the backgrounds and nicely drawn all-terrain 
vehicles cruise around assorted obstacles while 
dodging sprinting dinosaurs. This is a lot going 
on for a black-and-white portable system. 
Unfortunately, the over-abundance of graphical 
content can get in the way of the action. The 
foreground dinosaurs oftentimes blend in with some 
of the shorter trees, especially when the 
playfield is scrolling, and the busy backgrounds 
only add to the confusion.Like most game.com 
games, The Lost World: Jurassic Park has superior 
sound effects. Powerful dinosaur growls emit from 
the tiny speaker. The music, however, is 
lightweight for a game of this type.In terms of 
shear action, the game is mediocre. Searching for 
the dinosaur eggs is a workable and challenging 
concept, but poor controls steal much of the 
enjoyment. When you push the jump button, your 
character waits a moment before jumping. This can 
be very frustrating. The driving scenes are 
largely pointless, but they look good and they are 
a change of pace from the standard gameplay.When 
you do find all five eggs in a level, you will 
have a feeling of accomplishment. It can be a 
difficult task. Even if the graphics don't confuse 
you, it is hard to keep the dinosaurs from killing 
you.The Lost World: Jurassic Park is a decent 
game, but Alien 3 for Sega's portable Game Gear is 
far superior. Alien 3 has accurate controls, 
better monster-killing action and superior 
weapons. 
 
Graphics (6) 
The visuals are impressive, but they can confuse 
the action. 
 
Sound (6) 
The dinosaurs sound great, but the music is wimpy. 
 
Enjoyment (4) 
I enjoyed exploring the jungles and finding the 
eggs, but the controls could use some fine-tuning, 
and another, more powerful weapon wouldn't hurt. 
 
Replay Value (3) 
Once you beaten this game, you'll probably feel 
that you've had enough.

The manual explains things fairly well.

Monopoly (1999) (71-752) (c) 1999 Tiger 
Electronics, Inc. / Tiger Electronics, Inc. 
 
Based on the classic board game of the same name, 
Monopoly for the game.com lets up to six gamers 
compete to become the richest player while 
bankrupting all the other players. When it's your 
turn, you must roll the dice to determine how many 
spaces to move your token around the board. If you 
land on a property, you will be given the chance 
put it up for auction or buy it if it isn't 
already owned. You can also purchase railroads and 
utilities.If you own all two or three properties 
in a particular group (such as Boardwalk and Park 
Place), you can begin building houses on them. 
After you have built four houses on one property, 
you can then upgrade to one hotel. When an 
opponent lands on your property, he or she must 
pay you rent. If you don't have enough money to 
purchase a property, you can raise cash by 
mortgaging property or selling houses or hotels. 
You can also attempt to trade properties with 
other players.There are several non-property 
squares you may land on. These include Chance and 
Community Chest, which have you draw a card and 
follow the instructions, Go! which when landed on 
or passed will grant you money, and Tax, which 
insists that you pay the amount indicated. Other 
squares include Jail, Just Visiting and Free 
Parking. To get out of jail, you must roll 
doubles, pay $50 or use a "Get Out of Jail Free" 
card.This version of Monopoly lets you turn on or 
off a number of options. These include the 
following: Short Game (in which players begin with 
several properties), Landing on Go Doubles Salary, 
Have Auctions for Properties (that are landed on 
and not bought), One Lap Required Before 
Purchasing, Infinite Buildings in Bank (as opposed 
to 32 houses and 12 hotels) and Transactions 
Allowed from Jail. You can also decide whether or 
not you want sound and animation.You go bankrupt 
in Monopoly and thus forfeit the game if you owe 
rent to another player and lack the assets to pay.

Mortal Kombat Trilogy (1997) (71-711) (c) 1998 
Tiger Electronics, Inc. 
 
What do you get when you cross 2D fighters Mortal 
Kombat, Mortal Kombat II and Mortal Kombat 3? Why, 
Mortal Kombat Trilogy, of course!The successor to 
the arcade megahits, Mortal Kombat Trilogy 
continues their bloody, ruthlessly violent 
tradition, this time in handheld form. The game 
features Rayden, Kitana, Reptile, Shao Kahn (the 
Dark Emperor scheming to control Earth) and seven 
other Kombatants from the earlier Mortal Kombat 
games. Familiar backgrounds are included as 
well.Each of the fighters in this game can punch, 
kick (low and high), block, crouch, jump and run. 
You can experiment with the controls to "chain" 
certain moves together to create combos, which 
reel off a flurry of attacks against the opponent. 
In addition to fighting moves and combos, each 
character possesses expert special moves such as 
Lightning, Teleport Kick, Forceball, Hatchet 
Uppercut, and Shoulder Dash.Fights in this game 
are played out in a one-on-one, best 
two-out-of-three format. Meters at the top of the 
screen display each character's degree of health. 
Every time you are hit, your Health Meter 
diminishes. If you land enough hits on your 
opponent, you will fill your Aggressor Meter, 
which makes you much stronger and able to inflict 
heavier damage on your opponent.Four skill levels 
are available in Mortal Kombat Trilogy: Very Easy, 
Easy, Medium and Hard. There are also four 
destinies (Novice, Warrior, Master and Champion) 
from which to choose. You can turn the Blood, 
Timer and Aggressor modes on or off. Play modes 
include Tournament, which has you battling your 
way up the food chain of Kombatants, and VS. 
Kombat, which pits you against a human opponent. 
To play against a friend, you must have two 
game.com systems, two Mortal Kombat Trilogy 
cartridges, and a Head 2 Head link cable.

Quiz Wiz - Cyber Trivia (1997) (71-524) (c) 1997 
Tiger Electronics, Inc. / Tiger Electronics, Inc. 
 
Unlike video game versions of Jeopardy, which wrap 
the trivialities and tidbits of interesting 
information inside a fun and engrossing game show 
format, Quiz Wiz is simply a series questions and 
answers. Up to three players can compete, but 
there are no bonus rounds, no prize packages, and 
no nifty game boards. More than 1,500 
multiple-choice questions are spread among five 
categories: sports, famous people, film and TV, 
potpourri, and general knowledge. The host looks 
pretty decent and speaks clearly (if redundantly), 
and the animations are choppy and repetitive. 
Worse, too many of the questions are unnecessarily 
easy, making even the least informed gamer feel 
like a whiz kid. 
 
Review by Brett Alan Weiss 
 
The packaging for Quiz Wiz says that it is a game 
of "cyber trivia" and that it is a "really cool 
way to widen your wisdom." Quiz Wiz is indeed a 
trivia contest, but you'll hardly gain wisdom by 
answering questions about Family Ties, NBA 
basketball and Cindy Crawford. The game does have 
questions about science, history and other 
substantive subjects, but you won't need the 
wisdom of King Solomon to be good at answering the 
questions, just a well-rounded knowledge of 
popular culture, both past and present.Company 
hyperbole aside, Quiz Wiz is little more than a 
trivia book in disguise. Unlike video game 
versions of Jeopardy, which wrap the trivialities 
and tidbits of interesting information inside a 
fun and engrossing game show format, Quiz Wiz is 
simply a series of questions and answers. Up to 
three players can compete, but there are no bonus 
rounds, no prize packages and no nifty game 
boards. In other words, Quiz Wiz can be as boring 
as school.Cutting edge graphics aren't exactly the 
first thing you look for in a trivia game, but the 
host of Quiz Wiz is recognizable as the Gen-Xer 
wannabe on the box. On the other hand, the 
animations that transpire as the result of an 
answered (right or wrong) question are choppy and 
redundant, and the questions and answers are 
presented in simple text.The voice effects are 
clear, but they're as redundant as the animations. 
The introductory music, which features jamming 
electric guitars, is designed to give the game an 
air of coolness, just like the box. Perhaps it's 
hard to get teenagers, the primary players of 
video games, to think a trivia contest is 
cool.Some of the questions in this game are way 
too easy. For example, when the game presents the 
question of how many keys are on a piano, its 
multiple choice answers are 2, 5, 88, and 1,899. 
Obviously, the answer is 88. Why not throw in 99, 
101 or another reasonable number as one of the 
answers, just to make the question challenging? 
The trivia itself, though, isn't the real problem 
with Quiz Wiz as there are plenty of questions 
that ride the fine line of the esoteric and the 
familiar. The real problem with this game lies in 
its format: there is no real game here, just a 
bunch of questions and answers.There is one use 
for Quiz Wiz not yet mentioned. No, it can't be 
used as a doorstop as it is much too small. The 
game is actually ideal for long trips, especially 
since the whole family can get involved. You'll 
find questions involving subjects ranging from 
professional boxing to soap operas to rap music to 
The Roy Rogers Show to the Solar System. You can 
pass the game all around the car, letting each 
player have a turn

Sonic Jam (1998) (71-734) (c) 1998 Tiger 
Electronics, Inc. / Tiger Electronics, Inc. 
 
Sonic leaves the Genesis, Game Gear and Saturn to 
star in his first game on a non-Sega console 
system. Sonic Jam, which is also available on the 
32-bit Saturn, is a compilation of Sonic's past 
efforts, including Sonic the Hedgehog 2, Sonic the 
Hedgehog 3 and Sonic & Knuckles. Players are free 
to choose between the famous blue mascot, his best 
friend Miles Prower (a.k.a. Tails) or the wonder 
from down under, Knuckles the Echidna. Levels are 
taken from each of the aforementioned 16-bit games 
as players make their way from left to right while 
jumping, spinning and moving at high-speeds to 
reach the end of the level.At the end of each zone 
(which consists of three levels or acts), Dr. 
Robotnik will appear to make things difficult for 
Sonic and his pals. Defeat Robotnik and you'll be 
able to advance to other zones, each differing in 
theme and enemy characters. The various enemies 
you'll confront are robotic versions of real-life 
animals, which can be "freed" from their machinery 
by using your character's standard spin 
attack.Grab rings to add to your score, but 
prepare to lose them if you collide with an enemy 
character or hazard (such as spikes). Once you 
lose all your rings, the next hit will cost you 
one of your three lives! Sonic Jam for the 
game.com also saves your best scores through each 
zone, so you can play each one over again to 
improve on past performances.

Tiger Casino (1998) (71-731) (c) 1997 Tiger 
Electronics, Inc. 
 
Tiger Casino gives you Vegas-style gambling in the 
palms of your hands. Five games are included: 
Video Poker, Video Black Jack, HI-LOW, Slots and 
Roulette.In Video Poker, the computer deals you 
five cards. You can keep some or all of the cards 
or have the computer replace the cards you don't 
want. Your objective is to get one of 11 good 
hands (card combinations) that will net you some 
cash. The better hands include Royal Flush (the 
five highest cards in any one suit), Straight 
Flush (five cards of the same suit in consecutive 
order), and Full House (two cards of one value and 
three of another).Video Black Jack is the old game 
of 21. The computer deals you and itself two cards 
each. Your objective is to get as close to 21 
without going over. When it's your turn, you must 
decide if you want to hit (take another card), 
stand (keep only the cards you have) or double 
(take only one additional card while doubling your 
bet).HI-LOW is a basic game in which you and the 
computer each draw one card to see who gets the 
highest card. If you tie, you will go to war, bets 
will automatically double, and two more cards will 
be dealt.In Roulette, a small ball is rolled on a 
wheel that has many slots of different numbers and 
colors. If you can guess (by placing chips on a 
board) correctly which number and color the ball 
will land in, you will win a cash prize. Size of 
the reward depends on how much you bet and in what 
configuration.There are two types of slot machines 
in Slots -- Slots O' Fruit and T-Rex Slots. Your 
job on each machine is to crank a lever that will 
set tumblers spinning. If you are lucky and line 
up three of the same item, you'll win big bucks 
(amount depends on size of bet and type of item). 
Items include lemons, bells, oranges, plums, bars, 
cherries, tigers and T-Rexs.A password feature 
lets you save your total score and how well you 
have performed at each game. The password screen 
also keeps track of your time spent in the casino. 
When setting up a round of Tiger Casino, you can 
choose how much money and credit you will begin 
with. Since you've already shelled out money for 
the game cartridge (not to mention the game.com 
system), why not go for broke?

Based on the world famous game show of the same 
name, Wheel of Fortune for the game.com puts the 
wheel-spinning, letter-turning action in the palm 
of your hand.Just like in the television show, you 
spin a giant wheel while facing a wall of hidden 
letters which spell out a word or series of words. 
If the wheel lands on a dollar amount or a FREE 
SPIN, you can guess a consonant or buy a vowel. If 
you guess a consonant correctly in the puzzle, you 
score points and get to continue spinning. If you 
are successful in purchasing a vowel, you don't 
get any cash, but you will be that much closer to 
solving the puzzle, which you may do at any time 
while it is your turn.If you spin the wheel and it 
lands on BANKRUPT, you lose all your money and it 
will be the next person's turn. If the wheel lands 
on LOSE A TURN, you don't lose money, but you 
don't get to guess a letter or try to solve the 
puzzle on that particular turn.You can play Wheel 
of Fortune by yourself or with one or two friends. 
After the end of a round, which consists of three 
puzzles, you will enter a bonus round. There are 
750 puzzles in all. The categories include: Before 
and After, Phrase, Thing, Things, Person, Proper 
Name, People, Event, Same Name, Landmark, 
Quotation, Occupation, Title, Place and Star/Role. 
 
Review by Brett Alan Weiss 
 
Both Vanna White and Pat Sajack are conspicuously 
absent from this rendition of Wheel of Fortune, 
but the game does manage to play enough like the 
real thing to please fans of the show. The basic 
wheel-spinning, letter-guessing, puzzle-solving 
action is largely intact. If you enjoy watching 
Wheel of Fortune, then you'll likely have an even 
better time playing this game. Instead of just 
yelling at the TV, imploring your favorite 
contestant to guess a particular letter that you 
know is in the puzzle, you can simply do it 
yourself. While it's true that you won't hear (or 
see) Pat or Vanna in this game, the studio 
audience makes takes up the slack. They call out 
"Wheel of Fortune!" at the beginning of the game, 
they moan and groan when the wheel lands on 
BANKRUPT and they cheer with genuine delight when 
you solve a puzzle. The rest of the sound effects 
are equally impressive. The spinning and clicking 
of the wheel are very realistic, and the chiming 
sounds are near-perfect.Wheel of Fortune is 
available for many consoles and handheld units. 
One advantage this version has over other Wheel of 
Fortune translations is the game.com's 
touch-sensitive screen. Instead of having to guide 
a cursor over a sequence of letters, you simply 
touch the letter you want. This feature is not 
only convenient, it is fun to use.Wheel of Fortune 
is one of the more enjoyable game.com titles, but 
a couple of things keep it from greatness. First 
of all, the computer is not very good at the game. 
Unless you get unlucky and land on BANKRUPT too 
many times, you will win far more often than you 
will lose. You'd better find a willing (and 
intelligent) partner if you want a real 
challenge.Secondly, there are only 750 puzzles in 
the game. Compare this to better than 1,000 in the 
NES version. Even the game.com's own Quiz Wiz has 
more than 1,500 trivia questions.Sprawling, 
visually complex action/adventure games oftentimes 
don't translate well to portable systems. With 
their teeny tiny screens and black-and-white 
graphics, the Game Boys and game.coms of the world 
are generally better suited to puzzle games such 
as Tetris, word or trivia games such as Jeopardy 
or non-scrolling, graphically simplistic classics 
such as Joust. So it's no surprise that Wheel of 
Fortune is indeed a winner on the game.com.

The contestants are a diverse mix of digitized 
head shots. The playfield is simplistic, but it

Williams Arcade Classics (1997) (71-722) (c) 1997 
Tiger Electronics, Inc. / Tiger Electronics, Inc. 
 
Williams Arcade Classics for the game.com does a 
hit-and-miss job of cramming five all-time greats 
into one tiny cartridge. Defender and Defender II 
are hampered by slowdown, and Sinistar and 
Robotron: 2084 are fun to play, but awkward to 
control. Joust, on the other hand, is near 
perfect. The animation is smooth, the original 
playfield has been painstakingly re-created in 
fine detail, and the control system is ideally 
suited to the game.com control pad. The most 
impressive thing about this collection is its loud 
and proud sound effects, such as the faithful 
reproduction of Sinistar's memorable monster 
mantra: "Beware, I live." 
 
Review by Brett Alan Weiss 
 
Joust has the best animation and is the most 
faithfully recreated port in this collection. The 
birds move smoothly, and the control system for 
the original Joust is ideally suited to the 
game.com control pad. Also, the playfield has been 
painstakingly recreated with fine detail, such as 
the nicely drawn pterodactyl and the fiery hand 
coming up out of the lava pit. My only beef with 
this game is that your character looks too much 
like the enemy when both are in flight.All the 
games featured in this compilation have powerful, 
arcade-like sound effects, especially Sinistar. 
Amazingly, the memorable monster mantra of 
"Beware, I live" has been faithfully reproduced. 
Sinistar has sluggish controls, making it hard to 
gather crystals, but the gameplay is similar 
enough to the original to please most gamers. 
Overall, it is a fun game, but it could use a 
faster or easier to control ship.The original 
Robotron: 2084 appears on many gamers' all-time 
top-ten lists. It is a blood, sweat and tears kind 
of shooter featuring non-stop action. The game.com 
rendition is not bad, but the controls are 
awkward, and the intensity level has been knocked 
down a few notches. All things considered, it is a 
successful port.Defender and Defender II are a tad 
too similar for my tastes, but they are both 
enjoyable. You get all of the side-scrolling 
action, the helpless humanoids, the diversity of 
the aliens and the killer weaponry. Unlike the 
Arcade games, which are flawless creations, these 
versions suffer tremendously from 
slowdown.Considering the inherent limitations of a 
black-and-white handheld system, the designers of 
Williams Arcade Classics for the game.com did 
about as good a job as could be expected with this 
compilation. The titles represented in this 
cartridge, especially Defender and Robotron: 2084, 
are based on some of the most beloved Arcade games 
ever made. 
 
Graphics (6) 
The games look a lot like the originals, but much 
of the animation is choppy. 
 
Sound (9) 
The sound effects are incredibly faithful to the 
source material. 
 
Enjoyment (6) 
Each of the games in this collection offer a 
substantial amount of enjoyment. 
 
Replay Value (7) 
This cartridge boasts a whopping five titles while 
most Game Boy classic Arcade compilations have 
just two games. 
 
Documentation (5) 
The manual needs a color other than red and white, 
but it does give adequate information.
