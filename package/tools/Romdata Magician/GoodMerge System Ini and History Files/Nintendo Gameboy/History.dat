007 - The World is Not Enough (c) Sep, 2001 2n 
Productions / Electronic Arts, Inc. 
 
007: The World is Not Enough is based off of the 
1999 James Bond film of the same name. In it, 
Pierce Brosnan's Bond must investigate the murder 
of a British oil tycoon and attacks on his new 
pipeline, which leads to a larger sinister plot 
requiring gunplay and frequent flier miles to 
diffuse. 
 
In contrast to the Nintendo 64 and Playstation 
versions, this game only has eight missions and 
features a 2D overhead view instead of a 3D 
first-person. There is no multiplayer, no 
difficulty levels, and no save feature. Passwords 
are used to skip to later levels and unlock 
certain cheats.

Action Man - Search for Base X (c) 2001 Natsume 
Co., Ltd. / THQ Inc. 
 
Alex "Action Man" Mann makes a stop over onto the 
Game Boy Color where once again he must stop the 
world from falling into the clutches of the evil 
Dr. X.  The player takes control of Action Man as 
they travel through seven different levels ranging 
for jungles to the Arctic, battling an army of 
robots with a variety of weapons and battle suits 
in search of Base X and stop Dr. X from launching 
a terrifying new weapon that could very well bring 
an end to the world. 
 
The gameplay is a standard side-scrolling action 
platformer where the player advances throughout 
the level, destroying enemies and avoiding pit 
falls.  Along the way they can pick up more 
powerful guns as well as a bow and arrow and even 
different suits that can help them on their quest. 
 Additionally, players can find these weapons and 
suits by taking different paths throughout the 
levels.

Les Aventures De TinTin - Le Temple du Soleil (c) 
2000 Infogrames Europe SA / Infogrames Europe SA 
 
The Adventures of Tintin: Prisoners of the Sun is 
based on the Belgian comic book of the same name. 
The basic plotline is the same: Professor Cuthbert 
Calculus gets kidnapped and the player, in the 
role of Tintin, needs to rescue him. The rest is 
more loosely adapted: in contrast to the comic, 
which is mostly based in Peru, this game offers 
many different locations all over the world. 
 
The gameplay itself is a typical platforming 
action: Tintin walks through the levels while 
avoiding the enemies. Pretty much everyone, e.g. 
little girls and security guards, is out to hurt 
Tintin who has no means of defending himself. This 
means the most important aspect is learning enemy 
placements, their patterns and how to avoid them. 
But he has to hurry because of the time limit. 
Required for success is the usage of the two 
playing plains: from the player's perspective in 
the foreground and further towards the background. 
Tintin can switch between the two at any time.

Obelix (c) 1999 Bit Managers / Infogrames 
Multimedia SA 
 
Being the predecessor of Asterix and Obelix for 
SNES, this game features the same story as it's 
later counterpart - however the level design was 
massively changed, doesn't offer a 2 player mode 
and level codes were added only for the GameBoy 
Color version. 
 
To show Caesar the power and freedom of your 
village, you have to collect various trophies from 
all over Europe. To do this, you can select 
Asterix or Obelix and move them through various 
levels while beating up Roman soldiers, collecting 
coins and avoiding gaps or other obstacles. 
Various special levels like crossing the sea to 
Great Britain by boat (and beating up some Romans 
again) or freeing Rugby players captured by the 
Romans are scattered across the game and provide 
variety between the classical Jump 'n Run levels. 
Most levels additionally have a time limit to make 
things a bit harder, though the difficulty of the 
game can be adjusted. 
 
There's an overall of four different countries, 
all of them based on comic books of the series 
(namely: Asterix in Britain, Asterix in 
Switzerland, Asterix at the Olympic Games, Asterix 
in Spain). At the end of each of these stages you 
have to contend in a contest typical for the 
country and also taken from the plot of the 
comics: In Britannia you take part in a rugby 
match, in Switzerland you have to blast safes, in 
Greece you take part in the Olympic games and in 
Spain you have to fight against (or run from) a 
bull - victory will get you the desired trophy!

Asterix - Search for Dogmatix (c) May, 2000 
Rebellion Developments Ltd. / Infogrames Europe SA 
 
Asterix and Obelix (based on the French comic book 
series), must embark on a journey from the forests 
of France to the coliseums of Rome. Their goal is 
to find Obelix's lovable pet dog, Dogmatix. 
Players take control of Asterix or Obelix, and 
run, jump and punch through various well-drawn and 
colorful levels in this side-scrolling adventure 
game. 
 
This title is somewhat non-linear, and allows 
players to choose the order in which to visit 
stages, as well as the numerous mini-games. The 
stage-select screen is a mini-map, and after 
selecting to play either Asterix or Obelix, 
players can visit the boss arena, the inn (extra 
energy, hints and passwords are found here), as 
well as the the local mini-game. These mini-games 
become available from the title-screen under the 
"Instant Fun" option. They vary from a "Memory" 
style shield-matching game to humorous events such 
as "Throw a Roman Mini Game". 
 
Both Asterix and Obelix play differently as they 
have individual abilities and limitations. Asterix 
is more nimble, can run faster and jump higher, 
whereas Obelix is more powerful (being able to 
bash through some walls) but noticeably slower. 
These differences are highlighted by the obstacles 
presented in the stages - there are many jumps to 
make as well as many enemies (Roman soldiers, 
boars, centurions) to dispose of. In the quest to 
find Dogmatix, it is vital to collect keys hidden 
within the levels to make available new areas. 
Similarly, it is also important to collect coins 
from beaten enemies as they allow the purchases at 
each inn, (which is aptly manned by Getafix 
himself!).

Asteroids (c) 1999 Syrox Developments, Ltd. / 
Activision, Inc. 
 
Unlike Activision's earlier remake of an Atari 
arcade classic, Battlezone, this one stays close 
to its namesake.  Take the original, Atari coin-op 
game Asteroids, add in the features of the Atari 
2600 cartridge, then give it 3-D graphics and a 
bunch of power-ups, and you've got Activision's 
Asteroids remake. 
 
You are an employee of the Astro-Mining 
Corporation.  Your mission is to simply go to an 
assigned area of space and clear the area of 
asteroids and the occassional debris.  The game 
consists of five zones, each with a different 
background and some with special features.  Each 
zone has 15 levels.  In addition to the standard 
asteroids, there are also mined asteroids that 
explode

The huge Monster Tower stands near the village 
Monsbaiya. It is populated by vicious monsters, 
and few dare enter it. But the monsters in the 
tower lay eggs, and whoever takes possession of 
such an egg, can tame a monster which will come 
out of it, and those monsters, called "familiars", 
will help their tamers in times of danger. Some 
brave adventurers dared to enter the tower and to 
take the eggs. One of them was called Guy. He was 
killed in the monster tower. Now his son Koh is 
fifteen, and he is allowed to try his luck in the 
tower. 
 
You control Koh and his party of "familiars" in 
this unusual "monster-taming" RPG. You must 
capture the eggs from the tower, bring them home, 
grow monsters and tame them. During battles, you 
assign different commands to them. Different 
species have different abilities and need 
different approach. The battles system is a 
mixture of real time and turn based combat. Unlike 
most other console RPGs, there are no special 
battle screens.

Babe and Friends (c) Nov 30, 1999 Aqua Pacific 
Ltd.|David A. Palmer Productions / Crave 
Entertainment, Inc. 
 
Babe the Pig, of the eponymous movies, was raised 
by sheepdogs and, hence, believes himself to be a 
"sheep-pig", who herds sheep as his foster parents 
do.  In this game, you control the plucky little 
porker and direct his sheep management attempts, 
driving them forward toward the goal in 
exaggerated, frictionless Soko-Ban or Boulder Dash 
style with porcine barks until their movement is 
halted or altered should their course intercept an 
obstacle such as a fencepost, moveable haystack, 
pit or trampoline. 
 
Babe is given hints and tips in these efforts by 
lovable characters from both of his feature films, 
and the 40 levels borrow inspiration both from the 
calm pastoral setting of the first and the surreal 
urban folly of its sequel.  While the measured 
puzzles are a far cry from the excitement of the 
movies, the material finds a surprisingly good fit 
in this unexpected genre -- or otherwise put, 
"that'll do, pig."

Ballistic (c) 1999 Mitchell Corporation / 
Infogrames, Inc. 
 
Ballistic is a puzzle game in which the player 
must place 3 patterned balls next to each other in 
order to clear them. It is somewhat similar to 
Puyo Puyo in this respect. However Ballistic 
places the player in the center of the screen 
shooting the balls outward. In Panic! mode, a 
constant string of balls appear and the player 
must keep destroying similar balls to keep the 
string short and prevent it from snaking around 
and reaching the middle of the screen. In 
Checkmate mode, a limited amount of balls are 
given to the player which they must use to destroy 
all the balls on the screen. Strategy is used here 
since the amount of balls destroyed must be 
maximized. 
 
Ballistic also features a versus mode in which 
players can challenge one another. Similar to 
other puzzle games versus modes, one player's 
success results in additional balls on the other 
player's screen which they then must clear.

floated away on a big bunch of balloons. It's up 
to you to chase after him through 8 treacherous

that allow you to float through the level. You 
must control your height carefully by tapping the 
'A' button. Meanwhile, the screen is always 
scrolling to the left, and you have to keep up. 
 
In addition to the single player adventure, there 
is a 2-player mode that allows you to compete 
against a friend via the Game Boy link cable.  In 
this mode you try to get your opponent to maneuver 
their balloon kid into the various level hazards.

Bibi Blocksberg - Im Bann der Hexenkugel (c) 2001 
BVM Produktion GmbH / KIDDINX Entertainment GmbH 
 
Bibi Blocksberg is the star of a German children's 
radio play and TV series. She is an apprentice 
witch, living in the common world of today, who 
has to live through different adventures. 
 
The story: During a witch meeting, a lightning 
bolt struck and broke a crystal ball in seven 
parts, causing the witches to go mad. Bibi 
Blocksberg now has find all the parts to put them 
together and to restore the witches' mental 
health. 
 
The game is an action-adventure. The seven levels, 
each corresponding to one witch and one part of 
the crystal ball, are full of monsters which hurt 
Bibi when she touches them. The health can be 
restored by finding sweets hidden in the level. 
Apart of monsters, there are persons which help 
her. In each level there is a magical item, often 
reachable only after getting through a little 
"game in game", that expands Bibi's magical 
powers, for example the broom that allows her to 
fly. The magic has to be used sparsely, because it 
costs magical energy, which can be recharged by 
finding little pulsating dots. This magical item 
is needed to get to the witch of the level, which 
Bibi has to fight. If she wins, the witch gets 
back to normal, gives her a part of the crystal 
ball and Bibi can go the the next level. 
 
There also is a password system that allows the 
player to jump to different situations in the 
game, so that one does not have to play it through 
in one session.

Bibi und Tina: Fohlen "Felix" in Gefahr is an

In this game, you play the part(s) of Bibi and 
Tina, two German cartoon stars. In the intro, you 
discover that the foal Felix has disappeared, 
apparently stolen, and you set out to find him 
again. 
 
This task takes you through six levels. In each 
level, you play the part of either Bibi or Tina. 
Be careful, there are enemies which you should not 
touch – this costs life energy, which can be 
restored by gathering horseshoes. The task is to 
find some clue where Felix has gone, as well as 
finding three sacks of horse food so that you can 
ride on to the next location. There are several 
little mini-games you have to master to get some 
item or clue. 
 
To get to there, there is a side-scrolling arcade 
sequence where Bibi and Tina are racing each other 
and where you have to jump obstacles.

Much like Pokémon before it, Max: Blue is one part 
of the adventure (the other being Max: Red

pick up "Charabombs", creatures that you can raise 
as your own, and fight against other players 
Charabombs. It's a simple bonus game of 
Rock/Paper/Scissors, but the only way to complete 
the entire adventure is by linking both games 
together via link cable and pass over levels from 
one cart to the other, as each game has unique 
levels, so as to collect all of the Charabombs. 
 
In Max: Blue you play as Bomberman himself, with

The task stays the same, plant bombs to destroy 
blocks and enemies in your way, as well as 
collecting Charabombs, creatures who act much the 
same as Pokémon where you raise the Charabombs and 
fight against other players. Certain Charabombs

Bounced (c) 2000 Karma Studios / Midas Interactive 
Entertainment Ltd 
 
Bounced is a arcade platform game in which you 
play a bouncing ball. In the world of Ditnia all 
the Dits used to bounce around, until a mysterious 
evil force field turned them all tired and 
bounce-less. All except the main character Dito. 
As Dito you have to bounce to the top of 32 
levels, in order to return the status quo. You do 
do this by bouncing on top of your bounce-less 
Dits, which gains you kinetic energy. The Dits 
don't sit around quietly however, so you have to 
aim well or lose bounce height.

Bubble Bobble (c) Nov 30, 1999 Taito Corporation / 
Metro3D, Inc. 
 
Bubble Bobble is the story of two humans, Bub and 
Bob who wander into the mysterious cave of 
monsters and magically turn into dinosaurs. The 
only way to transform back is to reach the end of 
the cave... 
 
Bubble Bobble is a platform game, with each level 
being a single screen. The enemies must be cleared 
from a level to go to the next one. With one 
player controlling Bub and the other controlling 
Bob, the player can jump and collect items for 
points (such as fruit). The real power Bub and Bob 
have however is the ability to blow bubbles. These 
bubbles can be as platforms to leap on, or to trap 
enemies. Enemies trapped in a bubble must be 
popped by jumping into them, wherein they'll turn 
to fruit. Additionally, power-ups sometimes float 
by in bubbles. They include lightning, which flies 
out horizontally at enemies, and water, which 
drags the player and enemies straight down flowing 
over platforms. Taking too long to complete any 
level will summon Baron Von Blubba, who will float 
around the screen trying to destroy the player.

Guide a team of up to four soldiers through 72 
levels of combat in this innovative top-down 
action/strategy hybrid, best thought of as 
Lemmings crossed with Commando crossed with Dune 
2. The characters are controlled indirectly using 
the mouse, as you activate each soldier or group 
of them by highlighting them, click the left 
button to move them to a particular spot, and the 
right button for them to fire guns at an enemy. 
You can also pick up grenades, which can be used 
to destroy groups of enemies or buildings (by 
pressing both buttons at once). 
 
Each mission has a specific objective, and some 
feature vehicles such as tanks to make things 
easier. Your troops can cross water but can't 
shoot within it, so finding and controlling 
bridges is often crucial. You can use the 
arrangement of trees to find hiding places to 
shoot from, and should watch out for CPU soldiers 
also doing so.

Carmageddon (c) Feb 29, 2000 Sales Curve Ltd., The 
/ Titus France SA 
 
Motorized carnage.  Ever wanted to hit pedestrians 
during a race?  Now's your chance. Carmageddon is 
an ultra-violent racing game which caused much 
controversy during the '90s but was also very 
popular due to its fun factor. It was also one of 
the first batch of games to make use of 3D 
accelerated graphics (using OpenGL and 3dfx Voodoo 
cards). 
 
At the beginning of the game the player only has 
one car and is ranked at #99. The overall 
objective is to race all the way to the top, 
collecting the opponents' cars on the way as 
trophies (and possibly replacements to his 
vehicle). In the race itself the player tries to 
damage opponents by driving into them, and can 
also kill pedestrians. Damage, kills and 
spectacular moves earn credits for the player 
which can be used for upgrades and even making 
repairs to the car at anytime during the race. If 
you wreck a certain car in 4 races or so, you get 
to drive it. There are many power-ups strewn 
around the courses which range from useful to fun 
to downright absurd. Though the player can win by 
racing fairly and normally, most players found it 
much more fun to wreck everything in sight. 
 
Carmageddon is a violent game which is probably 
not suitable for minors.

Centipede (c) Nov 30, 1998 Morning Star Multimedia 
/ Majesco Sales, Inc. 
 
In Centipede, the player is trapped in the 
Enchanted Forest. Armed with only a magic wand to 
ward off the forest's insect denizens, all of 
which apparently are attacking in the player in 
continuous waves. 
 
The player must use the magic wand to shoot sparks 
at approaching insects to score points by pressing 
the controller button. Holding down the controller 
button will set the wand to rapid fire shots. If 
the player is bitten by an insect, the player will 
be temporarily paralyzed and lose one of the three 
starting magic wands. 
 
Insect Opponents and Mushrooms 
All enemy insects have a distinctive sound before 
attacking, which may help the player identify 
which insect is attacking. Enemies and objects in 
the game are as the following: 
 
1. The Centipede 
The Centipede will attack in 12 waves. In the 
first wave, the Centipede will have a head 
attached to 11 body segments. In the second wave, 
the Centipede will have a head attached to 10 body 
segments, in addition to a detached head. The 
third wave will have the Centipede with an 
attached head, 9 body segments, plus two detached 
heads. These body segments will transform into 
heads and continue to do so until Wave 12. In the 
last wave, the Centipede will have 12 detached 
heads, independently attacking the player. 
Centipede heads are worth more points than body 
segments. 
 
Attacks from the Centipede will come from the top 
of the screen, moving downward. If a spark hits 
any part of the Centipede, that particular body 
segment will transform into a mushroom, while the 
body segment behind it will become the new 
Centipede head. When the Centipede is destroyed, 
it will briefly disappear and re-appear from the 
top of the screen again. 
 
The Spider 
The Spider will attempt to distract the player 
from attacking the Centipede. It will destroy any 
mushroom it touches. Spiders will score more 
points if it is hit in closer distances. 
 
The Flea 
The Flea will appear if the player has destroyed 
most of the existing mushrooms. It will drop down 
creating a new batch of mushrooms where it falls. 
The Flea will disappear after two hits. After the 
first hit, the Flea will drop down much faster. 
 
The Scorpion 
The Scorpion will appear in the third wave. It 
moves slowly but will pick up speed, moving 
faster. While doing so, it will poison any 
mushroom it touches. 
 
Mushrooms 
Mushrooms fill the Enchanted Forest and may act as 
obstacles or cover for the player, with added 
effects to enemy insects. It takes for shots to 
complete destroy a mushroom. There are two type of 
mushrooms: Magic Mushrooms and Poisonous 
mushrooms. Magic mushrooms are the default 
mushrooms in the game and are also the the result 
of the player destroying an insect or Centipede 
body segment. Poisonous Mushrooms are the result 
of the Scorpion touching a mushroom. Poisonous 
Mushrooms will prompt the Centipede near it to 
move straight towards the player through any 
mushroom. Losing a wand will restore any partially 
damaged mushroom. 
 
Game Difficulty and Variations 
The game offers four difficulty levels: Novice, 
Standard, Advanced, and Expert. Game Variations 
are as the following: 
 
1. One Player 
Two Player Alternating 
Two players will take turns when the active player 
is bitten. 
Dual Player Competition 
Two players will appear on the screen at the same 
time. Scoring is separate. Shots fired from one 
player will paralyze the other player. 
Team Play 
Two players will appear on the screen at the same 
time. Scoring is combined. Shots fired from one 
player will not paralyze the other player. 
 
Scoring 
The player will win a bonus magic wand for every 
12,000 points to a maximum of six wands. The game 
will end when all wands are lost. Scoring are as 
the following: 
 
Centipede Head - 100 points 
Centipede Body Segment - 10 points 
Spider at close range - 900 points 
Spider at medium range - 600 points 
Flea - 200 points 
Scorpion - 1,000 points 
Flea - 200 points 
Restored mushroom - 5 points 
Destroyed mushroom - 1 points

call from Dispatch, telling you to arrest suspects 
that have just committed a felony. There are ten 
stages in the game, and each one of them has you 
placing three agents throughout the city. Each one 
of these agents have their own specialties. Once 
you have placed the agents, you must guide one of 
them toward the suspect vehicle. If the vehicle 
goes outside the city, the game is over. 
 
Once the two of you make contact, the battle 
begins where the object is to ram the suspect's 
vehicle until it is disabled. You can also shoot 
the vehicle to further damage it, and use up to 
three turbos to catch up with the vehicle if you 
happen to fall behind.

Ginger, and leads their fellow chickens out of 
dangerous situations by collecting bags of feed 
scattered throughout the stage and use the corn to 
lay a path around obstacles and traps to the 
stage's exit. 
 
It features over 24 levels, ranging from the 
chicken coup to the dreaded pie machine and 
features obstacles such as cameras, dogs, 
spotlights and many more.  Players can also use 
common household items scattered throughout the 
level to aid the player in deactivating various 
traps and help spring their fellow chickens from 
certain doom.

Columns GB - Tezuka Osamu Characters (c) Nov 05,

Columns was to the Game Gear what Tetris was to 
the Game Boy. Some years after the Game Gear had 
ceased production, it was ported to the 'Boy. To 
spice things up, the game has been given several 
game modes, and, most notably, a licence to 
several popular manga characters created by Osamu 
Tezuka. Play as famous characters such as Astro 
Boy, Kimba or Black Jack. 
 
Apart from the main Columns mode, this edition 
features a puzzle mode like that of the Nazo Puyo 
games, where you must remove a set of 
pre-installed pieces using a set of pre-defined 
dropping pieces. There is also a link-up mode for 
battling with friends. 
 
The Tezuka characters play no big role in the 
game, being displayed in a window to the right of 
the playfield, changing mimics according to how 
the game progresses. You have six characters to 
choose from, and three save slots to put them in. 
The save slots let you keep your score for 
upcoming sessions.

while also obtaining the four elemental swords 
which will help him progress. Players gain 
experience and gold from defeating monsters. The 
experience is used to gain levels and improve 
statistics, however a minimum level is required 
before one can do damage to specific bosses. Gold

Cyber Tiger (c) Oct, 2000 Xantera / Electronic

A step back from the Tiger Woods PGA simulation 
style, Cyber Tiger Woods has a more arcade feel to 
it, with cartoony style animations, fast gameplay 
and added elements to make the game of golf more 
fun then the real life counterpart. 
 
Although real life elements are there, including 
full motion capture of Tiger himself, recreations 
of some of the best PGA tour courses, and the full 
range of moves (putting, chipping, driving, etc.), 
arcade elements such as 2 player battle mode, zany 
characters including Little Tiger, and game types 
that have you aiming to knock down the opposing 
character from his platform above a poll of lava, 
and you will soon notice how different Cyber 
really is. 
 
Other game types include a full practise range, 
skins tournaments and stroke play. Plus there are 
hidden characters to unlock, equipment upgrades 
and power-ups plus trick shots you just won't see 
on the PGA tour.

Dancing Furby (c) Dec 24, 1999 Tomy / Tomy 
 
As a furby you must dance! Woo-teh-loh-wah-boo! 
Shake it to the left, shake it to the right. 
 
A Furby is an owl-like monster with fluffy pink 
banana ears. They love to dance, sing, and slowly 
learn human speech. Specifically a Furby is an 
autonomous toy robot manufactured by Tiger 
Electronics, licensor of this game. These toys 
were among the first successful domestic robots. 
Here they will be dancing for you. 
 
Dancing Furby operates as a classic rhythm game, 
with a line of button prompts scrolling across the 
screen that you will have to press when they reach 
the current time mark, supposedly matched with the 
music.  A Furby on screen will dance in accordance 
with your performance, commenting on your timing 
in Furbish, "noo-loo" being perfect, "e-day" being 
acceptable, and "boo" is shrilled for failure. At 
the end of each song you'll have you score 
calculated in "noo-loo"'s etc. and then be allowed 
to continue. 
 
Successfully clearing a stage will result in you 
being able to 'connect' the Game Boy's infrared 
port with the matching port on the forehead of a 
Furby toy. This will impart information about the 
song to your furby teaching it to warble Für Elise 
when you least expect it. 
 
You may also select a Furby to dance with in the 
game, be it spotted, striped, or lozenge-faced. 
Good performance will unlock more Furbies. 
 
Songs in the game include Twinkle Twinkle Little 
Star, Für Elise, and a few 'popular' numbers.

Das Geheimnis der Happy Hippo-Insel (c) May 17, 
2001 Kritzelkratz 3000 GmbH / JoWooD Productions

Das Geheimnis der Happy Hippo Insel ("The Secret 
of Happy Hippo Island") is based on the Happy 
Hippo toy figures hidden in the "Kinder 
Überraschung" ("Kinder Surprise" outside of 
Germany) chocolate eggs by Italian manufacturer 
Ferrero. 
 
The game is a platformer spiced up with a few mini 
games and clearly targeted at younger children. 
You play Max Mutig ("Max Courageous") and must 
find out why the Volcano on Happy Hippo Island has 
suddenly become active again. An important element 
of the game is collecting water drops and putting 
out the fires that result from the volcanic 
eruption. On your way to the volcano you meet 
several of your Hippo friends who will teach you 
new skills such as climbing, diving and throwing 
nuts at dangerous animals. 
 
The game is divided into six areas that consists 
of three levels each. It is not possible to save 
the game

Dave Mirra Freestyle BMX (c) Nov 09, 2000 NEON 
Software GmbH / Acclaim Entertainment, Inc. 
 
Acclaim's foray into trick-based BMX games spawned 
a unique version for the Game Boy Color. 
 
The basic design is the same as in the original 
console title and other post-Tony Hawk extreme 
sports games. In career mode, the player has to 
complete various goals in each level to advance 
and unlock further levels. These goals include 
reaching a certain score through tricks and 
combos, performing special tricks, or collecting 
items. The eight levels (shown in isometric 
perspective) are filled with half- and quarter 
pipes, ramps, rails and many obstacles to perform 
tricks on. Two dozen different tricks are 
available through various button combinations, 
some of which must be unlocked first by finding 
tokens in the levels. 
 
In training mode, unlocked levels can be practiced 
without the time limit present in career mode. 
 
The game also offers a multiplayer mode, where up 
to four players can take turns on a single GBC and 
the player with the highest score or the best 
trick combo wins.

Disney's Beauty and the Beast: A Board Game 
Adventure is a game for the Game Boy Color. There 
are two modes of play. In the first you play on a 
big game board, where each square represents a 
Disney character. When you land on a square you 
play a mini-game against or inspired by him or 
her. For instance if you land on the square 
showing the inventor father you will have to play 
a game where his new log chopping device cuts 
firewood and he has to bounce it across the screen 
on a spring. These mini-games range from 2D 
platform game segments to memory or reflex games. 
There are a total of seven boards to play on. You

Donald Duck - Goin' Quackers (c) Oct, 2000 Ubisoft 
Studios SRL / Ubi Soft Entertainment Software 
 
Released in conjunction with 3D versions on 
consoles, Donald Duck's adventure on the Game Boy 
Color is a traditional side-scrolling platformer. 
 
The evil magician Merlock has kidnapped Duckburg 
Times reporter Daisy Duck. Donald Duck turns to 
Gyro Gearloose for help, who suggests using his 
latest invention: a powerful teleporter. 
Unfortunately, Merlock learns of their plans and 
steals the blueprints to the device. Now Gyro uses 
the unfinished machine to teleport Donald to 
various locations, where he is to find the parts 
of the blueprints, so he may confront Merlock and 
rescue Daisy. 
 
Donald has to face four different worlds, 
including the forests near Duckie Mountain, the 
rooftops of Duckburg, and a haunted house. His 
abilities include jumping on top of enemies to 
defeat or stun them and double-jumping in mid-air 
to get to hard-to-reach places. Donald can only 
take one hit from an enemy (which puts him in a 
visibly grumpy mood), a second one means losing a 
life and having to start over the level. Goodies 
to be collected include various orbs that gain 
extra lives, restore Donald's health or put him 
into Hyper mode. In this mode, he can simply run 
over enemies to defeat them and also break down 
barriers to get to new locations.

Disney's The Emperor's New Groove for the Game Boy 
Color is a 2D platform game based on the Disney 
movie of the same name. Like in the movie a

cynical llama in his search for a cure for his 
curse. 
 
Each level is a series of platforms and the llama 
can walk around, duck and jump to navigate. He can 
charge and perform head butts to attack opponents. 
He can also spit as a ranged attack but requires 
spit drops for that which he must collect. The 
player has a number of hit-points but can collect 
hearts to replenish them. 
 
Puzzles include locked doors, switches and 
barriers, which mostly have to be solved using 
your spit or charge action in the right places.

DK and Diddy Kong have left in search of The Lost

baby cousin Kiddy Kong.  Frustrated at this, she 
decides to take Kiddy with her and find The Lost 
World before everyone else! 
 
As with Donkey Kong Country 3: Dixie Kong's Double 
Trouble!, Dixie Kong takes the lead in the third 
chapter of the Donkey Kong Land series. Dixie can 
glide using her hair, and carries barrels over her 
head.  Her partner is the heavy Kiddy, who carries 
barrels in front of him, and can jump a bit 
further by somersaulting over platform edges 
first. 
 
There are also special animal friends that can 
help the two primates out.  Ellie the Elephant can 
shoot water at enemies, while Enguarde the 
Swordfish can glide through water with ease. 
Squawks the Parrot can fly and spit eggs, and 
Squitter the Spider can shoot webbing as well as 
use it to create new platforms. 
 
Each level has Bonus Coins and DK Coins tucked 
well away in the levels.  While it's possible to 
gain an ending without these, to complete the game 
properly, players must seek them all out and 
unlock levels of the fabled 'Lost World'.  A new

Dragon Warrior III is the concluding game of the

story takes us back to the time period of the 
legendary Erdrick (also known as Loto), the 
ancestor of the first game's hero. You are the son 
of a powerful warrior Ortega, skillful in physical 
combat and spellcasting. Your father went out to 
fight the evil Baramos, who is responsible for the 
appearance of monsters in your region, and never 
returned. You are sent by the king on a quest to 
continue your father's brave deeds and to defeat 
Baramos. 
 
Dragon Warrior III is a top-down role-playing game 
where you travel around the overworld, caves, 
castles, cities and other locations while battling 
random encounters, buying equipment, and talking 
to people. You and your party members receive 
experience when they beat up monsters and level up 
with enough experience, increasing their stats. 
The game features a day/night cycle - as you 
travel, day slowly changes to night and vice versa

F-1 World Grand Prix II (c) Dec, 2000 Video 
  System Co., Ltd. / Tommo Inc. 
 
F1 World Grand Prix II is a formula one racing 
game for the Game Boy. Unlike the Nintendo 64 
title of the same name, it features the FIA 
license for the '99 season with all drivers, teams 
and tracks that come along with said license. 
Unlike both the Nintendo 64 and Dreamcast version 
the Game Boy Color version is completely in 2D, 
just as its predecessor. Playing modes include: 
exhibition, Grand Prix, time attack, challenge and 
match race. The latter is a two player mode which 
works with a link cable. Like the Nintendo 64 
version the challenge mode allows you to replay 
some critical events in the season. Cars can be 
completely adjusted (tyres, gears, wings, fuel 
load) and comes with variable weather conditions. 
You can change said settings before a race and 
during pit stops.

F.A. Premier League Stars 2001, The (c) Jun 08, 
  2001 Krisalis Software Ltd. / THQ Inc. 
 
The Game Boy Color version of Stars 2001 is very 
loosely based on the PC/Playstation game with the 
same name. Much of what made the original special 
is gone. For example, the whole concept of Star 
Points, which was such an important part of the 
console game has been removed. Left is a football 
game with a quite ordinary style. Due to the 
Premier League license all twenty teams are real 
and have real world players (16 in each team). The 
gameplay resembles the style of many classic games 
in the genre and is viewed from an top down 
perspective. Play modes available are friendly 
match, full season or a custom league of the 
players' choice.

Your task in this arcade conversion is to guide a

safety at the top of the screen. Both these 
sections are fraught with a variety of hazards, 
each of which will kill the frog and cost you a 
life if contact is made. 
 
The road is full of cars and trucks, at variable 
speeds. The river water itself is fatal, as are 
the snakes which hover within on later levels. 
Frogger must use the arrangement of logs, turtles 
(which are only there for a short time) and 
alligators (but stay away form their faces), and 
then jump into one of the open home-cells, ideally 
one containing a fly for extra points. Once all 
holes have been filled, you move onto the next, 
harder, level.

Ganbare Goemon - Hoshizorashi Dynamites Arawaru!! 
(c) 2000 Konami Co., Ltd. / Konami Co., Ltd. 
 
Hoshizorashi Dynamites Arawaru!! marks another 
platformer entry in the Ganbare Goemon series. 
Forgoing RPG touches, the game returns to the 
action / platformer roots of the 16-bit titles by 
casting you as Goemon and his pal Ebisumaru as 
they traverse several levels based on a bizarre 
version of feudal Japan in hopes of defeating the 
forces of an evil alien invader. 
 
The Game alternates between stages featuring 
either Goemon or Ebisumaru. Each character takes a 
different route towards the bad guy and as a 
result the stages scroll differently for each 
character. You can collect upgraded items and 
weapons but there's no character upgrading besides 
that. The game also features mid-level bonus 
rounds featuring the rest of Goemon's buddies in 
several arcade mini-games as traditional for the 
series.

Ganbare Goemon - Mononoke Douchuu Tobisuise 
Nabebugyou! (c) 1999 Konami Co., Ltd. / Konami 
Co., Ltd. 
 
Another RPG title for the Ganbare Goemon series. 
Once again you take control of the wily adventurer 
Goemon and his buddies as they travel through 
feudal Japan fighting evil in its wackiest 
incarnations. This time around an evil warlord 
seems to have taken control of Edo castle and used 
the place to flood all of Japan with strange 
demons. 
 
The gameplay is similar to the other RPGs in the 
series, in which you control your party from an 
overhead map and explore each area getting quests 
and items in order to advance the main plot. While 
you control a party, combat is strictly 
one-on-one, as the game attempts to join the 
Pokémon craze with "dueling" combat between 
individual monsters. Additionally, you can capture 
and train the monsters you defeat, and even 
upgrade them or merge them with other creatures to 
obtain additional powers. The game can also 
connect with the similarly-themed Mononoke 
Sugoroku for the N64, in order to transfer and 
exchange monsters between both titles.

A unique entry in the Ganbare Goemon series, 
Tengu-to no Gyuakushu! doesn't place you in the 
shoes of the wily Goemon and his gang of 
crime-fighting buddies but instead casts you as a 
small kid from modern Japan that gets magically 
whisked away to Goemon's feudal Japan. You'll get 
to meet Goemon and co. in the flesh and as luck 
would have it, a unique threat looms over both 
eras and only you can save the day. 
 
The game plays as a traditional Japanese RPG in 
which you control a party of up to 3 characters 
from Goemon's gang and explore the game world 
getting quests and advancing the main plot. Combat 
switches you to a turn-based side-view in which 
your selected "lead" character performs the main 
attacks and actions while your other characters 
lend their special abilities in supporting roles.

Grand Theft Auto (c) Nov 22, 1999 Tarantula 
Studios / Take-Two Interactive Software, Inc. 
 
In Grand Theft Auto, the player takes the role of 
a small-time criminal trying to make it big with 
the mob. Stealing cars, doing jobs for the 
gangsters and behaving generally anti-social are 
the way to success. 
 
The action moves through six levels spread over 
three different cities, each based on a real US 
city: Liberty City (based on New York City), San 
Andreas (based on San Francisco) and Vice City 
(based on Miami). To finish a level, a certain 
score must be reached. Stealing cars and crashing 
into traffic, driving over pedestrians and killing 
cops all raise the score, but the 
big points are made through jobs. Answering phones 
or entering special cars brings mission 
assignments, from simple "ditch-a-hot-car" jobs to 
supporting bank robberies or carrying out 
assassinations. Completing a mission will raise 
the score substantially and also increase the 
score multiplier, so that completing the next 
felony will gain even more points. 
 
Criminal behavior comes with a price of course: if 
policemen witness a crime, the player's wanted 
level rises. At the lowest level, a single police 
car might give chase, whereas at the highest level 
whole car squads hunt the player, the police set 
up roadblocks and shoot to kill. The only way to 
evade the cops is to find a respray shop and get a 
new paint job with new license plates. This costs 
money which is deducted from the score, however. 
But even dying or being arrested are not the end. 
The player has several lives, and ending up in 
jail simply results in being stripped of all 
weapons and armor and the score multiplier being 
lowered. 
 
The entire action is viewed from a top-down 
perspective, which zooms out while driving a car, 
for a better overview at high speeds. The cities 
are many screens large and can be freely explored. 
Crates are scattered over the cities, which might 
include weapons (from pistols to rocket 
launchers), armor or other bonus items: extra 
lives, police bribes (used to reduce the wanted 
level to zero) and get-out-of-jail-free cards 
(used to retain score multiplier and weapons when 
busted). Dozens of different vehicles are 
available for the taking, each with unique 
characteristics: a bus will handle very 
differently than a sports car.

Hanasaka Tenshi Tenten-kun no Beat Breaker (c) Apr 
28, 1999 Konami Co., Ltd. / Konami Co., Ltd. 
 
Hanasaka Tenshi Tentenkun no Beat Breaker is a 
hybrid of the game Simon and a match-3 puzzle 
game.  Four buttons are required to play - left 
and right on the Control Pad, and the A and B 
buttons.  The game screen is split in half.  The 
top half contains eight columns, followed by a 
striped line, and then an empty white area.  To 
the left of the game screen is the time bar.  As 
you complete rounds, the bar increases.  When the 
bar reaches the top of the clock, the level is 
complete.  If your white area fills up beyond the 
striped lines, the game is over. 
 
Each round has eight notes played in a specific 
rhythm.  After they are played, they play again, 
and this time, after each note is played, circles 
fall down the columns.  Your goal is to press a 
button when the circles hit the striped line, 
which turns them into colored circles with either 
arrows, A or B on them.  These then land in the 
bin.  If you miss hitting a note, the circles turn 
into black angry face circles, which are more 
difficult to clear.  Perform enough beats 
correctly and happy face circles will appear - 
these act as wildcards. 
 
When three or more colored circles line up 
horizontally, they clear from the screen and 
points are scored.  While you could complete 
levels by simply pressing the same button in time 
over and over, the other buttons can be used to 
set up combos, allowing for bigger points.  In 
addition, if you press a note incorrectly, 
sometimes a different button symbol will fall 
instead, which you must then strategically try to 
clear.

As the young Sebastian, gamers take the role of 
the son of a brilliant scientist who has 
discovered a means to travel through time. Time 
travel has already taken place in this reality, 
however, and Sebatian's first mission is to use 
his father's discovery to return to the past and 
destroy an earlier time machine, which upset the 
balance of power in a past war and led to 
dangerous realities in their present. Just as 
Sebastian enters the machine to travel back to the 
past, he watches helplessly as his father is 
kidnapped and taken prisoner. 
 
You play as Sebastian, the soldier sent back in 
time to rectify the present. Hands of Time 
features an overhead view and six levels, each of 
which is comprised of a small overworld with 
various objectives. Much of the game requires 
completing item-swapping sequences in order to 
progress, while avoiding enemy soldiers along the 
way. You have a small pistol with infinite ammo. 
You can collect better weapons, though their ammo 
is limited. There are no difficulty levels and no 
multiplayer

Harry Potter and the Chamber of Secrets (c) Nov 
15, 2002 Griptonite Games / Electronic Arts, Inc. 
 
The second Harry Potter role-playing game follows 
directly on from the first, with mostly the same 
game mechanics, controls and even some of the 
graphics. 
 
To unravel the mystery of the Chamber of Secrets, 
young wizard Harry Potter must fight turn-based 
battles and solve quests. In this game, he is not 
alone, as a party system was added: his friends 
Ron and Hermione (and some other characters) will 
join Harry in the battles. While Harry (as in the 
previous game) can use card combinations of Famous 
Witches and Wizards cards to produce special 
attacks and effects, his friends have other means: 
Ron can unleash his rat Scabbers in special rat 
attacks and Hermione, being the know-it-all that 
she is, influences combat through "lecture 
attacks", using helpful hints like "Be Careful!" 
(which increases defense, for example). 
 
Gone is the potion-mixing from the first game, but 
aside from the party system, several other 
features were added: the Informous spell divulges 
information about strengths and weaknesses of 
enemies, which is stored and can be accessed 
later. To aid in finding one's way around 
Hogwarts, floor maps were added. 
 
Like the first game, this one also includes 
several mini-games, including Quidditch, that once 
found in the game can be accessed from the main 
menu.

Harry Potter and the Sorcerer's Stone (c) Nov 16, 
2001 Griptonite Games / Electronic Arts, Inc. 
 
In the first Harry Potter game for the Game Boy 
Color, the story of Harry's first year at Hogwarts 
School of Witchcraft and Wizardry is told in the 
form of a traditional role-playing game. 
 
Playing as Harry, one advances through the plot of 
the book and the movie by fulfilling quests, 
battling monsters and gaining experience and 
levels. 
 
Combat is turn-based, with Harry being able to use 
a variety of spells against various critters and 
other enemies. In addition, card combinations of 
Famous Witches and Wizards Collector's Cards can 
be used to produce powerful magical effects. These 
cards can be found all over the freely explorable 
Hogwarts. Potions that refill stamina and magic 
points can be found, bought or mixed by Harry 
himself, but only with the right ingredients. 
 
As in other Potter games, Harry also competes for 
house points for Gryffindor, hoping to win the 
House Cup in the end. 
 
The game features several mini-games that, once 
found in the main game, can also be accessed from 
the main menu.

After much acclaim for your past farming 
accomplishments (as part of the previous Harvest 
Moon titles on GBC), you are asked by a young girl 
to help her get her farm up and running. The farm, 
situated on an island, needs plenty of work, so 
you need all your skills to get things working 
correctly. 
 
Your many tasks range from tending to the farm 
animals, keeping an eye on the budget while 
purchasing goods (food, water, mechanical items, 
etc) at the local stores, and so forth. And 
although the main aim is to build and maintain the 
farm, there are plenty of opportunities to take 
care of yourself (go to the movies, buy pets, find 
a girlfriend/boyfriend).

Software, Inc. / Natsume, Inc. 
 
Harvest Moon is a farming simulator/RPG where you 
must build and maintain a farm during the course 
of a year, while taking care of your budget and 
yourself. 
 
You have the ability to buy, sell and take care of 
farm animals, crops and any other supplies that 
you may have. You can trade with many of the 
town's people, and fellow farmers. If you link up 
a friend's Game Boy, you can trade items between 
players as well. 
 
The local stores supply plenty of items to help 
you in your quest, at a cost, of course. And if 
you have the time, you can go about the town in 
search of a little fun away from work. 
 
From an overhead perspective, you can explore your 
farming area, the local town and the Harvest 
Sprite tunnels, full of strange and wonderful 
creatures that can help or destroy your quest. 
There are four seasons (Summer, Autumn, Winter, 
Spring) and each brings with it new challenges 
such as keeping arm animals warm during the colder 
seasons, and supplying water to the crops during 
the warmer periods. 
 
The GBC version includes all new characters and 
background sprites in full color, but is also 
backwards compatible with the original Game Boy 
version.

Go Go Gadget!!!  Once again the evil Dr. Claw has 
brought misery onto the world by unleashing a 
horrible new virus called the Madkactus virus and 
it is up to Inspector Gadget, his niece Penny and 
her dog Brain to stop Dr. Claw and save the world 
yet again. 
 
The gameplay is a side-scrolling action game as 
the player takes control of Inspector Gadget, 
Penny and Brain in five different levels, each 
with four different areas to explore.  The player 
will experience enemies and traps along the way 
and can use famous devices such as the hammer hat, 
spring arms and rocket shoes to either elude or 
eliminate enemies or avoid deadly traps. 
 
Along the way, however, Gadget will have to rely 
on Penny and Brain to reach areas that are 
inaccessible to him.  Both are weaker in 
attacking, but are faster and can be used to 
transverse past traps and deactivate them to let 
Gadget past or solve puzzles in mini-game form in 
order to advance to the next area. 
 
Additionally, players can find power-ups such as 
muffins which will restore health and GG symbols, 
obtaining 20 of these symbols will give an extra 
life.  Also MAD symbols will give Gadget three 
extra lives.  Gadget can also pick up weapon items 
such as plungers, which can pick off enemies from 
a long distance or nets which can instantly kill 
any enemies that it comes in contact with.

International Superstar Soccer 99 is a soccer game 
for the Game Boy Color. You can play a 1 player 
match, 2 players match or play an international 
cup. The game doesn't feature an official license

resemble real player names. There are 32 national 
teams to play with. 
 
When you are in the defense you can make a sliding 
and switch players. While in offense you can make 
a pass or a shot. While the ball is in the air it 
is possible to make a header or bicycle kick. 
 
The game is displayed from the side of the field, 
except during penalties, when the camera is aimed 
directly at the goal.

Jeremy McGrath Supercross 2000 (c) 2000 M4 Ltd. / 
Acclaim Entertainment, Inc. 
 
This to-go version of Jeremy McGrath Supercross 
2000 is a top-down racing game, featuring two game 
modes (championship and arcade), 6 bikers and a 
variety of tracks in different scenarios. 
 
Season mode features 3 championships, each with 
three stages composed of four races. The goal is 
to win all 9 gold medals by obtaining more points 
than the competition. Arcade mode is the same, 
except all championships and stages, as well as 
Jeremy McGrath, are unlocked from the start. 
The difference between championships is the engine 
size - with larger (thus faster) bikes, the player 
has less time to react, and going head to head 
into the edge of the track can be a matter of a 
simple bump in 80cc to a spectacular flip into the 
stands in 250cc, also because it becomes a lot 
harder to do sharp turns in a limited space. 
 
While it can be played as a straightforward racing 
game, by performing tricks the player can obtain 
some powerups - a bomb will knock down the next 
opponent, the arrow temporarily boosts bike stats 
and the shield allows the player to barge into one 
opponent, knocking him off his bike. There is one 
big catch - the skull and bones knock the player 
out of his bike, which can prove to be decisive in 
a close race.

This unique RPG provides a world of fishing as the

The Fish: As a young boy, you must search out the 
fish called Guardian, the only fish in the river 
that can cure a disease caught by your sister, 
Teruyo. This mode combines RPG elements such as 
buying items, talking to the town's folk and 
searching the local river for the Guardian fish. 
The fishing element comes into play when you bait 
or lure fish at the river, in hopes to find a 
fish. 
 
Raise mode allows you to purchase a fish tank and 
the extras, and raise a small fish. Much like the 
many Pokémon type games, you can feed it, keep the 
tank clean and raise the fish.

Lemmings (c) Dec 20, 2000 Tarantula Studios / 
Take-Two Interactive Software, Inc. 
 
Your task is to rescue the Lemmings across 120 
levels of fast-paced puzzling. These creatures 
simply walk blindly through the world in the hope 
of reaching safety at the end of the level - 
unfortunately these levels include steep drops, 
gaps in the ground, barriers and rivers amongst 
other hazards. 
 
You are in control not of any individual Lemming, 
but of a cross-hair, which can be moved over any 
of the Lemmings. Along the bottom are a selection 
of functions which can be assigned to a Lemming, 
including climbing, floating and bashing. You must 
click to select the appropriate function, then 
click on the Lemming to activate it. Each level 
has a different range of skills on offer, a 
different amount of Lemmings, and a different 
percentage target in order to progress.

Bugs Bunny & Lola Bunny - Carrot Crazy (c) 1998 
Infogrames Europe SA / Infogrames Europe SA 
 
Looney Tunes: Carrot Crazy is a side scrolling 
platform game featuring famous Warner Bros. 
cartoon characters Bugs Bunny and Lola Bunny. 
After finding out all carrots have been stolen 
from their garden, as Bugs or Lola Bunny the 
player will have to investigate. Bugs will have to 
explore the Warner Bros. studio to find out who 
stole the carrots. 
 
Like many platform games you walk from left to 
right through a level. There are five different 
worlds which represent the surroundings of 
characters Yosemite Sam, Marvin the Martian, Daffy 
Duck, Elmer Fudd and the Tasmanian Devil. Each 
world is divided into several levels. The object 
of each level is to find all film clapboards 
present. 
 
Bugs and Lola can jump and hit things with a 
mallet (or rolling pin for Lola). They also both 
feature unique special abilities. Bugs Bunny can 
dig and move heavy chests and Lola can float down 
safely from large heights with her parasol. 
Players can switch between characters at any time. 
 
Power-ups in the game include carrots for energy 
required for special abilities, a super carrot 
that allows the player to fly like a helicopter 
(using his ears) and the habanero carrot, which 
makes the player invincible for a while. 
 
If you collect the letters EXTRA during the level 
you get to play a small minigame where you have to 
shoot firecrackers at moving targets. 
 
Each of the worlds ends with a showdown with the 
major character of that world. Usually this 
involves running from a vehicle that pursues the 
player, while avoiding obstacles.

Infogrames Lyon / Infogrames North America 
 
Looney Tunes Collector: Alert! is an action game 
for the Game Boy Color. You play as Bugs Bunny who 
has to prevent Marvin the Martian from destroying 
the world. Marvin's companion K-9 has accidentally 
thrown out his teleportation device, which has 
broken into multiple pieces. It's up to Bugs to 
find these pieces before Marvin does. To do so 
he'll need the help of all his looney friends who 
all have their own special abilities. There are 47 
characters to be found in the game, of which 14 
are playable characters. 
 
In adventure mode you play 12 missions with as an 
ultimate goal saving the world. You can also play 
competitive games in two-player mode. There are an 
additional 8 secret missions you can unlock when 
you trade characters using these mini-games. 
Different cartridges of the game contain different 
characters, and while you can finish the adventure 
mode with the given characters, unlocking the 
secret missions requires you to trade characters 
with friends. 
 
As Bugs Bunny you can walk, jump, swim, search and 
attack enemies.  You can collect carrots for 
health, maps to guide you, coins for points, 
ammunition for Elmer Fudd's rifle, dynamite, 
treasure chests, keys, radar, etc. Some items are 
required to complete certain missions.

Looney Tunes: Marvin Strikes Back! is the sequel 
to Looney Tunes Collector: Alert!. This time you 
play as Marvin the Martian. After his defeat in 
the previous game he sees a video from Daffy Duck 
claiming he was the one who defeated Marvin. This 
ticks Marvin off and he goes back to Earth again 
to take revenge on Daffy. 
 
Marvin can only walk and shoot, so he has to rely 
much more on the other characters to help him (for 
example to fit through small holes or jump over 
pits). This time there are 45 Looney Tunes 
characters to collect and play with. These can 
again be traded and won in two-player mode. The 
game is compatible with the previous game, so you 
can bring characters from the first into the 
second game.

Lucky Luke (c) May, 1999 Infogrames Europe SA / 
Infogrames Europe SA 
 
You play as Lucky Luke, lonesome cowboy, who draws 
his gun faster than his shadow.  In a received 
telegram you read that Jesse James, Billy the Kid, 
Pat Poker, and The Dalton Brothers have escaped 
from jail. You as a good cowboy and law keeper 
have to catch them and return them back, finishing 
12 levels of the game. 
 
Players guide Luke through levels by walking, 
jumping, climbing and ducking.  There are also 
objects to collect such as dynamite (which can be 
used to reveal hidden paths), revolver barrels, 
sheriff stars and other useful items.  You also 
have to use collected items to get past a certain 
obstacle, such as to show a red cloth to a bull, 
feed a dog with a bone, and so on. Luke can attack 
enemies by shooting in straight or diagonal 
directions.  Shooting exhausts the six bullets in 
your gun's barrel. To kill the bandits, bad 
Indians, prisoners, you should shoot at them for a 
certain number of times. 
 
Locations of the levels vary from towns, saloons, 
and jails, to the prairies, ranches, and Indian 
village in Cheyenne Mountains. At the end of most 
levels you have to challenge one of the bosses, 
and at the end of the final level you should 
challenge four Daltons one after another again. 
 
Some levels are scrolling arcades such as 
stagecoach traveling, chasing a train, escaping 
the Tornado or Buffalo, or flowing in the rapids. 
Also the bonus level is present, where you should 
shoot all the bottles to get and extra life.

The third title of the Lufia series gives us an 
entirely new battle and dungeon system. All of the 
dungeons in this game are randomly generated, 
which can get annoying at times. Otherwise, it's a 
lot like Lufia 2 in the dungeon department. You 
see the monsters, they move when you move and you 
can stun them. 
 
The battle system in this game is rather unique. 
You can use 9 characters in a 3x3 formation. The 
character in the front row deals the most physical 
damage, but also takes the most physical damage. 
Vice versa for the back row one, and the one in 
the middle row obviously takes and deals average 
damage. 9 characters might seem like much to use, 
but you can only let 3 characters attack during a 
turn

The battle sequences are a blend of Pokémon and 
Yu-Gi-Oh!.  The player battles enemies using a 
turn-based card system with captured monsters from 
previous fights and can use certain relics 
scattered throughout the world to combine with 
their monster/card to help them defeat enemies and 
advance.  However there are only a certain amount 
of relics so the player must use careful strategy 
when using them in battle.

Mario Golf on Game Boy Color isn't a straight port 
of the N64 game - it's a totally different game in 
its own right. It is a combination of a golf game 
and an RPG. As in an RPG, you choose your 
character at the beginning, with various strengths 
and weaknesses, and throughout the course of the 
game, your character gains experience points 
through winning matches or playing mini-games. 
Experience points can be distributed to various 
skills, such as putting, which makes it easier for 
you to do well. There are quite a few skills, and 
no two characters you can create will play in 
exactly the same way. 
 
Although the story mode is the main part of the 
game, there's quite a few other modes to keep you 
busy, like Tournament, Match Game, Stroke, 
Training, and the two-player mode via link cable. 
It comes with a dictionary of all the golf terms 
you'll need, and an extensive range of statistics 
on your player.

version, the GBC version features an RPG-style 
world that allows you to work your way up through

The main mode, Mario Tour, has you starting off as 
a Rookie with low stats. By completing training 
programs and defeating other students, you're able 
to gain experience points, which allow you to 
boost your tennis stats. When you're not playing 
tennis, you can spend time wandering the Academy 
grounds: talking to other students, or just taking 
in the sights and sounds. 
 
In addition to the main game, there's also an 
exhibition mode (singles or doubles) for 
quick-play. And, if you get tired of playing the 
computer, the game supports the Game Link Cable 
for play against a friend.

Each level has you switching control between three 
characters: Mary-Kate, Ashley, and their dog, 
Clue.  Each character has different abilities.  
Ashley can flip switches to open doors and the 
cage in which the puzzle piece is hidden.  She can 
also pick Clue up and throw him.  Clue can be 
thrown and he can swim.  Other characters can 
stand on him to get a bit of a boost to their 
jumps as well.  Mary-Kate serves as a trampoline 
of sorts.  The other characters can bounce on her 
head for a big jump boost.  She can also jump the 
highest of the three. 
 
In each level, you must use the special abilities 
of all characters to remove obstacles,open the 
cage that contains the puzzle piece and reach 
piece.  There are five mysteries in all, each with 
eleven stages, for a total of fifty-five levels of 
puzzle-solving.

Metal Gear Solid (c) Apr 24, 2000 Konami Computer 
Entertainment Japan, Inc. / Konami of America, 
Inc. 
 
Metal Gear Solid (original Japanese name: Metal 
Gear: Ghost Babel) for GameBoy Color is not the 
same game as the popular Playstation/PC 
installment of the series. It is not set within 
the storyline of Metal Gear series, but instead 
tells an unrelated episode featuring the same hero 
- special agent Solid Snake. A secret government 
project, codenamed "Babel", attempts to revive the 
Metal Gear project - development of a highly 
destructive mech weapon. But an organization known 
as Gindran Liberation Front hijacked the Metal 
Gear prototype, without which any further 
development would be useless. Solid Snake is sent 
to infiltrate Outer Heaven, a location not 
entirely unfamiliar to him, and to retrieve the 
prototype. 
 
The game is similar in style and gameplay to early 
Metal Gear games. It is viewed from top-down 
perspective, and its gameplay is mostly based on 
stealth. Snake has to sneak past the guards, using 
various tactics to distract them or to kill them 
silently. Weapons, gadgets, and moves are all 
similar to those used in the other Metal Gear 
Solid game. From time to time Snake will also 
encounter bosses whom he will have to defeat in 
order to proceed to the next area. Virtual 
Missions for Snake are also included in this 
release.

Metal Walker (c) Feb, 2001 Capcom Co., Ltd. / 
Capcom Entertainment, Inc. 
 
Metal Walker is a mechanical take on Pokémon, 
where the story takes place in the future on an 
island where a mysterious element called core has 
been discovered.  This "core" element was used to 
create a highly advanced race of robots called 
Metal Walkers that are used for both labor and 
protection for the people of the island.  One day, 
however, a gang of robots decide to rebel and end 
up killing a very prominent member of the island.  
The player then takes control of the son, Tetsuo, 
with the help of Dr. Hawk and Tetsuo's Metal 
Walker in an attempt to hunt down the rebel robots 
and avenge his father's death. 
 
The gameplay is very similar to Pokémon, where the 
player explores various areas of the island 
searching for clues called Data Packets and 
battling other Metal Walkers or wild Walkers 
called Metal Busters, but instead of capturing 
these walkers, the player instead destroys them.  
Destroying these other Walkers results both in 
scrap metal and items called Capsules that can be 
used to upgrade or "evolve" Tetsuo's Walker into a 
more advanced form.  Additionally, the player can 
take the scrap metal to the Junk Shop where they 
can also be turned into capsules as well.  
Additionally, capsules can not only contain 
power-ups, but traps as well that can be used in 
battles. 
 
The battles are also different, whereas this one 
the attacks consists of rolling attacks that are 
angled off of the walls of arenas.  Additionally, 
if a player fights multiple opponents, all of the 
enemies will be present on the screen at one time 
and if they choose the right attack and angle, can 
result in multiple hits on multiple opponents. 
 
There are also three types of Walkers: Land, 
Marine, and Sky where, just like in Pokémon, 
susceptible to the other (ex. Land walkers have 
advantages over Marine walkers but are vulnerable 
and weaker to Sky Walker attacks).  Base camps can 
also be built around various areas of the island 
and can be used for restoring the health of the 
players Walker. 
 
As the player progresses farther into the game, 
they will encounter over 100 different Walkers, 
each with their own strengths and weaknesses as 
well as bosses that have to be defeated in order 
to access more areas of the island.  Players can 
also use the Link Cable to both battle their Metal 
Walkers or even exchange their base camps.

Mickey's Racing Adventure (c) Nov, 1999 Rareware / 
Nintendo of America Inc. 
 
Everyone in Mickey's home town was getting 
prepared for a big carnival!  Professor Ludwig Von 
Drake had just finished all the carnival floats 
and was showing them to Mickey, Minnie, and all 
their friends.  However, spying from his creepy 
mansion on the outskirts of town was Big Bad Pete, 
furious at the group enjoying themselves.  Soon, 
he'd gathered his cronies and raced into town, 
swiping all the floats and decorations.  All that 
was left was a letter challenging them to a race 
to get their things back. 
 
Mickey's Racing Adventure is an adventure game 
that centers around isometric racing challenges in 
various worlds.  It's possible to play as Mickey 
and his friends, as they explore various parts of 
Mickey's town, earning money for car upgrades and 
finding train tokens to travel to different worlds 
and challenge Pete and his henchmen to various 
races.  For a fee, Magica de Spell will also 
conjure up spells for you to use in races and get 
an edge on your opponents. 
 
The first time you travel to a new world via the 
train, Casey Jr., you must play a special train 
mini-game.  Pete has muddled the tracks leading to 
the worlds, and you must guide Casey Jr. by 
shifting the track tiles around so that he doesn't 
hit any dead-ends.  There are also TNT detonators 
that you must set off by running into them before 
you can guide Casey Jr. to the exit. 
 
The game also allows you to play as Pluto - while 
he can't race himself, he can sniff around town 
and dig for secrets.  He'll also find hidden 
tunnels which let you play a Digger-like mini-game 
where you must either collect all the bones 
underground, or defeat the other dogs in the area 
by dropping rocks on them.  After completing the 
objective, Pluto must then head to the exit. 
 
Mickey's Racing Adventure also supports the Game 
Boy Color's Infra-Red feature by allowing you to 
send e-mail to your friends via the Infrared 
Communications port.  Once you unlock the Print 
Shop, you can also use the Game Boy Printer to 
print out assorted Disney stickers.

Mickey's Speedway USA (c) Mar 26, 2001 Rareware / 
Nintendo of America Inc. 
 
The Weasels have kidnapped Mickey Mouse's dog!  
All that was left was a ransom note with a picture 
of Pluto being hauled away in a van, and some 
scrawled writing taunting Mickey to try and catch 
them.  Not knowing what else to do, Mickey called 
up his friends, who all volunteered to help - even 
Big Bad Pete plans to race!  You'll have to speed 
across the country to catch up with the weasels 
and rescue Pluto! 
 
Mickey's Speedway USA is an isometric racing game 
that uses the same engine as Mickey's Racing 
Adventure.  Players can choose from Mickey, 
Minnie, Donald, Daisy, Goofy or Pete (and some 
secret characters too) as they race around various 
famous cities and landmarks from the United 
States, including Los Angeles, the Grand Canyon, 
San Francisco, Montana, and Yellowstone, just to 
name a few. 
 
The Adventure Mode of the game plays out Grand 
Prix style.  You must complete four races in each 
world, and at the end of each race, you're given 
points based on your placing.  The player with the 
most points at the end of the four races wins the 
trophy for that circuit.  There are assorted 
power-ups that help you as you race, including the 
Baseball Chucker (a projectile), the Magno Flyer 
(a homing missile), the Carbo Spritzer (a turbo), 
and the Paint Splotcher (an oil slick). 
 
There is also a Time Trial mode which lets you 
race any track that you've previously unlocked - 
while you can use it to practice tracks, the goal 
is to race fast enough to beat the track's lap 
time and earn a gold star in every race.  Another 
mode is Professor Von Drake's 'Driving School'.  
In this mode, you must complete specific tasks 
given to you, such as parking, reverse parking and 
slalom driving.  The faster you perform these 
tasks, the better ranking you will receive (again, 
with a gold star as your ultimate goal).  However, 
you will receive a time penalty if you hit a cone 
or wall, or miss your parking spot, so accuracy 
counts as well. 
 
Mickey's Speedway USA supports many of the Game 
Boy Color's functions - you can play a two-player 
link cable race, transfer data from Mickey's 
Racing Adventure via the IR Link to unlock a 
secret, and connect to the Nintendo 64 version of 
Mickey's Speedway USA using the Transfer Pak.  As 
you progress through the game, you'll unlock many 
postcards and pictures for your album, which can 
be printed out via the Game Boy Printer.

Micro Maniacs Racing is a racing game in the Micro

to race cars, boats or any other type of vehicle, 
but micro men. Most courses are on foot, but 
others allow you to take small vehicles such as 
jet skis and skate boards. 
 
The game offers a variety of micro men to play 
with, ranging from mutants, cyborgs, mad 
professors, experiments gone wrong, and other 
strange characters. They all have their own 
special weapon to give them an edge in the races. 
There are 32 races which are organised by a mad 
doctor who hopes to find the ultimate soldier 
among these micro maniacs. 
 
The Game Boy Color version is completely in 2D. In 
good Micro Machines tradition, the races are all 
held in and around the house, including the 
garage, living room, bathroom, study and deck.

Microsoft Puzzle Collection (c) Oct 24, 2000 
Conspiracy Entertainment  Corp. / Classified Games 
 
6 Puzzle Games designed by Alexey Pajitnov, the 
original Tetris designer, on one Gameboy Color 
cartdridge. 
 
Jewel Chase. A level based game. Every level 
consists of a labyrinth of colored pathways, 
scattered valuables, locked doors, keys, a thief 
(the player), on some levels an opposing thief and 
a door marked exit. The goal is to reach the exit 
to proceed to the next level, valuables can be 
'stolen' for score. If the opposing (computer 
controlled) thief reaches the exit before the 
player, the game is lost. Movement is not possible 
between differently colored tiles, unless a 
special, multicolor 'bridge' stone is used. 99 
levels total. 
 
Spring weekend. A rotation puzzle, where a given 
pattern needs to be recreated by rotating elements 
on the playfield. 
 
Lineup. Using 'Tetris' style blocks, a continuous 
line from a screen border to an opposite screen 
border needs to be build. Elements appear on an 
element stack, and can be selected freely from 
that and subsequently placed anywhere on screen, 
without overlapping each other. If the element 
stack is full, the game is over. As soon as a line 
is complete, the elements of that line are removed 
from the screen. Elements appear faster over time. 
 
Finty Flush. A grid on top of the screen fills 
slowly with multicolor balls. The player can pick 
one out of 4 squares on the bottom of the screen 
to shift balls in one line into and out of these 
squares. The squares can be rotated in 90 degree 
steps. As soon as any square is completely full 
with balls of the same color, its content empties 
to make room for more balls. 3 filled square grids 
grant a bonus point, and the next level begins 
(tiles appear faster). The game is over when the 
upper grid is full. 
 
Color Collison. A 'Qix' style ray ( no better way 
to describe this - for the younger audience - 
imagine a flapping fan ) moves with increasing 
speed through a screen full of obstacles. The 
player can only indirectly control it - any time 
the direction pad is pressed, it gets 'reflected' 
into the direction that has been indicated. 
Objective is to hit obstacles with a given color 
and pattern, avoiding all other elements. To top 
things of, the patterns change over time. 
The game ends if the wrong obstacles have been hit 
too many times. 
 
Rat Poker. Little differently colored rats are 
automatically fed into labyrinths, with labyrinth 
design changing and getting more complex during 
level progression. Switches allow rerouting of the 
rats to arrange certain color combinations 
('hands') of rats. If a given combination is 
achieved, the contributing rats exit the playfield 
through a door. You progress to the next level if 
a given number of rats has been removed from the 
game. The game ends if there is no space left on 
the playfield for additional rats.

Monster Rancher Explorer (c) Oct 28, 2000 Graphic 
Research Co., Ltd. / Tecmo, Ltd. 
 
Monster Rancher Explorer is an updated port of 
Tecmo's 1987 NES game, Solomon's Key and features 
environments, characters and monsters from the 
Monster Rancher series of games. The game is a 
platformer with action elements. Each level 
requires a puzzle to be solved within a time 
limit, giving the successful player a key to 
unlock the next level. Bad monsters will attack on 
most levels, so in addition to moving blocks to 
get to the key on each level, a player needs to 
dispatch bad monsters before being killed by them. 
There are good monsters to meet, several hidden 
bonus levels, bonus items, and treasure to be 
found.

Based on the 2001 movie starring Brendan Frasier 
and Rachel Weisz, this version differs greatly 
from it's console version.  The main bulk of the 
game is side-scroller with stages where the player 
moves from right to left trying to escape a wall 
of water while avoiding enemies and pitfalls and 
even a scene recreating the valley escape in the 
blimp, but with the same elements.  There are also 
one-on-one sword fighting stages where the player 
uses a sword to hack away at enemies that appear 
one at a time and even a first-person shooting 
stage that resembles Lethal Enforcers. 
 
There are three different characters to choose 
from, Rick O'Connel, Evelyn O'Connel and Ardeth 
Bay that they can choose at the beginning of each 
stage, each with their own strengths and 
weaknesses and depending on which character they 
pick will determine which stage layout will be 
present (ex. Rick & Evelyn's water escape stage 
feature different traps and enemies they must 
avoid). 
 
There are eleven stages total and a password 
feature that allows players to pick up and play at 
their leisure.

Nicktoons Racing for the Game Boy Color is

It's a kart racing game but on the handheld it is

most famous Nickelodeon characters are competing 
on the race track and the player can choose to 
play as any of them. 
 
Two game modes exist: quick race and championship. 
In the quick race mode players can choose to play 
any track of the four available program 
environments. In the championship the player has 
to complete each track in a specific order. 
 
The game allows the player to race as the 
following seven Nickelodeon characters: 
 
1. Tommy 
2. Eliza 
3. CatDog 
4. Arnold 
5. SpongeBob SquarePants 
6. Dagget 
7. Norbert 
 
Tracks are divided into four different program 
environments: Angry Beavers, The Wild Thornberrys, 
SpongeBob SquarePants and Rugrats. There's 
numerous power ups that the player can pick up. 
For example: Checkered Flag will increase the 
car's top speed, wrapped package gives the player 
a free lap, stop sign will stop the opponents for 
a short time and the milk bottle causes the 
opponents to lose traction.

O'Leary Manager 2000 (c) Sep 15, 2000 LiveMedia UK 
/ Ubi Soft Entertainment Software 
 
In 2000 Ubi Soft released two David 
O'Leary-licensed games. One, David O'Leary's Total 
Soccer 2000,  based on the PC game with the same 
name. The other one was a manager game, O'Leary 
Manager 2000. 
 
The gameplay in O'Leary Manager 2000 is not only 
about the management aspects of football. It's a 
bit similar to Sensible World of Soccer, as you 
can play not only as the manager but also the 
player. This rendered using an top-down view 
similar to many Amiga games from the early 
nineties. 
 
In total there is 240 licensed teams from the top 
two divisions in six European countries. As the 
manager you get to lay up training schedules, buy 
and sell players, pick the right players for the 
right tactics, and a lot of statistics. The game 
handles matches in three different ways, playing 
them, watching them or a text-based interface 
similar to Championship Manager, but with 
highlights shown in the top-down view. If you 
don't want to play through the whole season, you 
can play single matches against the AI or another 
player. The manager mode also supports multiple 
players.

Perfect Dark (c) Aug, 2000 Rareware / Rareware 
 
Joanna Dark is about to become a full-fledged 
agent of the Carrington Institute.  Before she 
does, though, she has one final field test to 
complete - an actual mission in the depths of the 
South American jungle.  Joanna must infiltrate a 
hidden cyborg manufacturing facility.  Along the 
way, she will have her first encounter with the 
nefarious dataDyne corporation. 
 
Perfect Dark is a prequel to the Nintendo 64 game

Joanna Dark, just before her induction into the 
Carrington Institute.  The game plays from a 
top-down perspective, and you battle enemies with 
a variety of high-tech weaponry, from handguns to 
rocket launchers. A weapon can be assigned to the 
A Button and the B Button, which represent your 
left hand and your right hand.  It's also possible 
to search dead enemies for items and ammo by 
pressing Select near their corpse. 
 
Perfect Dark also includes a variety of mini-games 
which you encounter as you progress through the 
story.  There are target ranges to practice in, 
vehicles to drive, sniper rifle sections, which 
are viewed through the sniper scope, and more.  
There are also boss battles against enemy cyborgs, 
helicopters, and other deadly enemies.

Pocket Bomberman (c) Dec 14, 1998 Hudson Soft 
Company, Ltd. / Nintendo of America Inc. 
 
Long, long ago, the sun was covered by a dark and 
heavy cloud. It was said this cloud was caused by 
a monster that had sealed the Sword of the Sun. 
Legends also says that to break the seal, a hero 
must collect five Power Stones that are guarded by 
monsters. Bomberman takes up the challenge as he 
is the last hero strong enough to defeat such 
monsters. 
 
This is a side-scrolling platform game. In each 
world, you must clear four areas by killing any 
monsters within. To kill a monster, you drop a 
bomb. After a few seconds, the bomb explodes in a 
four-way blast. If the monster is within range of 
the blast, it is killed. After you clear these 
four areas, you must clear a fifth area by killing 
a boss to clear the world and collect its Power 
Stone. 
 
Be careful, though, because if Bomberman is 
touched by a monster, touches a dangerous item or 
is caught in the blast of his own bomb, you lose a 
life. After all lives are gone, you get the option 
to restart that last area or quit. In most areas, 
you can, though the placement of bombs, find items 
to increase your jumping, speed, blast radius, 
etc.

Pocket Puyo Sun (c) 1998 Compile / Compile 
 
Another entry in the Puyo Puyo series of arcade 
puzzle games. The evil Dark Prince has caused the 
sun to augment its size and power to dangerous 
levels, and thus the Puyo Puyo world is on the 
verge of being scorched unless you prevent it. 
 
The game features 3 distinct story campaigns, each 
pitting you against a different set of enemies 
which you must battle in classic Puyo Puyo 
fashion: In each stage you face off against an 
opponent in two different play areas, one for you 
and one for your opponent. As the blob-like 
"puyos" start falling in your play area, you must 
align them and create groups of the same color in 
order to clear the screen before you get flooded 
with puyos. Chaining puyos of different colors 
allows you to send several "garbage" puyos to the 
opposing player's play area in hopes of either 
flooding it, or slowing his advance, and whoever 
defeats the opposing player moves on to the next 
challenger. 
 
New for Puyo Puyo Sun are the Sun Puyos, which can 
be added to combos for extra damage. Also includes 
2P vs gameplay, challenge modes and galleries and 
other bonus features.

Puzzled (c) Jun, 2000 Elo Interactive Media GmbH /

Disguised behind a 50's style B-movie background 
story about an evil professor (trying to take over 
the world, of course) who turns the hero (you) 
into a shapeless 'blob', is an increasingly 
complex strategic puzzle game with a variety of 
different targets. Typical Mission goals would be 
centered around clearing the screen of all 
elements, but hitting certain targets on the way 
and making sure that there is still a route to the 
exit. If the player reaches the exit with all 
mission objectives complete, the next level is 
introduced by a password. Playtime per level is up 
to 20 minutes and there are 150 levels. The first 
20 or so levels introduce all game elements one by 
one. 
 
There are various extras, allowing to manipulate 
puzzle pieces, remove blocked routes and so on, as 
well as special blocks such as teleporters 
(beaming you around the playfield), or ice (making 
direction changes impossible) etc. 
 
The basic principle is like memory, i.e. two equal 
looking puzzle pieces need to be found and are 
then taken of the playfield. To do that the player 
can 'clone' the blob, and send his alter ego to 
connect the blocks occupied by the main character 
and the clone.

While technology may improve graphics and sound, 
some things never change. Rampage 2: Universal 
Tour is very much in tune with its history, barely 
deviating from the original city-stomping arcade 
game appearing in the 1980s. Like its predecessor, 
Rampage World Tour, Rampage 2 retains the original 
2D worlds, but improves the graphics, completely 
re-rendering the characters. The premise remains 
the same: stomp out cities and wreck things in 
general. Some new features in Rampage 2 include 
four new characters (in addition to the original 
three), new attacks and combos, a power meter, and 
bonus rounds. The cart allows up to three people 
can play at once and there are plenty of new 
cities to destroy.

Rampage - World Tour (c) Dec, 1998 Game Refuge 
Inc. / Midway Games, Inc. 
 
Rampage World Tour is a updated version of the 
classic Rampage.  Rampage World Tour starts off at 
Scumlabs International where three lab 
technicians, George, Lizzy, and Ralph have mutated 
in an accident involving toxic waste.  George has 
turned into a gigantic ape, Lizzy a gigantic 
lizard or dinosaur, and Ralph some sort of 
gigantic wolf.  The three destroy the lab they 
previously worked at and then embark on a path of 
destruction encompassing the entire globe. 
 
The player chooses one of these three characters 
and begins destroying buildings, eating civilians, 
knocking planes out of the sky, and stepping on 
tanks.  The ultimate goal of the game is to rid 
the world of Scumlabs by traveling to the cities 
where they are located.  Being creatures of such 
massive size, there are many cities that must be 
destroyed along the way.  Scumlabs and the various 
militaries make it a priority to destroy you and 
optionally another player that can play 
simultaneously. 
 
The graphics are worth noting as they are of a 
unique, colorful "cartoon" flavor.  Gameplay 
includes players climb buildings while punching, 
kicking, and eating their inhabitants to destroy 
them.  Once all the buildings for a particular 
stage have been destroyed, the stage is clear and 
players proceed to the next stage.  Players can 
get many different kinds of power-ups that make 
them more powerful or restore health.

Road Rash (c) Nov 05, 2000 3d6 Games, Inc. / 
Electronic Arts, Inc. 
 
Road Rash is an aggressive motorcycle racing game 
where the player assumes the role of a biker who 
takes part in a series of illegal races across the 
U.S.A. Starting at the back of the pack the 
objective is always to finish first on a linear 
course, overtaking the other bikers. This is 
achieved by driving very well or by playing it 
dirty, knocking opponents of their bikes using 
clubs, crowbars or your bare hands. The other 
racers fight back in a similar fashion and there 
are also hazards. All the races take place on the 
regular road with normal traffic (in both 
directions) and the cops, as well as occasional 
oil slicks and stray cows. 
 
By winning races you can get promoted to a 
stronger division and earn cash with which you can 
buy a better bike. Whenever you're knocked off 
your bike or hit something you will have to run 
back to your bike and lose valuable time, plus 
your bike will suffer some damage. When the player 
crashes with cops nearby, it is possible to get 
busted and then you have to forfeit the race. 
 
Like the whole Road Rash lineage, the game has 
arcade-like gameplay with no intention to be a 
motorcycle simulation. While the game has a 
two-player mode, this is not simultaneous.

Sakura Taisen GB - Geki Hana Kumi Nyuutai! (c) Jul 
28, 2000 Red Company Corporation / Media Factory 
 
The first handheld Sakura Taisen game, released 
between the second and the third mainstream ones, 
takes place in the original setting: the Imperial 
Capital in Japan of 1920-ies. It is the Taishou 
era, time of rapid technological development and 
acquaintance with Western life style in Japan. 
Disguised as a group of actresses in the Imperial 
Theater, the Hanagumi Brigade consists of lovely 
ladies who are at the same time skilled fighters, 
able to pilot mechs and to confront the forces of 
evil that threaten Japan. You are a new commander 
of Hanagumi (you can name the hero the way you 
like), who arrives at the theater to work under 
the guidance of Ichirou Oogami, the main hero of 
the series, and to lead the beautiful girls 
Sakura, Sumire, Honglan and others into battle 
against demons. 
 
The game is a mixture of adventure/"dating sim" 
and turn-based battles. The RPG element is also 
present, as the girls fight differently depending 
on how you treat them. Unlike in other Sakura 
Taisen games, the battles here are entirely 
menu-driven. Also, the main plot is unlinear, and 
you can reach one of the 14 available endings, 
which also include "bad" ones. You can even get 
thrown out of the theater for indecent behavior.

The Simpsons: Night of the Living Tree House of 
Horror was released in 2001 as the last in a long

The premise is odd, but fits well with the

house telling scary stories on Halloween night. As 
the night wore on they fell asleep and fell prey 
to the spirits living in Bart's tree house. Now 
each member of the family must fight through his 
or her nightmares to return to reality. 
 
The game re-creates tales from the annual 
Treehouse of Horror Simpsons episodes. Each member 
of the Simpson family has his or her own levels, 
including Marge in a zombie tale, Maggie as a fly, 
Lisa fighting cannibalistic teachers, Bart 
rescuing his dog in a haunted house, and Homer as 
a vampire killer, a robot, and Homer Kong.

Tennis.  The player can initially choose from 
eight characters to play (Snoopy, Charlie Brown,

weaknesses.  By winning against certain opponents

locations unlocked during gameplay.  There are six 
different single player game modes to choose from: 
 
1. Normal, which is a best two-out-of-three 
   game set. 
2. Power, where the player plays a game of 
   tennis with the ability to use power-ups during 
   the match. 
3. Points Win, which the player with the most 
   points within a two minutes wins the match. 
4. Sudden Win, which has no service breaks and 
   the first player with two victories wins the 
   game. 
5. Squash, which is still a normal game of 
   tennis, but adds walls to both sides of the 
   court. 
 
There is also the Championship mode where the 
player takes on several different characters on 
different courts in order to win the Peanuts' 
Tennis Championship and unlock other characters 
under different difficulty settings (easy, medium 
and hard).  There is also a two-player mode using

In 1978, Earth successfully repulsed an invasion 
from outer space thanks to "the Tank."  The Tank 
was based on alien technology found when a scout 
ship had crashed years earlier.  Now, over 20 
years later, a new Tank has been created based on 
the technology recovered during the 1978 invasion. 
 And none too soon, because the Invaders are back! 
 
Space Invaders is yet another classic arcade game 
remake by Activision.  (See Battlezone and 
Asteroids.)  But this time, Activision licensed a 
game from Taito instead of Atari.  The game stays 
close to its roots while adding many power-ups and 
enemies. 
 
You can play either one or two players against the 
Invaders, who march down the screen in orderly 
rows and columns, at one of three skill levels.  
You'll start at Pluto and work your way through 
the Solar System to Mars, then Venus, and finally 
Earth.  There are four common aliens (red, green, 
blue, and yellow), plus seven more less common 
ones.  You receive special one shot power-ups by 
shooting four of the same type of Invaders in a 
row.  As in the original game, there are also 
Mother Ships that fly above the action, but in 
this version if you hit them you can pick up other 
useful power-ups like shields or double shots.  
Plus, after fighting off several waves on each 
planet, you'll face a unique boss.  If you manage 
to finish the game, you'll be able to play a 
reproduction of the original coin-op.

Space Marauder is an scrolling shooter game with

perspective, with a randomized layout. Either way, 
the player is armed with a variety of weapons, 
including different guns (laser, missile, ring) 
and the powerful cobalt bomb which kills 
everything on screen. 
 
Space Marauder is the Game Boy Color version of 
Burai Fighter. Game play is exactly the same. Like 
Burai Fighter it offers the same three 
difficulties (Eagle, Albatross and Ace), but the

Based on the popular Todd McFarlane comic book, 
Spawn sends the titular hero through four stages 
of combat.  He must navigate various environmental 
obstacle while defeating enemies with his fists 
and guns. 
 
Spawn is a platformer with some shooter elements.  
It contains both horizontal and vertical sections. 
 You must make your way through these and defeat 
the various thugs and occasional bosses.  Mostly, 
you'll be punching and kicking, but there are some 
guns with rather limited ammunition to find along 
the way.  There is also one stage where Spawn rids 
a motorcycle, somewhat along the lines of the 
surfing and skating levels in Teenage Mutant Ninja 
Turtles. 
 
There are three difficulty modes.  In each mode, 
enemies can take more damage.  One punch will 
knock out any minor enemy in easy and you can 
start at any stage.  It takes two in normal and 
you must play through from stage one.  On hard, it 
takes several, so the fighting becomes much more 
strategic.  You must beat the game on hard mode to 
get the real ending.

first appearance on the Game Boy Color: an 
explosion at Dr. Curt Conners' lab will lead him 
into a plot planned by a mysterious villain, 
involving the alien symbiote and several of 
Spidey's arch enemies. 
 
The game is a platformer, divided into several 
large levels. Progression is not strictly linear: 
some of the levels can be freely explored in any 
order before continuing with the story. Locations 
include the city, subway and sewers, the docks and 
a warehouse. The levels are usually crawling with 
enemies that Spider-Man can beat up with kicks and 
punches. Defeating them will eventually result in 
him gaining levels, becoming stronger and learning 
some new fighting moves. 
 
Spidey's special abilities come into play when he 
swings freely over the rooftops, clings to walls 
or throws web balls at enemies to immobilize them. 
His spider-sense will usually alert him when 
important locations or special obstacles are near. 
 
The game includes various boss fights with the 
likes of Venom, the Lizard and the Hobgoblin.

Spirou - La Panique Mecanique (c) 2000 Planet 
Interactive Development / Ubi Soft Entertainment 
Software 
 
Spirou: The Robot Invasion is a 2D side'scrolling 
platform game based on the Franco-Belgian comic 
Spirou et Fantasio. 
 
Fantasio bought a strange mechanical device. When 
he brings it home and thoroughly inspects it, it 
turns out to be a malevolent robot who 
subsequently escapes from the house. Soon a 
villain called Cyanide appears to be involved and 
the entire town is crawling with evil robots. It's 
up to the player (as Spirou) to set things 
straight! Armed with a maul you have to trash the 
robots. Controls are similar to other platform 
games: you can walk, jump, attack, use a switch 
and grab a ledge. You'll have to solve simples 
puzzles such as pressing switches to open doors. 
You can pick up items that restore your health or 
unlock bonus levels. The game also has a UBI key 
that allows you to unlock a secret level, and can 
also be used to unlock secrets in other Ubi Soft 
games. 
 
The game is presented in comic strip style much 
like in Comix Zone, where you move from frame to 
frame, each divided by a white border.

It's Street Fighter as you always remember it, 
with some new moves, characters and combo systems, 
as well as a more polished look and feel. 
 
The new moves available for each fighter, called 
Super moves, allow them to fire off very powerful 
moves. A bar at the bottom of the screen 
represents the power that you have to use for the 
moves. You start the first round on 0, and each 
attack that you make adds power to the bar. Once 
you reach level 3, you can unleash the special 
attacks, that can sometimes KO the opponant. 
 
The other major change over the Street Fighter 2 
series are the Alpha counters. These can be used 
to counter an on-coming attack after blocking.

Survival Kids (c) Nov 02, 1999 Konami Computer 
Entertainment Sapporo Co., Ltd / Konami Co., Ltd. 
 
When on a pleasure cruise for his tenth birthday, 
a young boy is swept castaway to a remote island 
by a fierce storm that destroys the entire ship.  
With no family or friends, he must fend for 
himself on this strange, seemingly uninhabited 
island and ultimately find a way to return home. 
 
Survival Kids is presented in an overhead 
action-RPG style similar to Link's Awakening.  
Players must try to survive through each day by 
getting enough rest, eating food and drinking 
water regularly.  This can be risky, as certain 
foods such as mushrooms can have varying effects 
including paralysis and poison, while other foods 
can go rotten and make you sick if you eat it. 
 
The game also features a unique "merge" system, 
which allows you to create a number of different 
items by combining two other items.  For example, 
combining bark and a stick would produce kindling, 
while using ivy with a bent stick could create a 
bow.  There are plenty of useless items that can 
be made in addition to the essentials, so it's up 
to the player to think as to what could be helpful 
in their quest to survive.

defeated with different types of balls that Buster 
has at his disposal (football, soccer and 
baseball), that vary in their behaviour. The 
Baseball travels at slow speeds horizontally and 
explodes if it hits walls. It stuns all enemies 
close to the explosion. The Soccer Balls bounces 
of the floor and is bound by gravity, meaning that 
it will drop of edges etc. The Football travels 
very quickly and diagonally bounces of everything 
for a set amount of time. Soccerball and Football 
'kill' with direct hits. 
 
Progress is tracked via a password feature and the

scrolling in 8 directions. 
 
There are secret rooms to find, and bosses at the 
end of each level. The player can also interact 
with many parts of the background. Using available 
objects such as springs and crates correctly is 
often vital to progress. Alternate modes of

Tom and Jerry - Mouse Hunt (c) 2000 Conspiracy 
Entertainment  Corp. / Conspiracy Entertainment  
Corp. 
 
A chase game. Playing either Tom or Jerry, who 
have slightly different attributes (speed, power, 
size), the player has to fullfil a bunch of tasks 
centered around dozens of little nephew mice, 
invited by Jerry for his birthday and scared of 
into hiding by Tom. While Tom is looking to beef 
up his next meal, Jerry is trying to rescue his 
nephews. Depending on the level, the player has to 
collect a varying amount of mice during a varying 
timeframe. Various extras such as bombs, clubs, 
pans, cheese, a rubber duck and so on help with 
the task. The player has to run around an 8 way 
scrolling level and return the mice to his 
nest/hole (where they could still be bombed, 
counting for the opponent). Extras can be used to 
distract, punch, flatten or otherwise execute the 
opponent, essentially delaying him. 
 
Progress is tracked via a password 
 
The game also offers two mini games, 'Whack-a-cat' 
and a game resembling an old LCD game.

Lara's first venture into the handheld world, has 
her pursuing 'The Nightmare Stone' that holds 
inside a sinister deity. This deity, Quaxet, was 
imprisoned by the combined efforts of the Mayan, 
Aztec and Inca cultures, and now some nasty 
treasure seekers are looking to spoil it all by 
unleashing the evil. Having knowledge of this, 
Lara must set out to prevent the disaster from 
happening by finding the stone first. 
 
This version has the standard Tomb Raider gameplay 
of running, jumping and switch-flipping, but 
presented in a side-view 2D style, reminiscent of 
Flashback. At Lara's disposal are 25 or so moves, 
which are crammed onto the 2 GBC buttons. There 
are also game-save crystals at special points 
throughout the levels.

Tom Clancy's Rainbow Six (c) Apr 03, 2000 Crawfish 
Interactive Ltd. / Red Storm Entertainment, Inc. 
 
The Game Boy Color version of the original Tom 
Clancy's Rainbow Six game scales back the 3D 
visuals of the original game in favor of an almost 
top-down view, but builds on the same premise of 
the player controlling a member of the Rainbow 
counterterrorism unit, responsible for resolving 
hostage situations and neutralizing threats, in 
sixteen missions. 
 
The limitations of the platform are not traded in 
for an arcade-like approach. Just like the major 
computer version it stresses careful planning and 
tactics. After a briefing that needs to be 
followed attentively, the player assumes the role 
of the commander and assembles a squad of eight 
operatives, each with different statistics and 
abilities, based on character traits such as 
aggression and self-control, physical elements 
such as stamina, and specific skills including 
stealth, firearms, electronics, demolitions and 
many other types of weapons. They can be divided 
into up to four independent teams. Next, the 
operatives are outfitted with a selection of six 
different rifles, six different handguns, 24 types 
of armor or camouflage and additional tools 
including heartbeat sensors and door charges. 
Default equipment is suggested right away, but 
that is not sufficient for later missions. In the 
planning mode, the last part of the pre-mission 
activities, the commander needs to set out 
waypoints on the map and determine the course of 
action. 
 
The actual missions are shown in 2D where the 
different characters can sneak around, blow up 
doors, rescue hostages and engage the enemy, all 
requiring a tactical approach. The general plot 
points and mission objectives are true to the 
computer version.

Tonic Trouble for the Game Boy Color is a

go clean things up. Meanwhile badguy Grock is 
taking advantage of the Tonic. 
 
While the story is the same as for the Windows and 
Nintendo 64 version, the gameplay and levels are 
quite different. The Game Boy Color version is 
completely in 2D and plays like a classic 2D 
platform game. Ed can walk and jump and has to 
avoid obstacles such as pits, falling platforms, 
poison spitting holes, and mutated enemies.

This is the first handheld version of Tony Hawk's

It is actually composed of two different events, a

Half pipe mode is viewed from a side perspective, 
kind of like the classic Skate or Die game. You 
perform tricks to achieve a high score. Race mode 
is viewed from a top-down perspective, where you 
goal is to perform tricks and get to the end 
quickly.

Top Gun: Firestorm takes the player to the skies

training missions to receive graduation from the 
Top Gun school. The story is advanced in several 
stills throughout the game. 
 
The player will fly a F-14 Tomcat on an isometric 
map. He has to complete several objectives in each 
mission. To achieve those he has four different 
weapons at his disposal (machine gun, bombs, 
rockets and missiles). The gameplay is somewhat

During a joyride in his biplane, the engine blows 
and Wario crashes into the woods. It's here where 
he finds a hidden cave with a magic Music box. 
Before he can say "I hate Mario", the box pulls 
him inside and into a room with a dark figure, who 
strikes a deal with him. Find all of the missing 
Music boxes and he can leave. And any treasure he 
finds he can keep. 
 
Much like Wario Land 2, Wario can't die from any 
attacks by the enemy. However he can change form 
after certain attacks, which can both help and 
halt his progress in each level. New forms of 
Wario include Invisible Wario and Ball of Yarn 
Wario (an un-controllable ball of yarn, with Wario 
inside). 
 
Also, basic attacks such as swimming and the butt 
stomp don't become available to Wario until after 
completing a certain amount of levels, meaning you 
have to go back to completed levels to access 
other areas full of loot.

Seeking revenge on Wario after he stole their 
treasure in Wario Land: Super Mario Land 3, 
special agents from the Black Sugar Gang of 
Kitchen Island sneak into Wario's newly built 
castle, steal back the treasure, and leave the 
castle and the surrounding area a mess. As Wario, 
you must clean the place up and take back what you 
now call your own. 
 
In a change from the original Wario Land, Wario is 
now immortal, to a certain point. Instead of dying 
when hit by an enemy, Wario loses the coins he 
collected along his travels in each level. And he 
can also turn into other Warios. For example, if 
he is hit by a bee, Wario puffs up into a giant 
ball of air, and floats up to the top of the 
level. Only when hit by a sharp object will he 
return to normal. There are other types, like Fire 
Wario and Zombie Wario, and each can have its 
advantages, like getting to other areas otherwise 
unreachable, or they can halt your progress.

In the perilous world of Warlocked, a ferocious 
war is raging between the Human forces of Queen 
Azarel and the Beast horde of Chief Zog. Players 
can control either side, each of them offers 30 
missions. 
 
Warlocked brings real-time strategy gaming to the 
Boy Color set in a fantasy warfare scenario. The 
key to victory is a balanced mix of resource 
gathering, building, exploration and combat. 
Adding a magical twist to the straightforward 
action is the presence of wizards, each of whom 
has one powerful spell. While some wizards can 
convert enemy troops to your side, others can 
change them into chickens or skeletons. More than 
20 kinds of wizards are hidden throughout the 
game. 
 
Using a Game Link Cable, you can test your war 
skills against another player. Two-player battle 
maps are earned by progressing through the 
single-player game. Warlocked also enables you to 
build your own personal armies with resources that 
you have saved in your campaigns in single player 
mode, and then trade them with a friend using the 
infrared ports on the console.

Wendy - Der Traum von Arizona (c) 2003 BVM 
Produktion GmbH / KIDDINX Entertainment GmbH 
 
"Wendy: Der Traum von Arizona" is an action 
adventure for children of any age. 
 
You play the party of Wendy, a German children's 
cartoon star. She and her friend Bianca are 
dreaming of going on a riding holiday in Arizona. 
To get the money required for it, they have to win 
horse tournaments. 
 
There are seven levels. They are divided into two 
types: There are action-adventure levels where you 
have to accomplish different tasks -- like helping 
your parents or shoeing your horse. To do this, 
you have to speak to different people, find and 
use items at the right location and succeed in 
some mini-games, all the while keeping a safe 
distance from evil animals (like sheep...) which 
hurt you when touched. 
 
Between these action-adventure levels, there are 
the tournament levels in which you perform in 
several different riding disciplines, often with 
some qualification stage before. 
 
At the end of the game, there is another arcade 
sequence in which you have to drive the taxi to 
the airport. If you have done this, you can enjoy 
the ending. 
 
After finishing the game, you can switch to a 
"tournament mode" where you can replay each 
tournament to get as much points as you can.

Wendy - Every Witch Way (c) Sep, 2001 WayForward 
Technologies / TDK Mediactive, Inc. 
 
While exploring her house's attic, the little 
witch Wendy discovers a treasure chest.  Upon 
opening it, magical stones are released from their 
prison, and head to a castle which is suspended in 
the sky. The power of the stones upsets gravity, 
and the castle comes crashing to the ground, right 
on top of Wendy's house!  It's up to Wendy to set 
things right again! 
 
Wendy: Every Witch Way is a combination of a 
side-scrolling platformer and a puzzle game.  As 
Wendy, players explore the castle in search of the 
troublesome stones that have upset gravity.  Wendy 
has the ability to control gravity herself – by 
pressing up or down on the control pad while 
jumping, Wendy will cause gravity to reverse in 
that direction.  Most enemies and obstacles in the 
game world are also affected by the gravity 
switching – you'll need to manipulate gravity 
frequently to progress through the game's 
different puzzles. 
 
Stars can be used to power up Wendy's magic.  For 
every star that she collects (to a maximum of 
five), her magic will increase.  Beginning with a 
small weak shot, you can power your magic up to a 
spread shot that fires in three directions.  The 
stars also act as Wendy's health meter – if you 
get hit, you'll lose a star, as well as some 
magical power.  Get hit when you have no stars 
left, and you'll lose a life. 
 
At the end of every world, there is a short bonus 
stage with Wendy riding on her broomstick.  In 
these stages, you must attack enemies and collect 
stars as Wendy automatically flies to the next 
world.

Wings of Fury (c) Dec 27, 1999 Ed Magnin and 
Associates / Mindscape, Inc. 
 
Wings of Fury is an action game with some minor 
simulation aspects, in which you are the pilot of 
an American F6F Hellcat plane. The setting of the 
game is the Pacific during World War II. 
 
It is your job to defeat the Japanese by 
destroying enemy bunkers, machine gun nests and 
barracks on a series of islands. Barracks and gun 
nests can be bombarded with regular bombs, while 
you'll have to use rockets to take out the 
concrete bunkers. After a successful bombing run, 
return to mow down the Japanese soldiers with your 
machine guns. You also have to sink Japanese 
battleships with torpedoes and engage in dogfights 
with enemy fighter planes. 
 
 
You start each mission by taking off from an 
aircraft carrier, which you'll have to protect 
from assaults by Japanese torpedo planes. Whenever 
you run out of fuel, bombs, rockets or machine gun 
ammo you can replenish those by returning to your 
carrier. Your carrier is also the place to repair 
damage to your plane. 
 
The Gameboy Color version of Wings of Fury has a 
toned down violence level. You no longer mow down 
Japanese soldiers with your machine guns, instead 
you bombard jeeps & trucks. Also missing in this 
version are the Japanese torpedo planes and the 
small 1st-person view window. New are some extra 
manoeuvres for your plane like a barrel roll and a 
review of your ammo consumption after each 
mission. Using less ammo than allocated gives you 
bonus points.

Worms Armageddon (c) Jan 19, 2000 Infogrames 
Europe SA / Infogrames North America 
 
The final sequel (at least using the present 
engine) to the strategy game Worms, Worms 
Armageddon expands on Worms 2 by improving quite a 
few facets of gameplay and including play over the 
Internet through Team 17's WORMNET. 
 
For those who've never played Worms, it's at heart 
similar to the old game Artillery, which you 
control an artillery piece. In essence, you give 
it a shot angle and shot power, and try to hit 
your enemy, despite wind effects and the enemy 
firing back at you. Worms puts you in command of a 
team of Worms, but not only can you move around 
the landscape, you can use many types of weapons 
to try to dispatch the enemy, from bazookas to 
mini-guns to exploding sheep. 
 
Everything is presented in a humorous cartoonish 
style, from the landscapes to the worms themselves 
and their cries of triumph or despair, depending 
on how you do. 
 
Armageddon uses an enhanced version of the Worms 2 
engine, and while an improvement over Worms 2, 
it's not a huge change.

Also featured was a new career mode compared to 
that of WWF War Zone, realistic entrances and a 
first ever Create a PPV mode. The game featured 
over 40 of the then current WWF Superstars, 
including hidden ones. The Create A Wrestler

WWF Betrayal (c) Aug 07, 2001 WayForward 
Technologies / THQ Inc. 
 
WWF Betrayal is not the typical WWF game, instead 
the gameplay is more reminiscent of Double Dragon. 
 The player starts off as one of either four 
different superstars including The Rock, Triple H, 
The Undertaker or "Stone Cold" Steve Austin, after 
which the story kicks in.  The story consists of 
the player's selected wrestler just moments away 
from winning the WWF Championship before getting 
hit from behind by an unknown assailant and 
defeated.  They awake to discover that Stephanie 
McMahon has also kidnapped and her father Vince 
promises the player's character another shot at 
the title if they rescue Stephanie. 
 
There are six levels to choose from as the player 
will transverse these stages and fight off 
referees, street punks security guards and even 
other WWF superstars with a punch, kick, a 
dropkick or through various weapons scattered 
throughout the stage such as steel pipes, 
nightsticks, 2x4's along with many more objects.  
Not only does the player have to defeat enemies 
they also have to avoid various traps and pitfalls 
such as patches of fire, floor traps and laser 
cannons to name a few. 
 
There are also power-ups that are located in 
various places throughout the game which can 
replenish the player's health and power bar among 
many others.  Additionally, when the player fills 
up their power bar they can unleash their 
character's unique finishing move such as the 
Stone Cold Stunner or the Pedigree on a selected 
enemy.  There is also an option for a second 
player to join in using a link cable to team up 
and help out on their friend's journey.

stars as well as the option for 16 custom 
wrestlers. All the wrestlers come with their 
real-life theme music, entrance videos (made into

  Interactive Ltd. / Activision Publishing, Inc. 
 
Like it's bigger brother on the PlayStation, 
X-Men: Mutant Academy on the Game Boy Color is a 
fighting game starring Marvel's famous mutants. 
 
The character roster includes four X-Men (Cyclops, 
Wolverine, Storm and Gambit) and five evil Mutants 
(Magneto, Toad, Mystique, Sabretooth and Pyro). 
There are also two additional secret characters, 
whose unlocking codes are revealed upon beating 
the game's story mode. 
 
In addition to the story mode, in which one 
character takes on all the others in consecutive 
fights, there is a training mode, battle mode 
(featuring teams of three characters each), 
survival mode (one character taking on all others 
with only a single bar of health) and a versus 
mode utilizing the Game Link cable. 
 
The Game Boy's two buttons are used for kicks and 
punches (or basic mutant abilities like Cyclops' 
eye beam). During a fight, a rage bar will slowly 
fill, which allows using powerful special attacks 
activated through button combos.

You can change the character at any time during

power level decreases as you go. When you change a

the power level increases. Also, some areas can

the fly-like Yar, which can destroy the shield 
piece by piece by either shooting it or running 
into it. Once the shield is down, you will need to 
use the Zorlon cannon to destroy the Qotile. The 
Zorlon cannon is located on the left side of the 
screen, and when fired can destroy the Qotile with 
a direct hit. The Qotile isn't completely unarmed 
against your attacks, however. Wandering around 
the screen is a destroyer missile, which will 
constantly be homing in on your Yar. This missile 
can not be destroyed, however you can temporarily 
hide from it in a shield which runs vertically in 
the center of the screen. The Yar will be unable 
to fire when hiding in the shield so you can't 
stay there indefinitely! The Qotiles second weapon 
is a swirl which it will randomly fire at you and 
should be dodged. When you finally destroy the 
Qotile you can move on to the next, faster round 
of gameplay. Several game variations are included 
which control the difficulty and speed of the 
game.

Yogi Bear - Great Balloon Blast (c) Dec, 2000 
Taito Corporation / BAM! Entertainment, Inc. 
 
It's the 14th annual Jellystone Park Balloon Fest. 
And you know what that means for Yogi...campers 
with pic-a-nic baskets! Yogi has a plan to get 
those baskets. He'll pose as a balloon salesman. 
He just needs to avoid Ranger Smith. 
 
Boo Boo: "But, Yogi, the Ranger isn't going to 
like this." 
Yogi: "Not to worry, Boo Boo, I'm smarter than the 
average bear!" 
 
This is a puzzle game requiring strategy. A cloud 
above will hold several colored balloons while 
moving left or right. When it reaches the screen 
edge, it drops down a bit. You have a picnic 
basket with two balloons attached. By pressing the 
B button, you can rotate the balloons 90º and swap 
the colors. By pressing the A button, you release 
the balloons. The object is to get three balloons 
of the same color to touch. They will then pop and 
will be gone. Remember, the cloud is moving so 
time your release so the balloons go where you 
want. You are trying to clear all the balloons to 
move on. 
 
Every fourth level is a boss level where you have 
Ranger Smith on top of the cloud. He stomps the 
cloud to lower it and drops a stone. If the stone 
hits your basket, you will release your balloons, 
whether you want to or not, and will not be able 
to move for a couple seconds. Once you clear all 
these balloons, you will have defeated Ranger 
Smith and will move on to the next area. If you 
match a balloon with an arrow in it, the cloud 
will move up a little. If the balloons reach the 
bottom, you lose. You can then choose to restart 
the level you were on or end the game.

Zebco Fishing! (c) 1999 Vicarious Visions, Inc. / 
Vatical Entertainment LLC 
 
Zebco Fishing! is an officially licensed fishing 
game for the Game Boy Color. It features 11 
different lures and 2 lakes to fish on. The player 
can participate in a tournament and Blackjack 
Bass. The tournament mode gives you a limited time 
to catch the biggest fish. In Blackjack Bass you 
have to catch 21 pounds worth of fish, similar to 
the game Black Jack. Each time you catch a fish, 
you get its weight and can decide to "hit" or 
"hold". If you exceed the 21 pounds you lose. 
 
The player can row his boat around the lake until 
he has found a suitable fishing location, where he 
can cast his line and wait for the fish to bite. 
Once a fish is nibbling the bait the player has to 
hook it and then reel it in. When you do so you 
must make sure your line doesn't break by keeping 
an eye on the tension. 
 
Weather conditions, time of day and location all 
have impact on the chance of catching a fish. Each 
type of lure also improves the odds in specific 
types of water and weather types. Somewhere in the 
two lakes also dwells the legendary Lochness Bass 
a giant fish which is yet to be caught.

Addams Family, The - Pugsley's Scavenger Hunt (c) 
Jul, 1993 Ocean Software Ltd. / Ocean Software 
Ltd. 
 
The Addams Family: Pugsley's Scavenger Hunt is a 
side-scrolling platformer based on the second 
animated TV series The Addams Family (1992). The 
entire Addams family is being held captive by 
various monsters throughout the mansion, and 
Pugsley needs to rescue them. They are hidden in 
various parts of the mansion, e.g. the forest, 
which can be accessed in any order. The gameplay 
follows the usual platforming standards: Pugsley 
moves from left to right while jumping a lot and 
avoiding enemies. 
 
This version of the game is heavily based on the 
SNES version of The Addams Family - it features 
the same storyline with another main character and 
almost identical level design. Another difference 
to the SNES version of this game is that Pugsley 
can only take two hits before dying - but there is 
an additional power-up that makes him faster and 
gives him an extra hit.

The Addams Family is a side-scrolling platformer 
based on the movie of the same name. The player 
takes the role of Gomez who searches for his 
missing family members. To find them he has to 
explore six different parts of the mansion, e.g. 
the forest or the graveyard, which are basic 
platform levels: the player moves from left to 
right while jumping a lot and avoiding enemies. In 
contrast to the other versions of the game he has 
weapons to his disposal, e.g. a throwing knife. 
Other differences are a unique level design and 
another health system: Gomez has five hearts which 
practically act like a life meter because every 
hit only takes away a part of a heart.

In Adventure Island II: Aliens in Paradise the 
player takes the role of Master Higgins who has to 
save his cavegirl from aliens which also want to 
dominate the Earth. The basic gameplay elements 
are the same as in its predecessor Adventure 
Island: Master Higgins walks through the levels 
while fighting against various enemies. One hit 
results in his untimely death unless he carries 
one of the various power ups, e.g. weapons or a 
skateboard which improves his speed. He also needs 
to collect food to fill up his steadily decreasing 
starvation bar - death awaits if it hits zero. 
 
A big addition are dinosaurs which serve as mount 
and offer different abilities, e.g. flying or 
shooting fireballs. Like all power ups these don't 
have to be used instantly but can be saved for 
later: before every level the player can choose 
the power ups he wants to bring with him. There 
are overall eight worlds with different themes 
which are represented by a overhead map. Sometimes 
there are different paths with other level and at 
the end of a world Master Higgins has to fight a 
boss.

As Lolo, king of eden land, you have to puzzle 
your way through numerous screen-sized rooms. In 
each room, you have to collect all heart frames in 
order to open a treasure chest which contains the 
key to the exit. 
 
Different terrain types and enemies have to be 
avoided or used to your advantage to get all the 
heart frames. Some enemies don't hurt you at all, 
others only awaken once all heart frames are 
collected. Some shoot you as soon you cross their 
line of sight, then there are enemies that fall 
asleep and stay where they are once you touch 
them. 
 
Terrain types include grass that enemies cannot 
cross, sand that slows you down, but not the 
enemies, stones that cannot be crossed but also 
block enemy shots, trees that cannot be crossed 
but don not block enemy shots, water that can only 
be crossed with a bridge or an egg, arrows that 
cannot be crossed in the direction opposite that 
of which they are facing and others. 
 
Some heart frames give Lolo the ability to turn 
enemies into eggs and push them around like boxes. 
Eggs can be used to cross water, trap enemies or 
block their shots. In some levels, collecting two 
heart frames gives Lolo access to one of three 
items. These items are: A hammer that crushes 
stones, a bridge that can be used to cross water 
and an arrow that changes the direction an arrow 
tile is facing.

Natasha have disguised themselves as security 
guards for the museum and managed to steal some of 
the priceless artifacts. 
 
Bullwinkle and Rocky must track down the stolen 
artifacts and return order to Frostbite Falls.  
Most of the action is of the side-scrolling 
platformer variety, but along the way, you will 
get to play lots of mini-games involving 
characters from the show. During the platforming 
sections you can switch instantly between the two 
protagonists. Both play differently: Bullwinkle 
can throw bombs at enemies and Rocky can fly for 
short instances.

In the year 2593, on the planet Alpha Centauri 3, 
Predators looking for a hunting ground plant Alien 
eggs. The Aliens soon hatch and wipe out the human 
population. However, when the Predators move in 
for the hunt, they find they are vastly 
outnumbered and suffer the same fate. Only one of 
them survives. He theorizes that among the hatched 
Aliens there was a queen that laid additional 
eggs, which would explain the huge number of 
Aliens. The last survivor sets out to destroy the 
queen and regain the honor of his clan. 
 
The Predator must traverse several side-scrolling 
levels on his way to the queen, while destroying 
Aliens in all their forms - facehuggers hatched 
from eggs, chestburster aliens and fully grown 
warriors. Various weapons are available: the 
standard weapon are the wrist blades. Ammunition 
for the shoulder cannon, the cutting disks and 
bombs must be picked up. The bombs not only work 
as weapons but can also be used to destroy 
barriers. To avoid a fight altogether, the 
Predator can also use his invisibility system, 
which runs down the energy supply. To recharge it, 
energy powerups must be collected. Also hidden in 
the levels are keys that open up doors blocking 
the way into the next area. A small radar map 
helps in navigating the maze-like corridors and 
also displays approaching enemies.

or into holes to make them traversable, however, 
since there are crates and holes in several 
different shapes and sizes, this is much more 
difficult than it seems at first. Furthermore, 
many levels contain different types of spinning 
doors that make solving the levels even more 
complicated. 
 
The game features four different modes of play: a 
Beginners Mode in which the basics are explained 
and the player receives hints on how to solve each 
level

Another Bible (c) Mar 02, 1995 Dice Co., Ltd. / 
Atlus Co., Ltd. 
 
Once upon a time, there was a huge war between the 
humans and the demons. After prolonged battles, 
both sides came to an agreement and established 
peace. But now, things start changing. A demon 
cult is becoming popular, and demons no longer 
wish to live in peace with the humans. Only you, 
the Hero of the game (nameless), aided by the 
Heroine (also nameless) and other friends, is able 
to bring peace back to the planet. 
 
The Heroine has a special ability: she can talk to 
the demons you meet in random battles and persuade 
them to join your party. You can store those 
demons, collect them, and summon them in battles. 
Demons are divided into various races and species. 
Otherwise, the game uses a standard turn-based 
combat with physical attacks and magic spells. 
 
The game is a part of Megaten universe, but unlike 
most other Megaten games (with the exception of  
Last Bible series), it is set in a medieval world.

Aretha (c) 1990 Japan Art Media / Yanoman 
Corporation 
 
In a far away land, war was raging, as an evil 
ruler sent his troops to invade the castle of a 
mighty king. His minions stormed the castle and 
burnt it down. The king could not escape his fate, 
and the villain thought no one was spared by his 
wrath... 
 
Present time. You are Ariel, a little girl who 
lives with her old wise grandmother in a small 
house near a mountain range, north to the forest. 
She just turned ten, and the grandmother sends her 
on a seemingly simple quest: to go through the 
forest to Nineveh, the nearby town, and to meet 
there a certain person. But what starts as a 
simple assignment soon develops into the quest for 
magic powers of Aretha, the ultimate battle 
against the evil, and the discovery of Ariel's own 
true identity. 
 
The game is a console-style RPG, where Ariel and 
her party travel on the world map, through 
forests, mountain paths, and caves, occasionally 
visiting towns and fighting monsters in turn-based 
combat viewed from first-person perspective, using 
a variety of physical and special attacks.

The game continues the story of the young princess 
Ariel. After she rightfully regained her throne, 
people enjoyed a peaceful life under her 
benevolent reign. But this peaceful existence did 
not last long... Two adventurers who were 
wandering through mountains met a mysterious evil 
being, who threatened to ruin Ariel's kingdom. 
After that, the two men disappeared without a 
trace. Ariel's servants reported to her about the 
matter. After consulting her wise grandmother, 
Ariel decided to go out herself, to meet up with 
her old trusty companions and to find out the 
origin of the new threat. 
 
The game is a console-style RPG - you fight random 
enemies in turn-based combat viewed from 
first-person perspective. Enemies may attack you 
from the sides, and you should pay attention which 
enemy you face. A unique feature the game uses is 
the ability to get special items called "souls" 
after battles, and then to use them to forge your 
own armor.

Atomic Punk, which was released as Dynablaster in 
Europe and Bomber Boy in Japan, is a game from 
Hudson Soft's Bomberman series. 
 
The game offers two single player and two 
multiplayer modes. The single player mode called 
"Game B" has the classical Bomberman gameplay, 
while the mode "Game A" introduces several 
variations. The levels in Game A are divided in 
nine areas, which can be accessed in any order 
from a world map. Depending on the time taken to 
finish a level and the number of blocks destroyed, 
the player gets a certain amount of gold, which 
can be used to buy power-ups (called "panels" in 
the game) in shop, which in term is accessed from 
the map. Power-ups allow, for example, to revive 
Bomberman when he dies in a stage or to increase 
the length of an explosion. Before entering a new 
area, the player chooses which panels to use in 
order to complete the area. 
 
The multiplayer mode are both player vs. player 
modes. In "Panel mode", each player can place only 
one bomb at a time and the bombs' radius starts at 
one, but panels appear in the field to improve 
this. In "Powerful mode", no panels appear, but 
each player can place up to four bombs at a time 
and the radius is four.

Bamse, the strongest bear in the world, is a

Andréasson in 1962. This is his first appearance

age of the dinosaurs. But the mischievous Vargen 
sneaks along and kidnaps Skalman to his "doomed

Bamse is not an original game. Instead it is a 
re-skinned version of  Baby T-Rex by the same 
developer. This explains why the settings of the 
game appears out of context with very little to do

pitchers battle it out against a lineup of heavy 
hitters using fast, slow, curving and special 
pitches.  Each player brings their own unique 
stats and abilities to the game as you work your 
way through progressively more challenging teams. 
 
This portable version of Bases Loaded is loosely 
based on the title for the original NES.  In this 
scaled down version Major League teams are 
replaced with two teams representing the East and 
West Coast Divisions. With two Game Boy units and 
a Video Link cable players can go head to head - 
although each player will also need their own game 
cartridge. Single players can enjoy a quick pickup 
game by selecting an unofficial game of 1 to 9 
innings. An official game will allow a victorious 
team to move on to consecutive matches against 
progressively more challenging teams, a feature 
that substitutes for the traditional 'Season Mode' 
of most baseball titles. But you'll have to do 
this in a single sitting as no battery save option 
was included. 
 
Play in USA or Japan mode for a subtle change in 
the gameplay or learn how to best utilize the 
strengths of the East and West teams. Pitchers are 
rated 1 to 5 and batters get a rating for both 
running speed and hitting ability.

The Joker lives again in SunSoft's sequel to their 
NES 
original. The Joker has somehow managed to escape 
from Arkham Asylum once again, and Batman must 
fight him across seven stages to restore peace to 
Gotham City. 
 
Batman carries a gauntlet shooting basic bullets 
by default. This can be upgraded with weapon 
powerups located in boxes throughout the level, 
giving access to homing and energy weapons. Every 
upgrade weapon can be charged up for a secondary 
attack, different for each weapon. Batman also has 
a slide useful against most enemies and some 
bosses. 
 
Boss fights introduce a system where life is 
measured by points instead of tick marks or bars. 
In these sections, Batman has significantly more 
health, and can take many more hits when rumbling 
with these stronger foes. 
 
Levels include a snowy landscape, moving train, 
military base, and sewers. Two levels require you 
to run and dodge explosions while vehicles keep 
pace in the background. Some levels also have 
Batman activate a jetpack and play through a short 
side-scrolling shooter. 
 
This game is one of the few Batman games that was 
not based directly on a movie or television 
series.

you encounter. In other levels, you are flying or 
racing along, shooting or avoiding enemies. At the 
end of each level, there is a boss battle. While 
it shares the same name and main characters as the 
other versions, the levels and most enemies in 
this version differ greatly.

Ltd. / Hudson Soft Company, Ltd. 
 
This is a Japan only release, not to be confused 
with the USA release Bomberman GB, which is a 
different game. 
 
In the one player game, you are placed in an arena 
with a dark Bomberman for a best-two-out-of-three 
round. You must, using your bombs, blow him up 
without getting blown up yourself. After you beat 
him, the process repeats with two Bombermen then 
three Bombermen. 
 
After you beat the three Bombermen in two out of 
three rounds, you must beat a boss character to 
move on. When playing the rounds, you can find 
power-ups to increase the blast size, allow more 
than one bomb on the screen and, temporarily, make 
you invincible. When you beat the bosses, you gain 
things like the ability to kick a bomb away, run 
faster, ram enemies, etc. 
 
In a multi-player game, two to four players do 
their best to blow each other up. Multi-player is 
done with the Super Game Boy on a SNES. More than 
two players is only possible with a multitap. 
 
This game was released in the U.S. as Wario Blast, 
with some changes. The animated opening was 
removed and, of course, Wario was added.

In Bomb Jack, the player controls Jack, who must

sounds easy, right? Wrong! Making Jack's task 
difficult are numerous enemies such as birds, 
mummies, turtles, and orbs. 
 
In each round, collecting a number of bombs 
results in a bonus coin appearing, and collecting 
this coin will make the player's score increase 2 
to 4 times. More often than not, the "power ball" 
appears, and when you collect this, you can defeat 
enemies and have more time to collect all the 
bombs. There is also the "E" coin, which gives 
Jack one additional life, but rarely does this 
coin appear. 
 
The more you progress through the game, the more 
difficult it becomes, as enemies travel more 
quickly to get you.

In this sequel to Boxxle, Willy's girlfriend has

enough money to buy a rocket and rescue her. And 
what better way is there to earn money than 
pushing  crates? And there are lots of crates to 
be pushed in all 120  levels of the game. The new 
levels are the major difference between Boxxle 2 
and its predecessor as there are no graphical 
changes to speak of. To solve all these levels, 
you'll once again have to push crates onto certain 
spots, which is made difficult by the fact that 
you can only push but not pull them so that it can 
easily happen that you push a crate into a dead 
end or block your own way. A password records your 
progress, but there is no battery to save your

name. Players take the role of Jonathan Harker 
whose mission to to destroy Count Dracula by first 
heading to Transylvania and then London. 
 
Jonathan Harker can move left and right, jump and 
attack with a weapon, the most basic of which is a 
knife. The status display on the screen shows 
Harker's health bar, countdown timer to complete 
the level and currently held weapon.  Throughout 
the levels question mark boxes (similar to the 
Mario games) can be found, attacking these will 
reveal power ups which include health restoration, 
timer increase and new weapons. Among these new 
weapons are axes, daggers and a shotgun. Question 
mark boxes can also be used as platforms to reach 
other areas and enemies. Each stage is divided 
into two sections: the "Daytime" and the 
"Nighttime". These are entirely different levels 
comparable to stage 1-a and 1-b. Harker must jump 
to various platforms and obstacles and defeat 
minor enemies throughout the levels. The end of a 
Nighttime level is usually guarded by a boss 
creature who must be defeated to progress.

Bubble Ghost (c) 1990 ERE Informatique / FCI 
 
Bubble Ghost needs to blow a bubble out of his 
creator's castle. Your task is to guide him so as 
to direct the bubble through the gaps in each 
room. The bubble's direction is affected by which 
part of the ghost hits it. 
 
Candles, fans, and other obstacles serve to make 
little Bubble Ghost's task harder. Bubble Ghost is 
invincible, but the bubble is prone to bursting if 
it hits anything at pace. You have five bubbles 
before the game is over.

Bubsy is back! After defeating the evil Woolies in 
the first game, Bubsy, the brave bob-cat, has to 
participate in an even more dangerous adventure: 
to explore a mysterious hyperdimensional mansion, 
inside of which there are portals that lead to 
different area in different locations and times. 
 
Similarly to  Sonic games, Bubsy moves very fast 
and can also jump very high. Bubsy kills the 
enemies by jumping on their heads. The levels are 
large and can be accessed right from the beginning 
of the game (except the ultimate level), starting 
in either west or east wing. There are five types 
of regular levels: Egyptian pyramid, sci-fi 
space-like environment, a world filled with 
musical instruments and notes, a "green" level 
with trees and hills, and a side-scrolling group 
of levels where Bubsy has to navigate an airplane.

everything on screen. 
 
Burai Fighter Deluxe is identical to the NES 
version of Burai Fighter. The "Deluxe" part refers 
to the added versus multiplayer mode through the 
link cable functionality that is included with 
this Game Boy release.

Catrap (c) Jun 01, 1990 Ask Kodansha / Ask 
Kodansha 
 
Catrap is a single screen puzzle game with 100 
rounds. You and your sister (or girlfriend?) have 
somehow been turned into cat-humans and you're are 
trapped in a castle full of baddies. The gameplay 
is best described as a mix between Boulder Dash 
and Soko-Ban. 
 
The goal is to clear each screen of bad guys, in 
100 increasingly difficult rounds. You can punch a 
bad guy by walking onto it from the left or right. 
You can't attack from above or below, but you can 
stand on top of a monster, or underneath a 
monster. Other elements to make the game more 
interesting are loose ground which you can stand 
on or dig through, ladders to climb and boulders 
you can push around. 
 
You can choose to play each round as a boy or a 
girl, but this doesn't affect gameplay, only the 
background music. In some rounds, both the boy and 
the girl are present at the same time. You can 
then switch between them with select-button, using 
both of them in clever ways to solve the rounds. 
During the game, you can rewind to undo certain 
moves. You can play the rounds in any order, so 
you can skip to more difficult ones and solve them 
at a later time. There is a round editor to create 
your own puzzles, but these self made rounds can't 
be saved.

Championship Pool (c) Nov, 1993 Bitmasters, Inc. / 
Mindscape, Inc. 
 
Championship Pool is a pool game where players can 
8-ball or 9-ball pool tournament that starts off 
with the BCA Regional Championship where the 
player must defeat 32 opponents in a first to four 
games match. If the player loses against any of 
the 32 opponents, they are then eliminated from 
the tournament. The winner of that then goes onto 
the World Championship. 
 
All of the gameplay is done from a top down view 
of the table. The player moves an icon to indicate 
location they want to hit the ball too. To aid in 
the aiming, a ghost of the cue ball and the first 
ball that is hit is repetitively played out to 
show the path of the hit ball. With the all the 
shots there is a very small margin of error, but 
this is only notable when a long shot is played or 
a shot from a sharp angle and the ghost balls will 
randomly play out all the possible occurrences. 
The player can also change the power and spin of 
the played shot with the ghost balls will updating 
to show the outcome of those changes. 
 
There are 4 different game modes that can be 
chosen, each with a different set of pool games. 
The different game modes and there games are: 
 
1. Tournament: The player must defeat 32 
   different players in a first to four knockout 
   tournament in 8-ball or 9-ball pool before 
   going on to the World Championship. During the 
   tournament the opponent is never actually is 
   seen playing there shots. Instead, when it is 
   the opponents turn, it cuts to an image of the 
   player with a caption and then returns the 
   control to the player with some balls removed 
   and moved. This way the opponent can finish the 
   game within 4 turns regardless of if they where 
   snookered or not. 
 
2. Challenge:  It has many different pool games 
   that are played, all with one player without an 
   opponent. The games are: 
 
1. 14.1 Challenge – After the break the ball is 
   placed anywhere at the top of the table behind 
   the line. At that point, the player can hit any 
   ball but once the fails to hit a ball in a hole 
   the game is over. If there is only one ball 
   left on the table the rest of the balls are 
   re-racked and play continues. At the end score 
   is given based on the number of balls that 
   where hit in the holes. The score are tallied 
   up over 5 games to get the total score. 
 
2. Eight Ball - After the break the ball is 
   placed anywhere at the top of the table behind 
   the line. The player must hit all the chosen 
   set of balls (stripes or solids) and the 8-ball 
   in one turn.  The score is based on how many 
   balls where hit in. 
 
3. Nine Ball - After the break the ball is 
   placed anywhere at the top of the table behind 
   the line. The player must hit the 9 ball in one 
   turn. The score is based on how many balls 
   where hit in. 
 
4. Equal Offence – Same as 14.1 Challenge but 
   there is only one game played. 
 
5. Three Pool – Only have 3 balls on the table. 
   Score is based on how many shots it takes to 
   get all three balls in with lower been better. 
 
6. Speed Pool – Objective is to hit all the 
   balls in as quickly as possible as a timer is 
   timing how long the game takes. Any ball can be 
   hit at any time and the player can miss the 
   shot and not be penalised (other than taking 
   longer). 
 
3. Party:  It has many different multiplayer 
   pool games that are played with ether just 2 or 
   2 to 8 human players. The games are: 
 
1. Eight Ball (2 Players)  – A standard eight 
   ball game with the players taking turns to 
   play. 
 
7. Nine Ball (2-8 Players)  – A standard nine 
   ball game with up to 8 players taking turns. 
   First player to get the 9-ball in wins. 
 
8. 14.1 Continuous (2 Players)  – Players can 
   hit any ball in for a point. If a shot is 
   missed then other player plays. If there is 
   only one ball on the table the pocketed balls 
   are re-racked. Play continues until one of the 
   players reaches the score chosen at the start 
   of the game. 
 
9. Ten Ball (2-8 Players)  – Same as Nine Ball 
   except with 10 balls. 
 
10. Rotation (2-8 Players)  – Only the lowest 
    ball can be hit and the score for getting a 
    ball in is the value of the ball (e.g. 8-ball 
    is 8 points). Player with the highest score at 
    the end of the game wins. 
 
11. Straight Pool (2 Players)  –  Same as 14.1 
    Continuous but the player with the highest 
    score after one game wins. 
 
12. Equal Offence (2-8 Players)  –  Same as 
    Equal Offence in challenge mode but players 
    can take turns to beat each others score. 
 
13. Fifteen Ball (2-8 Players)  – Same as 
    Rotation except that any ball can be hit not 
    just the lowest. 
 
14. One Pocket (2 Players)  – The two players 
    are given one of the two pockets at the end of 
    the table. The player must hit all the balls 
    in there nominated pocket with the one with

suspects, you must keep bumping into their car 
until it is no longer functional. And you have to 
do this under a strict time limit. You can't 
afford to crash into cars or buildings or you 
waste time getting on the road again. 
 
However, once you've caught up with your suspect, 
you are given more time. Your car is also equipped 
with turbo boosts, which you can use to gain extra 
speed if you are way behind the criminal. Each 
arrest is based on a "suspicion".

Crash 'N the Boys: Street Challenge (c) 1992 
Technos Japan Corp. / American Technos Inc. 
 
Another tournament composed of several different 
challenges rocks the streets near Nekketsu High 
and since the series hero Kunio isn't going to 
turn down a challenge anytime soon, every gang in 
the city sends its team hoping to come up on top. 
 
Crash 'N the Boys: Street Challenge features the 
same basic gameplay engine and mechanics found in 
the rest of the Kunio/Nekketsu High games. The 
player controls a character in side-scrolling 
levels and try to defeat opponents using an 
arsenal of attacks and special moves. Unique to 
this game is that in order to clear the five 
stages, the player must also accomplish a series 
of sport-themed objectives. There is a throwing 
event, a golfing event, swimming, jumping, and 
all-out fighting events, all with unique twists 
inspired by the street/gangs theme of the game 
(e.g. the jumping event involves jumping across 
the rooftops in the city). 
 
Depending on the player's performance in each 
event they may earn medals that can be exchanged 
for power-ups and stat increases. The game 
supports two players co-op or vs. gameplay.

Darius+ (c) Dec 13, 1991 Taito Corporation / Taito 
Corporation 
 
Darius was Taito's effort to compete in the 
arcades against the likes of R-Type and Gradius. 
Technically impressive, it featured three screens 
depicting the largest playfield seen in a game so 
far (the same system was employed for Ninja 
Warriors), with the player sitting atop a big set 
of loudspeakers. Visually and audibly, it was a 
league above Irem's and Konami's offerings. 
 
When Taito (and others) ported the game to home 
machines, they were forced to shrink the playfield 
to fit in one single screen, and re-dubbed it 
Darius Plus. 
 
The plot of Darius involves the two heroes Proco 
Jr. and Tiat Young fighting the menaces posed by 
galactic fish and other sea animals again their 
homeworld. 
 
What sets Darius apart from other shoot'em-ups of 
the time is its way of letting the player choose 
his path with a certain amount of freedom. At the 
end of each area (level), you are able to choose 
between one of two worlds which the area branches 
into. This renders a higher replay value, since 
there are many paths to reach the end of the game 
by. 
Apart from this, the gameplay is on the simplistic 
side, both due to unimaginative attack waves and 
little interaction with the surroundings, but 
mainly due to the very basic powerup system, which 
is nowhere near the complexity of the 
aforementioned R-Type's and Gradius'.

Days of Thunder (c) 1992 Argonaut Software Ltd. /

Tom Cruise's film brought NASCAR racing to the 
masses, and Mindscape did the same for games 
players with this license. If you mentally change 
the driver names, it can be thought of as a 
recreation of real NASCAR racing rather than a 
direct recreation of the film. 
 
You play Cruise's Cole Trickle character (his 
name, like many of the others, is slightly 
different to that of a real NASCAR racer of the 
day) against your rivals on 8 tracks, based on 
real-life counterparts. The races are all on 
ovals, although the exact lengths, corner types 
and gradients are varied.  This means that the 
ideal racing line on one track can put you into 
the wall on another. Qualifying is incorporated 
alongside the races themselves. 
 
From times to times you'll have to pull into the 
pit stop area. When doing so, you control the five 
members of the pit crew. Loosing time on pit will 
make you loose positions at the race. The other 
racers, however, never pit. 
 
The NES version has 3rd-Person perspective only.

Based on the Disney cartoon Talespin. Baloo's 
airline cargo company, Higher for Hire, makes 
deliveries all around the world. The air pirates, 
lead by the daring Don Karnage have increased 
their attacks against air travel. In order to foil 
the plans of the pirates, Baloo trades in his 
normal plane for a "Mini Sea Duck", designed to 
fly more maneuverably.To get his cargo delivered 
on time, Baloo must fly over many dangerous areas, 
and also pick up any cargo stolen  or scattered by 
the air pirates. Eventually, the fortress of the 
air pirates themselves must be destroyed for air 
travel to remain safe and profitable. 
 
Talespin is a side-scrolling shooter, moving left 
to right across the screen. The Mini-Seaduck can 
fire projectiles and switch direction, flying 
right-to-left while upside-down. The money you 
make from recovery of these cargo items can be 
used to purchase upgrades at the end of each level 
from Wildcat, the mechanic. Many strange boss 
creatures and devices will guard the final areas 
of most levels.

Gameplay is similar also, and consists of much 
platform jumping and banana collecting.

Set in a post-apocalyptic New York, Double Dragon 
is the story of Billy and Jimmy Lee, twin brothers 
trained in the fighting style of Sou-Setsu-Ken. 
Together, they manage a small martial arts 
training school, teaching their students in 
self-defense. One day, Billy's girlfriend, Marian, 
is kidnapped off the street by the "Black 
Warriors", a savage street gang led by a man named 
Willy. The Black Warriors demand the Lee brothers

for Marian's freedom. The Lee brothers set out on 
a rescue mission to crush the Black Warriors and 
save Marian. 
 
Using whatever techniques they have at their

invulnerable elbow strike, as well any weapon that 
comes into their hands, the Lee brothers must 
pursue the gang through the city slum, industrial 
area and the forest before reaching their hideout

Double Dragon 2 (c) Dec, 1991 Technos Japan Corp. 
/ Acclaim Entertainment, Inc. 
 
The lovely Marian was rescued from the clutches of 
the Black Warriors gang by Billy & Jimmy Lee in 
the first Double Dragon game, but now the gang has 
killed her in retaliation of their early defeat. 
The Dragons must now embark on a mission to avenge 
her death and defeat the Black Warriors for the 
second and final time. 
 
The original arcade version of "Double Dragon II" 
was essentially an improved version of the first 
game. In addition to offering renewed audio and 
visuals, as well as new traps, moves and enemy 
characters, "Double Dragon II" discarded the 
conventional punch and kick buttons in favor of a 
direction-oriented attacking system similar to the 
original Technos beat-em-up Renegade. 
 
The NES version offered new stages, new moves and 
illustrated cut-scenes, as well as a new final 
boss and a new ending. Unlike the first NES game, 
it offered 2-Player Co-Op gameplay with the option 
to turn off the friendly fire. 
 
The Game Boy version of "Double Dragon II" is an 
English localization of a "Kunio-kun" game (the 
Japanese franchise which inspired "Renegade" and 
"River City Ransom" and has nothing to do with the 
arcade and NES versions.

can select different time limits for games, select 
teams, and begin playing! Gameplay is entirely 
action, so no time needs to be spent customizing 
the teams or with statistics. You control each 
player on the team one at a time (the player with 
or about to receive the ball will be human 
controlled, with the computer taking over the 
other players temporarily.) Some versions feature 
a small amount of digitized sound effects, and 
close ups of slam dunks.

Bikkuri Nekketsu Shinkiroku! - Dokodemo Kin Medal 
(c) 1990 Technos Japan Corp. / Technos Japan Corp. 
 
Another day at Nekketsu High, another gang 
tournament... but this time its different! A 
wealthy school principal has placed a challenge 
for all the school gangs to compete in a special 
obstacle course composed of 4 different challenges 
that you and your team must overcome. First in 
line is a race across the city streets (and 
rooftops), next is an obstacle course filled with 
dangerous hazards, then a jumping challenge in 
which you have to break a series of metal balls, 
and finally an all-out fighting tournament. 
 
The game uses the same engine and basic gameplay 
mechanics featured in other Nekketsu High games, 
with the only change being the goals you must 
complete to clear each stage. Seeing as how the 
characters are gang members, fighting and beating 
your opponents can be a viable way of winning the 
challenges, so several weapons and power-ups can 
also be found in the courses

then watches as the events take place and awaits

The Game Boy version for Dragon's Lair is actually 
a port of Roller Coaster, with its protagonist 
replaced by Dirk the Daring. Dirk must collect all 
"lifestones" scattered all around the game world 
(by walking or jumping) to finally save Princess 
Daphne. The game world is divided in several 
screens which can be freely navigated and are a 
little wider than Game Boy's screen. As Dirk moves 
the screen will scroll and when its limit is 
reached, it will flick to a new one. To help him 
move around, Dirk can jump over bumper cars, 
flying magic hats and other kinds of moving 
platforms. 
 
Dirk starts with 10 lives which can be lost by 
falling from high platforms, touching spikes or 
landing on water or fire. The main theme is 
somewhat reminiscent from the NES version. The 
game can be played in two different speeds and can 
also be played by two players taking turns.

paper.  When they show it to Uncle Scrooge, he 
recognizes it as part of his great, great Uncle 
Fergus McDuck's legendary treasure map!  With the 
remaining parts of the map hidden around the 
world, it's up to Uncle Scrooge to find them and 
discover Fergus McDuck's secret treasure! 
 
Duck Tales 2 is the sequel to the NES and Game Boy 
game, Duck Tales.  Based on the Disney cartoon of 
the same name, players control Uncle Scrooge as he 
searches the globe for massive amounts of wealth 
while trying to discover hidden pieces of the map. 
 
Scrooge's main method of attack is his cane - by 
jumping in the air and holding the B Button, the 
cane turns into a pogo stick, allowing players to 
jump onto most enemies' heads and cross dangerous 
terrain like spikes with ease.  By pushing up 
against a wall or an object, Scrooge will whack 
his cane like a golf club, either sending the 
object flying or occasionally revealing secret 
items.  New to Duck Tales 2 is the ability to push 
and pull certain objects with the cane after 
hitting them. 
 
Familiar faces such as Huey, Dewey and Louie, 
Webby, Mrs. Beakley, and Launchpad McQuack all 
turn up to lend a hand.  Scrooge will even bump 
into the crazy inventor, Gyro Gearloose, who will 
improve Scrooge's cane so that he can access even 
more secret areas.

Elevator Action (c) 1991 Taito Corporation / Taito 
Corporation 
 
You are Agent 17 (codename: "Otto"). Your mission 
is to secure all top secret documents from a 
security building and escape in the getaway car, 
located in the basement of the building. 
 
Enemies spies are scattered throughout the 
30-floor building and they have only one mission: 
execute Agent 17 at all costs. There are several 
ways in which Agent 17 can kill them: 
 
1. Shooting them with his gun. 
2. Kicking them by jumping onto them. 
3. Shooting a light on the ceiling while in an 
   elevator, dropping the light onto one of them. 
4. Crushing them with an elevator. 
 
Whenever a light has been dropped, the hallways 
will be dark for a short period of time, making 
the enemy spies harder to see. The same holds true 
for hallways that are already dark. 
 
While Otto is in an elevator, he will have 
complete control of it by moving up or down. Agent 
17 can still get killed if he's already in an 
elevator if a bullet's trajectory is aimed at it.. 
When Otto is not in an elevator, it will move from 
floor to floor automatically, even when enemy 
spies are in it. Otto is able to leap over the 
elevator gaps, but he must be as close to the edge 
as possible without falling off in order to make 
the jump safely. If there is an elevator cable in 
the way, however, it will block him, causing him 
to fall. 
 
Just because the game is called Elevator Action 
doesn't mean that elevators are the only means of 
travel. There are also escalators which you can 
ride up or down, useful if you want to avoid 
gunfire and don't have time to jump. 
 
Otto must go into the rooms with red doors to 
collect the top secret documents. If he tries to 
get to his car without getting all the documents, 
he cannot escape and must go back and collect the 
remaining documents. Once he has all the documents 
and drives away, he then proceeds to the next 
building. 
 
If Otto takes too much time to collect the 
documents, the alarm will go off, and he will have 
trouble controlling the elevators, which will take 
time to react. Bad guys will be especially 
aggressive. The alarm doesn't go off when Otto 
loses a life, it only resets after finishing a 
building. Besides ducking, bad guys may also drop 
themselves and lay flat on the floor. It's 
virtually impossible for Otto to shoot bad guys 
when they do this. Also, Otto cannot duck when in 
an elevator.

obstacles can be pushed out of the way, and some 
you must find a way around. You need to be careful 
when navigating around the screens, if you cause 
any boulders to fall and they land on you a life 
is lost. Also wandering about are a variety of 
enemies which can be destroyed or avoided, but 
will cost you one life if you get caught. When you

the exit appears and you can move on to the 
question phase. Here you will be asked five

F-1 Spirit (c) Feb 28, 1991 Konami Industry Co. 
  Ltd. / Konami Industry Co. Ltd. 
 
F-1 Spirit is the first portable version of 
  Konami's classic MSX top-down racer. It features 
  three classes of open-wheel cars (which dub as 
  difficulty levels), three game modes (practice, 
  single race and championship) and 25 different 
  tracks all around the world, with some of them 
  only playable on the according championship, 
  from the Japanese Formula 3 to the World F1 
  Grand Prix. On each class, tracks become longer 
  (forcing pit stops), cars faster, and turns 
  change from simple, low angle corners which 
  require no more than a slight trajectory to 
  elbow corners which require some skill to turn 
  without losing speed. 
 
Controls are simple, with the directional button 
steering the car and the B button used to throttle 
the car and A to change between high and low gear.

Felix the Cat (c) 1993 Hudson Soft Company, Ltd. / 
Hudson Soft Company, Ltd. 
 
Felix The Cat is a platformer based on the famous 
cartoon character. 
 
The Professor has kidnapped Kitty, Felix 
girlfriend, trying to exchange her for Felix' 
magic bag. Naturally, Felix is not going to let 
himself be blackmailed, and instead sets out to 
free Kitty. 
 
There are four different types of levels. 
 
1. Typical platforming levels in which Felix 
   has to make his way to the exit while jumping 
   about obstacles and chasms, killing enemies 
   using different weapons. 
 
Swimming levels in which Felix rides a float or on 
the back of a dolphin. 
 
Levels that take place entirely under water. 
 
Flying levels that put Felix in control of 
different flying devices, such as a plane, a 
hot-air balloon or an umbrella. 
 
Throughout all levels, Felix can collect cat 
symbols to improve his weapons. After collecting a 
certain number of cat symbols, milk bottles or 
hearts will appear. Hearts improve Felix' current 
weapon. What types of weapon Felix can use, 
depends on what type of level he is in. There are 
lots of different weapons ranging from a boxing 
glove to motorcycles to tanks to spaceships. All 
weapons that are better than the standard weapon 
have an energy bar that diminishes over time and 
can be refilled by collecting milk bottles. 
Getting hit by an enemy decreases the level of 
Felix' current weapon. If he gets hit while 
carrying the standard weapon, he loses a life. 
 
The Game Boy version plays virtually identically 
to the NES version, but features less levels.

FIFA International Soccer (c) Jan, 1995 Extended 
Play / Malibu Interactive 
 
The game that started the best-selling series 
licensed by football's world governing body, this 
first installment in the long running series used 
a dimetric (colloquially known as "isometric") 
viewpoint, previously unusual in football games 
but quickly imitated by several titles. The 
televisual presentation, one of the unique points 
of the early EA Sports titles, with hosts 
introducing the matches, was another thing making 
the game stand out from a market dominated by 
Sensible Soccer and Kick Off games. 
 
Based on international teams (with fictional 
player names), their abilities in each skill area 
rated out of 10 to give the player an overall 
impression of how good they are. The options 
available follow the standard set: fouls and 
offsides can be toggled on and off, the match 
length can be set, and if the timer operates  
continuously, or only while the ball is in play. 
Gameplay privileges quick runs, short passes and 
blistering shots outside the penalty box, and set 
pieces are controlled by moving a box into the 
target area for the ball, and then passed, lobbed 
or kicked directly. On the tactical side, 
formations can be selected, with 5 different 
strategies also available (although not all of 
these combinations make sense) as can the team 
Coverage - the areas which defenders, midfielders 
and strikers cover.

Final Fantasy Legend II (c) Nov, 1991 Square Co., 
Ltd. / Square Soft, Inc. 
 
The second in the Final Fantasy Legend series 
increases the amount of detail over the original 
in gameplay and graphics. 
 
The major changes are in the character classes and 
party members. Similar to FFL, starting a game of 
Legends II allows you to choose your main 
character from Humans, Monsters, Mutants and a new 
class: Robots. From here, you build your party of 
4 from the same character classes. During gameplay 
special side-characters will join you in battle to 
help defeat certain enemies. 
 
The other improvement is in strategy. In FFL you 
gain experience points after each battle, 
increasing strength, etc. In FFLII, you gain 
different points and abilities depending on how 
you defeated the enemy. If you win by using a 
sword, your strength increases. If you use magic, 
your mana increases. This adds a more strategic 
approach to defeating enemies.

The final (no joke) Final Fantasy Legend title to 
grace the Game Boy, FFLIII tells the story of a 
great flood which destroys cities in the past, 
present and future. 
As you control a party of 4, with a choice of 
human and mutant classes, and travel back and 
forth through time collecting pieces of the great 
ship Talon so as to defeat the enemy that has 
flooded the lands. 
 
The inclusion of a time travel storyline means 
that whatever you do in one time frame can have an 
affect on what happens in another time. Other 
major changes compared to the original 2 in the 
series are the ability to mutate your characters 
further and a change to the upgrade system. 
Items picked up after battle can be attached to 
your mutants or humans to turn them into monsters 
or robots, increasing your parties power and 
abilities. 
And although the original system of obtaning 
experience points after every battle has been 
removed, its replacement allows you to choose 
which magic stone each character can use, so they 
learn that specific magic type and never lose it.

Gameboy Wars (c) May 21, 1991 Intelligent Systems

The second entry in Nintendo's Wars series pits 
two parties against each other: it's the Red Star 
army versus the White Moon army in turn-based 
battles over 16 maps, which, unlike in the 
previous game, are arranged in hexagonal grids. 
 
On each map, the goal is to either destroy all 
enemy forces or capture the enemy's capital city. 
24 different troop types are available, which can 
be given various orders from attacking enemy units 
to supporting friendly ones to besieging or 
capturing enemy cities or installations. Battles 
are shown as small animated sequences. 
 
Building (and repairing) units requires income, 
which is generated by occupying cities or 
production facilities. What units can be 
constructed where depends on the building type: 
factories and cities build land units, airports

Game of Harmony, The (c) 1995 Assembly Line, The / 
Accolade, Inc. 
 
This strategic action puzzle game features 
original gameplay. You control a spacecraft 
situated on a globe which you can rotate and move 
around the screen. You must knock globes into 
others of the same colour, to rid the screen of 
all the globes. The screen has no borders, so 
globes can be pushed off the side of the screen, 
increasing your tactical range. Knocking globes of 
different colors into each other produces smaller 
pods which need to be picked up quickly, giving 
you energy, or they will turn into globes and you 
will have to get rid of them too. Many of the 
globes are linked to other globes (or the ship) 
via string, and the level layouts include barriers 
as obstacles (and ricochet points), making the 
Newtonian physics more complex.

Game & Watch Gallery (c) May, 1997 Nintendo R&D1 / 
Nintendo of America Inc. 
 
The Game & Watch Gallery is Nintendo's first 
portable compilation featuring their popular line 
of original 1980's handheld games, featuring the 
popular "Mr. Game & Watch" himself, as well as 
Mario and friends. 
 
The compilation consists of four popular titles 
from the Game & Watch Series, each with a 
"Classic" and "Modern" version of each game: 
 
1. Octopus: Collects as much treasure as your 
   bag can hold, while avoiding the octopus 
   tentacles that continually swing around you.  
   In the "Modern" version, Mario becomes the 
   diver, and as he collects more treasure, his 
   bag becomes heavier, making it harder to return 
   to the surface.  Mario can also delay the 
   octopus tentacles by throwing treasure at them. 
 
Fire: Position your net to catch the falling 
people jumping from the burning building.  The 
"Modern" version has Mario and Luigi rescuing 
Toad, Yoshi and Donkey Kong Jr. from Princess 
Peach's Castle.  Each falling character has 
different weights and falling patterns. 
 
Manhole: The player must cover the holes to keep 
the continually walking people from falling 
through the manholes and into the sewers.  In the 
"Modern" version, Yoshi must use his tongue to 
keep Mario, Toad and Donkey Kong Jr. from falling 
thought the hole, each character having different 
speeds and patterns. 
 
Oil Panic: The player must collect the dripping 
blobs of oil before they slip past and ruin 
everything.  The "Modern" version has Bowser 
dropping oil blobs at Mario, who has to catch the 
oil and dump it over to Yoshi before the Koopa 
King gets the best of Mario. 
 
Each mode (Classic and Modern) has two 
difficulties: Easy and Hard.  The higher score a 
player gets in each version, new unlockable 
bonuses will become available via the "Gallery 
Corner".  These bonuses include release dates, 
pictures and animations which tell in greater 
detail the history behind Gunpei Yokoi's portable 
creations.

George Foreman's KO Boxing (c) 1992 Beam Software 
Pty., Ltd. / Acclaim Entertainment, Inc. 
 
Featuring heavyweight champion George Foreman, 
this is a boxing simulation where players, taking 
the role of Foreman, go through a series of twelve 
rounds against different boxers to win the 
championship title belt. 
 
Played from an third-person perspective using a 
view from right over the shoulders over the boxer, 
players can move left and right to dodge incoming 
punches, block and throw left and right punches. 
The standard punch is a cross, but by holding the 
Up-key pressed, jabs can also be thrown. 
 
By avoiding punches and hitting them, a superpunch 
often becomes available, inflicting much more 
damage. A fight consists of a maximum of three 
rounds of three minutes each. When a boxer is 
knocked down four times, the match is over 
(technical knock-out). The same happens when a 
boxer goes down three times in a single round 
(regular knock-out). When down, players need to 
press both punch buttons in rapid succession to 
get back to their feet. The screen shows an energy 
meter drained when punches are received. After 
being knocked down and during intermissions, some 
energy is restored. 
 
All versions, except for the Game Boy, can be 
played with two players. A password system is used 
to save the progress.

Ghostbusters II (c) 1990 HAL Laboratory, Inc. / 
Activision, Inc. 
 
Loosely based on the movie of the same name, 
Ghostbusters II sees Virgo the Carpathian appear 
in New York city. He captures Diana's baby and it 
is up to the Ghostbusters to get him back. In 
order to accomplish this, the Ghostbusters: Igon, 
Ray, Peter and Winston, must chase Virgo through 
the courtrooms, the sewers, the apartments, the 
underground and the art museum. 
 
Ghostbusters II is a top-view action game based 
off of New Ghostbusters II (the second 
Ghostbusters II license on NES) but with enough 
differences to be unique. Players begin by 
choosing two of the four ghostbusters, who all 
play the exact same. The first one selected is 
controlled by the player directly and carries a 
proton pack, the second ghostbuster is follows the 
first and carries the ghost trap. The objective of 
each level is to capture a predefined number of 
ghosts before the timer expires. The player moves 
up, down, left and right. One button will fire the 
proton gun directly in front of the first 
ghostbuster, stunning any ghosts. The second 
button will toss the trap directly in front of the 
second ghostbuster, trapping any stunned ghosts. 
While exploring the levels, any of the 2 remaining 
ghostbusters (as well as the ghostbusters' 
accountant Louis) not currently being used will 
occasionally show up. Touching them will provide 
power-ups (and often swap with a selected 
Ghostbuster) including vacuum guns, instant traps 
and invulnerability.

A peaceful nation has been invaded by an enemy 
army, and you must help clear the way for your own 
forces by plane. You must guide your tank to the 
end of each stage by arranging boxes with a hook 
attached to the bottom of your plane, as well as 
by shooting enemy planes and batteries that 
threaten it. The tank will roll forward on its own 
and climb up any wall that is only a single block 
high -- anything taller and it will crash into it 
and turn around, taking damage. If your tank takes 
too much damage, it will be destroyed and the game 
is over. If you get hit, you lose a plane, and if 
you run out of planes, the game will also be over. 
 
There are several special items to help you on 
your way, including a power hook that allows you 
to directly carry the tank, a bomb that can 
destroy all enemies on the screen, and an option 
that makes a second plan follow yours and mimic 
your actions. 
 
The game features ten stages, as well as a 
2-player cooperative mode (two planes) when played

the people fight off the scourge named “Bio-Haz” 
who is consuming this dimension with evil and 
destruction. 
 
This new dimension you find yourself in is not 
terribly unlike the one you came from, with the 
exception that everyone is named after foods or 
food-related items and most of the monsters appear 
to be mutated vegetables and the like. 
 
This RPG breaks from the normal formula in a few 
respects. The battle system does not use any 
menus, switching all commands to simple button 
pushes. A being attack, B for dodge, Start will 
run and the D-Pad is shortcuts to certain spells. 
The combat is also live, in the sense that if you 
take too long to complete your turn, your opponent 
will attack again. 
 
Using a battery-backed save system, the game will 
automatically auto-save after every successful 
battle.

trying to keep from getting eaten, the kebiishi 
digs holes where the aliens will likely travel.

trapped in the hole, you can fill the hole to bury 
it.  If all aliens are buried, the round ends and 
you can proceed to the next round.

Hit the Ice (c) 1992 Taito Corporation / Taito 
America Corporation 
 
Hit the Ice is a fast-paced, high-impact hockey 
game based on the 1990 arcade game from Williams. 
Having more in common with Midway's Arch Rivals 
than any sane hockey simulation, this arena is no 
place for penalties, and no place for wimps. While 
the idea is still to somehow put the puck into the 
opposing team's goal, each team only has three 
players, there is a heavy focus on checking, and 
it is possible to do a "super shot" which is 
strong enough to send the goalie into the net 
along with the puck. 
 
Available are exhibition and tournament modes for 
one or two players. Two players can even team up 
to take on the computer. The TurboGrafx-16 release 
also adds a four-player mode, while the Gameboy 
version adds a "shot race" mode where the player 
must get a certain number of goals as quickly as 
possible.

Your job in this action puzzler is to help 
prehistoric man to evolve by helping them discover 
tools, the wheel, weapons, or even fire. Each 
level in the game will have a given task to help 
in this, and you are allotted a number of 
characters who must accomplish the task. The 
player can switch from person to person while 
moving the characters around each scrolling 
puzzle, and teamwork is essential to success. 
 
Tasks can include finding objects (like a spear) 
on the screen, or trying to reach a specific 
destination which may require the use of objects 
you have discovered so far. Each level has a time 
limit, when time runs out the level can be 
restarted.

Hunt for Red October, The (c) 1991 Beam Software 
Pty., Ltd. / Hi-Tech Expressions, Inc. 
 
Based on the movie of the same name, the Soviet 
Union have been building in secret a Typhoon-class 
submarine with nuclear strike capabilities. This 
war machine has been named the Red October. While 
on its trial run, the captain, Marko Ramius has 
hijacked the submarine along with it's crew. They 
plan to defect to the United States. Naturally, 
such a weapon must not be allowed to fall into 
American plans, and so orders are issued among the 
Soviet forces to destroy the Red October. 
 
You control the Red October during its run for 
freedom. The game plays as an underwater 
sidescroller. The Red October submarine can move 
in any of four directions. The A button fires 
torpedoes horizontally towards the right and the B 
button fires missiles vertically, upwards. 
Additionally, the Caterpillar drive (invisibility) 
may be activated for short periods of time. The 
player may also activate a ECM blast that will 
destroy all nearby offensive weapons. On the 
screen at all times are displays for Armor 
(health) and Power (fuel)

Incredible Crash Dummies, The (c) Nov 05, 1992 
Software Creations Ltd. / LJN, Ltd. 
 
At a time when computer games were being blamed 
for violence, bad language, epilepsy and 
everything else the ‘moral majority’ needed a 
scapegoat for, Virgin gave us: The Road Safety 
Game. Or not, as this is a standard platform game 
with a twist of questionable taste and purpose. 
 
You play a crash test dummy, trying to progress 
through levels filled with hazards such as cars 
and fireballs, within the time limits. Contact 
with each of these loses you a limb, and once you 
have none left, contact means game over. Since the 
character isn’t handicapped by missing limbs in 
any way, in practical terms you can think of these 
as hit points  especially as there are 
screwdrivers to pick up which restore one limb.

Indiana Jones and the Last Crusade (c) Jul, 1994

As in the movie (and the more famous graphic 
adventure), your task is to find the Holy Grail. 
Before this can be done you must find the Cross of 
Coronado, a shield and a diary. 
 
This makes for a four-level arcade adventure 
combining climbs, exploration (with several routes 
through each level, and some traps) and puzzles. 
Indy is armed with his trusty whip to fight off 
foes, but can also get involved in hand-to-hand 
combat. The first level takes place in caves 
underneath Colorado, before you reach a moving 
circus train strewn with traps, a Zeppelin which 
is full of guards and ladders, and then Castle 
Grunwald in Austria.

play that can dramatically increase the score, 
which makes the game very strategic in nature.  
Additionally, when desired, the player can get an

There is also a "construction set" where players

escape and prove his innocence.  Following the 
fight at the top of the Statue of Liberty that 
ended the film, the game continues on with levels

One of many different titles based on Steven 
Spielberg's 1993 dinosaur thriller, the version 
for NES and Game Boy is a top-down action game 
with exploration elements. 
 
Playing as Dr. Alan Grant, the player must work 
through six levels by completing certain 
objectives including rescuing the kids Tim and 
Lex, restoring power, destroying Raptor nests and 
finally getting off the dinosaur-infested island. 
To advance in a level, a number of dinosaur eggs 
scattered over the area must be collected or 
destroyed. This will reveal a passcard used to 
gain entry to buildings, or some other items 
necessary to complete the assignment. The park's 
computer terminals can be used to request hints on 
where to go next. 
 
Naturally, the levels are full of hostile 
dinosaurs. Dr. Grant can fend them off with his 
gun. Several ammunition types are available, 
varying in damage and shooting patterns. Killed 
dinosaurs will always drop the most basic ammo 
type, the others must be found. Next to ammo 
clips, there are boxes with question marks on them 
to be collected. These might include beneficial 
powerups like a health increase, but can also be 
dangerous and reveal a bomb. 
 
Some levels end in boss encounters, including a 
Triceratops stampede and a fight against the 
Tyrannosaurus Rex.

Kaeruno Tameni (c) Sep 14, 1992 Intelligent 
Systems Co., Ltd. / Nintendo Co., Ltd. 
 
Prince Richard and Prince Sablé have been rivals 
since they were young.  When news arrives of a 
princess in a far-off kingdom who requires 
rescuing, Richard dashes off in the hopes of 
saving her before Sablé manages to.  Left to catch 
up, Sablé explores the land, and soon becomes 
cursed, turning into a frog whenever a strange 
bell is heard.  Sablé must remove the curse and 
rescue the princess. 
 
Kaeru No Tame Ni Kane Wa Naru is an 
action-adventure game.  The game plays in two 
modes: a top-down view (where most exploration and 
battle is done), and a side-scrolling view (where 
more puzzle solving is done than battles).  
Battling is not actually performed by the player, 
instead it is all automatic.  If you bump into an 
enemy, you will see a dust cloud appear, and the 
pair will scuffle, with each character's health 
draining.  Whoever loses all their health first 
loses the battle.  Sablé can increase his battle 
advantage by collecting heart containers (to 
increase his life bar), and power ups that 
increase statistics like power and defense. 
 
Another feature of Kaeru No Tame Ni Kane Wa Naru 
is Sablé's ability to transform into a frog at 
certain points in the game.  This allows him to 
access areas that he previously could not.  The 
main goal of the game is to conquer a huge castle, 
however, sections are sealed off until you 
complete parts of the story, allowing you to 
explore it in small parts at a time.

In the distant future, a monopolistic and 
technological corporation called Ultratech 
organizes a fighting tournament known as "Killer 
Instinct". Many fighters answer the challenge to 
participate, including several of Ultratech's 
experimental warriors.  To increase the 
tournament's challenge, Ultratech utilizes a 
technology that can create bridges between 
alternate dimensions, releasing a creature known 
as Eyedol.  Eyedol is a two-headed ancient warrior 
that was imprisoned along with his bitter rival, 
Gargos. Some warriors enter the tournament to seek 
glory or escape.  Other fighters are attempting to 
bring an end to Ultratech's corruption. 
 
Killer Instinct is a Rare developed fighting game 
published by Nintendo (and distributed in the 
arcades by Midway).  Killer Instinct (or "KI" 
among its fanbase) is a 2D fighting game that 
features 3D rendered sprite based graphics. 
Players choose from 10 characters: Orchid, Cinder, 
Jago, Glacius, Fulgore, Riptor, Sabrewulf, Spinal,

Killer Instinct is known for its heavy combo based 
fighting system, allowing players to pull off 
moves that land an insane number of hits on their 
opponent, the highest being the "Ultra Combo".  
The gameplay is also known for its use of combo 
breakers, finishing moves and stage fatalities, 
double energy bars, and dance-music inspired 
techno soundtrack.

King James Bible (c) 1994 Wisdom Tree, Inc. / 
Wisdom Tree, Inc. 
 
This cartridge contains the entire King James 
Version Bible, complete with simple or complex 
word search option, as well as two word games. 
 
The first of the word games is Bible Word Match, 
sort of a Bible-word-themed version of the Milton 
Bradley board game Memory. Words are randomly 
selected from the Bible and hidden in pairs on the 
screen. Move the flashing box to a hidden word and 
press A. The word will be revealed. Now move to 
another hidden word and press A. If the two words 
match, you gain ten points and the words will 
disappear from the screen. If they do not match, 
you lose five points and the words will be covered 
again. After three correct matches in a row, a 
cherry will appear. Capture it to get a thirty 
point bonus. After five correct matches in a row, 
a Boom will appear. Capture it to reveal all words 
briefly. 
 
The other word game is Bible Shepherd, a 
Bible-themed version of Hangman. You have three 
sheep in a pen, the alphabet to select from and a 
word who's letters are hidden, showing only blank 
spaces. Move your cursor to a letter and press A. 
If the letter is not in the word, the sheep will 
stop moving. Select an incorrect letter again and 
one of the sheep will jump out of the pen. If you 
select a correct letter, its location(s) will be 
revealed in the word and, if you have sheep 
outside the pen, one will jump back in. You get 
one hundred points for each correct guessed word 
plus ten points for any sheep in the pen when the 
word is guessed correctly. If all three sheep jump 
from the pen before you can reveal the word, you 
lose.

The first sequel in the King of Fighters series 
picks up a year after the end of the first 
tournament. Once again, fighters from all over the

year, it appears that the notorious criminal Rugal

The King of Fighters '95 introduces Kyo Kusanagi's 
rival Iori Yagami, and firmly places Kyo as the 
main character for the rest of the series. The 
gameplay of The King of Fighters '95 is 
essentially unchanged from the previous title,

Kirby's Pinball Land is a game of pinball based on 
the Kirby series of games, with Kirby as the ball. 
 In the game you have to help Kirby defeat King 
Dedede and the three bosses who each guard one of 
the Pinball Lands. 
 
The game is divided into three tables or Pinball 
Lands, each consisting of four screens, three 
ordinary screens, and a boss screen  If you fall 
off the bottom of the lowest one, you lose a life, 
unless you press A at the right moment to activate 
the springboard, which becomes harder each time.  
Each screen has a variety of things to do.  The 
middle screen will give access to some sort of 
bonus game, where you must try to get as many 
points as you can, and can add to your bonus and 
bonus multiplier.  The bonus is added to your 
score when you lose a life, as in ordinary 
pinball. 
 
The aim is to defeat each boss.  To get to the 
boss you must perform a task on the top ordinary 
screen.  The bosses themselves must be defeated by 
firing Kirby at them, but they will try to stop 
you, sometimes by temporarily de-activating one or 
both of the flippers.  If you defeat the boss on 
each table, you face Kind Dedede himself.

Kirby's Star Stacker (c) Apr, 1997 HAL Laboratory, 
Inc. / Nintendo of America Inc. 
 
Kirby's Star Stacker is a Tetris-like puzzle game. 
 There are varying modes of play, such as Time 
Trial, Challenge and Story Mode, but the basic 
idea of play is the same: you must sandwich Star 
Blocks between two like Friend Blocks, either 
horizontally or vertically.  The Friend Blocks and 
any Star Blocks in-between are then removed from 
play.  Similar to Tetris, sets of blocks fall into 
the bin that contain any two of the following 
types: 
 
Star Blocks: The most important block, as all of 
the game types rely on it. Sandwich these blocks 
between two Friend Blocks either horizontally or 
vertically, and they will be cleared.  The more 
stars you clear, the higher the score. 
 
Friend Blocks: These blocks have pictures of 
Kirby's friends - Rick the Hamster, Kine the Fish, 
and Coo the Owl (all from Kirby's Dream Land 2) - 
on them. Match two of each to clear them from the 
screen.  Any Star Blocks between the two character 
blocks will also be cleared. 
 
Bomb Blocks: Sandwich a Bomb Block in between two 
Friend Blocks, and the bomb will explode, removing 
all blocks in the same row. 
 
Hard Blocks: You have to clear these blocks twice 
to clear them from the screen. Clear them once and 
they transform into an ordinary Star Block, and 
then can be removed in the normal way. 
 
The game also features a clever 'chain' system 
that rewards you for clearing blocks which then 
clear other blocks.  If you clear two or more 
blocks in this manner, then you'll be rewarded 
with Kirby raining down that amount of Stars, 
which can fill in gaps, which in turn could 
complete a row and allow it to chain even further!

divisions of racing through success on 60 
racetracks across America. In each division there 
are 20 rival racers, up to 3 of which compete in 
each race at a time. 
 
The races also feature lots of local drivers (who 
can take crucial positions away from you and the 
other championship drivers), Sunday drivers going 
at normal speed, and police. before each race you 
will be told of the quality of the locals and the 
likelihood of police presence. 
 
When police are in the area, speeding beyond 110 
Km/h could see you branded as an offender, at 
which point the police will try to ram you off the 
road, Chase H.Q.-style. You can attempt to reach 
the end of the race despite this damage (which 
eventually hampers your speed), or simply pull 
over and accept a fine and the loss of race 
points. If the police subsequently stop you, the 
fine is heavier. 
 
Each race costs money to enter, and your earnings 
can be boosted by betting on the results with the 
other championship drivers. If one of you wins, 
each driver gives you either the amount they bet 
or the amount you bet, whichever is lower

Lawnmower Man, The (c) 1993 Sales Curve Ltd., The 
/ Time Warner Interactive, Inc. 
 
The Lawnmower Man is the game based on the 1992 
movie of the same name (itself loosely based on a 
Stephen King short story)  starring pre-Bond fame 
Pierce Brosnan as Dr. Lawrence Angelo, a scientist 
working for Virtual Space Industries in "Project 
5", a secret research that attempts to increase 
the intelligence of primates using psychotropic 
drugs and VR training. 
 
With his reluctance to aim the research to 
military purpose, after one of the chimps escapes 
and shoots a guard in the process he is given a 
forced vacation, and while taking notes on the 
need for experiment with a human subject, he 
notices Jobe Smith (Jeff Fahey), a simpleton who 
makes his living on odd jobs such as mowing the 
grass (hence, the title role). The first 
experiments quickly increase Jobe's intelligence, 
and while after an accident Angelo stopped the 
experiments, The Shop, a secret agency overviewing 
Project 5, reinserted the drugs responsible for 
violent behaviour into the program and sped up the 
treatment. As Jobe starts to develop telekinetic 
powers, he starts to take revenge on those who 
abused him before he started the treatments, and 
plots to take over all computers in the world. 
 
While the CD version of the game (PC, Mega CD) is 
an interactive movie, both cartridge versions are 
platformers, the player taking control of Dr. 
Angelo or Carla Parkette (mother of Jobe's best 
friend) in typical side-scrolling shooting action. 
The player can collect better weapons or data 
discs, which after collecting a number of them 
allow to morph into the Virtual Suit, which gives 
protection against a first hit. The player visits 
several locations seen in the movie, such as the 
gas pump and the VSI headquarters. 
 
The twists of the game are true-3D level 
connectors, based on the CG sequences of the 
movie, usually all involving avoiding obstacles 
(and the occasional shooting) at high speed in the 
VR world. There are four different (Virtual World, 
Cyber War, Cyber Run and Cyber Tube), each taking 
a slightly different approach (Virtual World is 
seen in first person, the objective being dodging 
obstacles such as trees and archs and reach the 
exit, Cyber War similar to Virtual World but with 
some shooting stops, Cyber Run is seen in third

Legend of Prince Valiant, The (c) 1992 
 
Different from the NES game of the same name. In 
the game the player takes on the role of the 
legendary Prince Valiant licensed from the cartoon 
series of the same name which is in turn based on 
the comic series Prince Valiant. Prince Valiant 
must lead Arthur's armies against the Tyrant 
Cynan. The goal is to capture all his castles or 
defeat all his armies. 
 
A giant over-map shows the world and is divided in 
tiles. Each tiles has different terrain and shows 
whether units or castles are present in a tile. 
Tiles are either white or gray depending on 
whether Arthur or Cynan controls it. 
 
Characters on the map can be directly controlled 
after being selected. This happens in a top-down 
view similar to The Legend of Zelda. Characters 
can attack and jump. Each character has different 
attacks. Items can be collected and the player can 
move freely between tiles. Moving through tiles 
that are occupied by the enemy conquers those 
territories, but the enemy can take them back at 
any time by moving through them again. If two 
enemy units meet on the same tile, combat ensues. 
In real time the player must try to defeat the AI 
opponent. This is done through dodging his attack 
and trying to land a blow. To conquer a castle all 
enemies including those in adjacent tiles must be 
defeated. 
 
It is also possible to find and collect items in 
the direct control mode. Items serve as power-ups 
that for example make the player faster or restore 
health points.The player can return to a castle at 
any time to heal completely. 
 
The player can select the size of the world to 
increase or decrease the game's length. 
Additionally he or she and change the difficulty 
of the AI player (Cynan) and select a handicap for 
himself. It is also possible to play against 
another player.

Legend of Zelda, The - Link's Awakening (c) Aug, 
1993 Nintendo EAD / Nintendo of America Inc. 
 
The fourth game in the Zelda series although it 
does not take place in Hyrule. After being 
attacked at sea, Link's ship sinks, and he finds 
himself stranded on Koholint Island. He awakens to 
see a beautiful woman looking down at him. He soon 
learns the island has a giant egg on top of a 
mountain that the Wind Fish inhabits deep inside. 
Link is told to "awaken the wind fish and all will 
be answered," so Link sets out on another quest. 
 
Play is similar to the SNES game with a top down 
perspective. Link must go onto each of the 7 
temples to retrieve a musical instrument that will 
help awaken the Wind Fish. Along the way, Link 
must search the land and uncover hidden treasures 
and items that will allow him to progress on his 
journey. With new items, he can open up new 
passages that will take him even farther on his 
quest and allow him to enter new areas that were 
inaccessible before. Link can attack his enemies 
with his sword or use items he finds during his 
quest to help him. Guarding every instrument is a 
temple boss, which must be defeated if Link is to 
awaken the Wind Fish.

$bio
 
 
Lemmings 2 - The Tribes (c) 1994 DMA Design 
Limited / Psygnosis Limited 
 
The sequel to one of the most famous games ever 
now has a much more significant plot. The Lemmings 
have split into 12 distinct tribes, each of which 
has their own landscape and their own cultural 
identity - they include Egyptian, Circus and 
Highland. However, Lemming Island is now in 
danger, and you must complete 10 levels for each 
tribe in order for them to reunite and reassemble 
the Talisman from the 12 pieces. 
 
Across the 120 levels there are over 60 skills, 
although no more than 10 are in use on each 
screen. The Classic tribe has the ones form the 
original and is perhaps the best option for 
first-time players. 
 
The others range from digging methods such as a 
scooper (diagonally downwards) and club basher 
(horizontal), building skills such as a planter 
(takes time to produce the desired raise to the 
landscape) and a sand pourer, and various methods 
of movement including a Pole-Vaulter and a Skater 
(the only Lemmings who can cross ice). Some of 
these are only subtly different to others, and 
their exact uses are unclear, but there are 4 
Trainer levels where you can select any 
combination of skills and experiment. 
 
Unlike the first game, you are rewarded for saving 
as many Lemmings as possible, rather than simply 
passing or failing. The ultimate aim is to save 
all 60 Lemmings through all levels, thereby 
earning a Gold Medal for that tribe - Silver and 
Bronze are also on offer. You can also go back 
over levels in the hope of saving more Lems. 
 
Because there are 12 tribes, and you can switch 
between them at any point, you have to be stuck 12 
times in order to be unable to progress. The game 
saves your progress rather than using passwords as 
in the first game.

Lock 'N Chase (c) Jul, 1990 Data East Corporation 
/ SunSoft 
 
Lock 'n' Chase is an arcade action game similar to 
Pac-Man. You play a thief who has to rob banks. 
Each bank is a different maze, and there are 
policemen who chase you. You need to collect all 
of the gold coins and avoid the police officers. 
 
Located throughout the maze are numerous doors. As 
you run through the maze, you have the ability to 
temporarily close a door in an attempt to block 
the police. You can only close maximum of two 
doors at a time, so you can even trap a police 
officer between two closed doors. Closed doors 
automatically open again after a short amount of 
time. 
 
As the stages progress, extra items and hazards 
are introduced. There are sliding doors that open 
and close slowly, question marks that toggle 
police officers on and off, alarm clocks that wake 
up sleeping police officers, invisible 
passageways, teleporter doors etc. 
 
Occasionally a bonus item will appear in the maze, 
such as a cash bag that temporary stuns all police 
officers, and a diamond which makes you temporary 
invincible. Also, after clearing all stages in a 
bank you get to play a bonus game. You play a slot 
machine to earn extra lives, and each collected 
diamond is worth one try.

Loopz (c) Mar, 1991 Audiogenic Software Ltd. / 
Mindscape, Inc. 
 
A puzzle game where the main goal is to make 
loops! Random pieces are presented over a board, 
including simple lines and corners as well as S 
bends and other warped shapes, of varying sizes. 
It is up to the player to link them up in a loop 
form, then moving on to the next level. Pieces can 
be placed on any empty space on the grid, and 
rotated into one of the four main compass 
directions. 
 
Any pieces which are not part of the finished loop 
when a level is completed are left on the screen, 
so there is value in playing towards 2 distinct 
loops, to ensure that you have options depending 
on which pieces are drawn - unlike Pipe Dream 
there are no clues as to which pieces are coming 
next. 
 
Three play modes are available, two of which can 
be played with two players. Game A is freestyle - 
simply make loops, gaining extra points for size 
and style. 
 
Game B is about unlocking bonus boards of the game 
by reaching a certain score. and uses a bonus 
multiplier method depending on loop difficulty. 
 
The third mode of play begins with an already made 
loop and then removes random pieces of it, so the 
player has to put them back in when they appear 
again. It is essentially a memory test and logic 
puzzle of fitting the pieces back as one remembers 
- although placing a piece where it seems to fit 
is also often effective.

mostly consists of running, jumping and climbing 
through the large platform-like levels. However, 
in the jungles and caves of the island, many 
enemies await: Both various dinosaur species, 
including Tyrannosaurus Rex and Velociraptor, and 
human enemies, employees of InGen's rival BioSyn.

Lunar Lander (c) Sep 21, 1990 Pack-In-Video Co., 
Ltd / Pack-In-Video Co., Ltd 
 
Lunar Lander is a space exploration game based 
around three separate stages: 
 
Lift-off: Fly your space shuttle into outer space 
by following the guidance arrows displayed on the 
screen. If you don't centre the shuttle according 
to the signs, your progress is slowed down and you 
will run out of fuel before leaving Earth's 
gravitation. You must also keep an eye on your 
compressor, since it must be constantly at a high 
level for the rockets to boost sufficiently. 
Feeding the compressor too much will deplete your 
fuel, though, so everything must be balanced for 
the lift-off to be successful. 
 
Landing: This stage is very similar to the old 
Lunar Lander type of game that was popular in the 
early eighties. From a map of the moon, you select 
one of eight landing sites. On the landing screen, 
you must carefully guide your lander through the 
cave-like craters to the landing pads. Different 
landing pads are worth different amounts of 
points, according to level of difficulty. 
Preserving your lander's fuel will also give bonus 
points. Unlike most typical Lander games, your 
craft has no rockets for going left or right – 
instead you must rotate your lander and ignite the 
single landing rocket in order to adjust your 
angle. There are also meteorites to watch out for. 
 
Exploration: Once you have landed, an astronaut 
steps out on the surface, armed with a metal 
detector. Your task here is to find five different 
kinds of metal ore and bring them to the lander 
before you run out of air or time. The metal 
detector beeps with different frequencies 
according to your vicinity to a piece of metal. If 
there is a constant beep, you drill for the metal. 
If you drill elsewhere, you may find flowers that 
replenish your air supply. To complicate things, 
the moon surface is filled with robots that try to 
hunt you down. Contact with a robot wears down 
your air supply. 
 
After you have landed and explored all eight 
areas, your mission is completed and you proceed 
to the next one, which is more of the same.

Mega Man is the robot creation of Dr. Light, whose

As Mega Man, you run and jump through futuristic 
levels, shooting baddies with your blaster, and 
defeat each of Dr. Wily's Robot Masters. When you 
defeat them, you can take their ability as your 
own, which can provide an advantage against other 
types of evil robots. 
 
In this Game Boy version, Mega Man must fight 
against Ice Man, Electric Man, Cut Man, and Fire 
Man. After he defeats those four he battles Quick 
Man, Heat Man, Bubble Man, and Flash Man. And 
after that, there's Dr. Wily's Space Node. That

Megaman II (c) Feb, 1992 Capcom Co., Ltd. / Capcom

Dr. Wily has broken into the Chronos Institute 
    and stolen a machine called Time Skimmer. 
    According to Dr. Light's calculations, he has 
    used the machine to travel roughly 37,426 
    years into the future. This can mean nothing 
    good and so Mega Man, along with his dog Rush, 
    sets out to find out more about Dr. Wily's 
    plans. 
 
Mega Man II follows the same formula as its 
predecessors, meaning the player has to complete a 
number of side-scrolling, platforming levels that 
are guarded by different bosses. Mega Man can only 
shoot left or right, but defeating a boss rewards 
him with a new weapon. Sometimes he will also find 
upgrades for Rush, which enable him to use Rush as 
a trampoline, a submarine or a jet. 
 
While Mega Man II is not a conversion, the first 
four stages look and play very similar to some 
levels of Mega Man 2 for the NES. Likewise, levels 
five to eight resemble some levels of Mega Man 3. 
The bosses of the first eight stages are also old 
familiars from Mega Man 2 and 3.

    incredible power generated to fuel his latest 
    diabolical robot creation!  Of course, only 
    Mega Man can stop him! 
 
Mega Man III follows the tradition of the previous 
Game Boy games - you must run, jump and blast your 
way through four boss worlds.  After defeating the 
four bosses, you will encounter an intermission 
level.  Once this level is beaten, you face four 
more bosses, then move on to the final showdown 
with Dr. Wily.  This is the first Game Boy Mega 
Man title to introduce the Mega Buster from Mega 
Man 4 for the NES.  If you hold down the B Button,

from Mega Man 4.  In addition to this, there is a 
powerful Game Boy exclusive boss called Punk, who

going to conquer the Earth! Mega Man attempts to 
fight off this new foe, but is quickly beaten by 
the StarDroid's far superior firepower. 
 
Later, Mega Man awakens to find Dr. Light standing 
over him, telling him that the StarDroids have 
almost taken over the world. But thankfully he was 
quickly able to examine both their firepower and 
their structures, and was able to modify Mega 
Man's weapon system into something much more 
powerful. Mega Man tries this new weapon, and 
finds that he can now fire his whole fist! Dr. 
Light dubs this new weapon the "Mega Arm"! 
 
Now, armed with the Mega Arm, and a new companion, 
the robotic cat Tango, Mega Man must destroy the 
StarDroids and save the planet while he can! The 
ultimate battle for the Earth begins!

Mickey Mouse (c) May 09, 1989 Kotobuki System Co., 
Ltd. / Kotobuki System Co., Ltd. 
 
In this game your quest is to take Mickey Mouse 
through several dungeons, and mostly avoid your 
enemies. 
 
The game is somewhat more a puzzle game than a 
plat-former. You are to get a number of keys to 
reach the exit, and the paths are always reached 
by tricking your opponents into either being shot 
or just stand away for you to walk past during the 
time you need it. Ammo is always very limited and 
consists of arrows and bombs, in the fashion that 
you on some levels use arrows and on some bombs. 
 
The story is simple and consists of you, as Mickey 
Mouse, must save Minnie from an evil warlock.

Mickey's Ultimate Challenge (c) May, 1994 Designer 
Software|WayForward Technologies / Hi-Tech 
Expressions, Inc. 
 
One night, as Mickey (or Minnie) lay in bed 
reading a book of fairy tales, he started to 
wonder how it would be to live in a far off land, 
in a magic castle. As he fell asleep, he woke up 
in the Kingdom of Beanwick, which is constantly 
tormented by earthquakes. Then, he offers his help 
to solve the mystery behind those earthquakes. 
 
Mickey's Ultimate Challenge is a puzzle game in 
which the player chooses either Mickey or Minnie 
to play with. They'll find five characters from 
the Disney's universe in the kingdom, and will be 
prompted to help them in several tasks. 
 
Each task is a different puzzle, given by a 
specific character. Daisy, for instance, will ask 
help to clean the castle's paintings hanging on a 
wall. The task is in fact a memory game, where 
Mickey or Minnie must clean the pictures matching 
pairs. After completing one task, they'll receive 
a gift. 
 
After completing all tasks, Mickey or Minnie must 
trade the gifts they won with the right 
characters. For instance, after finishing Goofy's 
task, they will receive his hammer. The player 
must then guess who among the other characters 
would like to receive that hammer. 
 
Giving the right items to the right characters 
will allow Mickey or Minnie access to the last 
puzzle and character.

Micro Machines (c) Jan, 1995 Ocean Software Ltd. / 
Ocean Software Ltd. 
 
If you're bored of racing Formula 1 cars, rally 
cars or MotoGP bikes in their natural habitats, 
the Micro Machines series could be for you. It 
involves racing miniatures representing particular 
vehicle types across a particular terrain found 
around the house. The Sports Cars race on the 
desktop, 4x4s in the sandpit, Formula 1 cars on a 
snooker table, and so on. 
 
These levels were packed with variation. The 
Snooker tables has the track painted on, although 
this is open to deviation (as are most levels), 
and had you racing through the pockets and across 
the rim of the table. Tanks raced as well, with 
the chance of shooting out your opponent if they 
got directly in front of you. The desktop levels 
include binders to jump across, pencil-sharpeners 
to avoid, and lots of visual jokes in the open 
homework. 
 
Viewed from overhead with small graphics, the 
races include up to 4 cars. In one player 
challenge mode you race through the 21 tracks in a 
set order, selecting your 3 opponents as you go 
along (adding a fair amount of strategy - ideally 
you should aim to eliminate the better CPU cars 
early on), eliminating one after every third race 
(assuming that you can finish in the top 2 of a 
race within your 3 lives). If you win 3 races in a 
row without using a continue you get a time-trial 
race which can earn you an extra life. 
 
The real innovation of the game was in the 
multiplayer modes. You started with 4 points each, 
and when one car gets far enough ahead to force 
the other car off-screen, the slider moves in 
their favour. Once it reached the end (which 
involved beating them 4 times more than they beat 
you) you win the level, although if 3 laps were 
completed, the person leading at that point is 
declared the winner - with a sudden death play off 
if scores are level. 9 of the tracks are available 
in this mode, although you can also play this Head 
to Head system as a 1-player game across all the 
tracks.

Mighty Morphin Power Rangers - The Movie (c) 1995 
Tom Create Co., Ltd. / Bandai America, Inc. 
 
This game is loosely based off of the movie of the 
same name, where the player can take control of 
either the Yellow, Black, Pink, Blue, Red or White 
Ranger in a side-scrolling beat-em-up in an 
attempt to stop the evil Ivan Ooze who is trying 
to control the universe. 
 
There are six different levels to play in each 
with their own standard obstacles and enemies, 
mid-level bosses and of course end bosses that 
range from Mordant, Lord Zedd to Ivan Ooze 
himself.  There are no weapons that can be used, 
instead the player must rely on kicks and punches 
to dispatch enemies and pick up health items left 
behind. 
 
Additionally, the Yellow, Black, Pink Rangers are 
extremely fast and can jump into higher areas but 
are more weaker than Blue, Red, White Rangers who 
are much stronger, but lack the speed and jumping 
abilities of the other Rangers.  Players can 
refill their health by picking up heart icons and 
power icons to increase their morphing meter.  
Once filled, the morphing meter will increase the 
Rangers power, attack capabilities, speed and 
jumping abilities.

Minesweeper (c) Dec 13, 1991 Arc System Works Co., 
Ltd. / Pack-In-Video Co., Ltd 
 
Minesweeper is a minesweeping game, just like the 
one included in every copy of Microsoft Windows 
since ancient times. On a grid, you click in a 
cell and hope that it is not occupied with a mine. 
If it isn't, that cell is filled with a number, 
which indicates how many mines there are in 
adjacent cells. Using logical thinking, looking at 
the relations between different number cells, you 
can conclude which cells contain a mine and mark 
them as such. Once all cells are revealed, you 
progress to the next minefield. 
 
Three main game modes are available, 
differentiated by the size of the minefield: 9x7, 
12x12 and 18x14. Clearing a minefield takes you to 
another one of the same size, but with more bombs 
to clear. 
 
A second mode is a mission mode, where you are 
presented with 10 minefields each in 7 locations 
around the world. The first ones are very small, 
only 4x4, growing larger and larger from then on. 
What is different about the mission mode is that a 
few cells in the minefield are revealed from the 
start, putting your ability of deduction at test. 
 
The final mode allows you to construct a minefield 
of your own, by inputting parametres of size and 
amount of bombs. The game can also be played by 
two players via a link cable.

Mini Putt is a miniature golf game that offers 4 
courses, Deluxe, Classic, Traditional and 
Challenge. Up to 4 players can either play a game 
or practice any hole on any course. Each course 
offers its own difficulty level. Deluxe and 
Challenge have difficult hills and course layouts. 
The Challenge being the more difficult course. The 
Classic offers animated bridges and other 
obstacles. The traditional is your standard 
miniature golf course which requires well placed 
bank shots. 
 
To make a shot, using the joystick, move the 
crosshair in the approximate direction and 
distance where you wish the ball to go. When you 
are ready to shoot, hit the fire button. You will 
notice the level rise in the power bar. When the 
bar reaches the desired distance, press the fire 
button again. When you release the fire button, 
the bar starts to move back down. The mark where 
you stopped the bar moving indicates the power 
with which you hit the ball. When the bar reaches 
the bottom of the power bar, it moves horizontally 
on the accuracy bar. In the middle of the accuracy 
bar is the center line. Too much to the left of 
center, it pulls to the left. Too much to the 
right of center, it pulls to the right. Press the 
fire button at the right moment to hit the ball. 
If the course proves to be too tough, visit the 
Practice course option. Not all of us can be a 
pro.

Muddy Mole's wife and seven kids have been 
kidnapped by the evil farmer, Jinbei!  It's up to 
you to help Muddy solve the many puzzles of Jinbei 
Land.  Snatch all of Jinbei's cabbages in every 
level, and if you get stuck, dig underground and 
create your own secret underground paths.  A word 
of warning, however - Jinbei has got his best 
goons guarding your family, so you'd better watch 
out! 
 
Mole Mania plays from an overhead perspective.  
Although in each room you have to destroy all the 
foes to progress, the game is much more 
puzzle-oriented than it is towards action.  It is 
quite common in later levels to get yourself 
'stuck', which can be fixed by leaving and 
returning to the screen to reset the puzzle.  One 
of the game's clever 'hooks' is that players can 
dig underground in each stage to find a completely 
different map than they do above ground, which can 
be used to get through otherwise impassable 
terrain. 
 
The game also features a two player mode, where 
one player is Muddy, and the other is Jinbei.  
Muddy must swipe as many cabbages as possible, and 
Jinbei must stop him.  At the end of the round, 
players swap roles, and then the player who got 
the most cabbages wins.

Money Puzzle Exchanger is a puzzle game similar to 
Magical Drop only with coins. It was originally 
created by FACE and released for the Neo Geo 
arcade cabinets. 
 
You can move the mini character at the bottom of 
the screen left or right, grab coins and drop them 
somewhere else. There are six types of coins: 1, 
5, 10, 50, 100 and 500. The goal is to form 
connecting groups of coins. Coins are combined 
(vertically and/or horizontally) to form higher 
valued coins. For example, if you put five 1 coins 
together, they will disappear and form one 5 coin. 
Two 5's make one 10, five 10's make one 50 etc. 
Two 500 coins put together just disappear and give 
you 1000 points. 
 
The game is lost when coins reach the bottom of 
the playing area. You can make chain reactions to 
launch attacks to the other player in vs-mode, or 
just for bonus points in single player.

Planet, bans all music and declares himself king. 
Max, a monster rock musician decides to fight 
back. In order to defeat the evil monarch, he 
enlists in the training course at the Mega Hero 
Academy. 
 
Monster Max is a surreal isometric adventure by 
the same duo that created the 8-bit classic Head 
Over Heels. Not surprisingly it is very similar to 
that game in terms of control and general design, 
and almost identical graphically. The character 
moves on a bizarre landscape, where he has to 
collect and use objects (with either the A or B 
button) to accomplish mission objectives. The game 
starts on a training academy that serves as the 
mission hub. Each mission has as an entrance with 
a terminal and a door. By touching the terminal 
with the character, the mission objective and 
reward is displayed on the screen. The missions 
available can be played in any order, but Max has 
to pay a fee to access other levels with more 
advanced missions. On the top left of the screen 
there is a counter for the lucky stars collected. 
Lucky stars allow the character to touch dangerous 
objects once without suffering damage. Besides 
that are several hearts representing the number of 
lives. On the top right is the inventory display, 
showing the two objects assigned to the buttons. 
Hitting START while on a mission brings up a map, 
while pressing SELECT displays a menu with options 
and the password at the bottom of the screen. 
 
The game is far larger than previous isometric 
adventures like Knight Lore, with over 600 more 
detailed locations (the double of Head Over 
Heels). There is a password system to save 
progress.

Mortal Kombat (c) Sep, 1993 Midway Games, Inc. /

Five Hundred years ago, an ancient and well 
respected Shaolin fighting tournament, held every 
50 years, was corrupted by an evil and elderly 
sorcerer by the name of Shang Tsung.  Shang was 
accompanied by Prince Goro, a warrior of the 
Shokan race (a four armed half-human/half-dragon). 
Knowing that if ten tournaments in a row were won 
by the Outworld champion, the Earth Realm would be 
conquered by evil and fall into darkness, Shang 
entered Goro in the tournament and had him defeat 
the great Kung Lao. Goro has been  reigning 
supreme as the undefeated fighting champion for 
five hundred years now. As the last tournament 
required draws near, Raiden, Thunder God and 
protector of the Earth Realm, enacts a plan to tip 
the scales in the humans favor, Seven fighters 
step into the arena on Shang Tsung's mysterious 
island: Shaolin warrior Liu Kang, Special Forces 
operative Sonya Blade, the mercenary thug Kano, 
fame-seeking actor Johnny Cage, the ice wielding 
Lin Kuei warrior Sub-Zero and his undead adversary 
Scorpion, and Raiden himself. 
 
Mortal Kombat is a side-scrolling 1 on 1 fighting 
game. Fighting is set as one on one kombat, 
allowing each player to perform a variety of 
punches, kicks, and special moves in order to 
defeat their opponent.  When the opponent faces 
their second round loss, the winner can perform a 
finishing move called a "Fatality" on the loser.  
The Fatality is a move unique to each fighter that 
graphically kills the loser in a blood-soaked 
finale. 
 
Mortal Kombat began its life as a 2-player arcade 
title. It is notable for its use of digitized 
actors to represent the game's fighters, as well 
as its use of copious amounts of blood during 
gameplay.

Shao Kahn has won. The Earthrealm is no more. In 
order to revive his Queen Sindel, the emperor Shao 
Kahn used the Outworld Tournament from Mortal 
Kombat 2 as a diversion while his Shadow Priests 
revive his fallen Queen on Earth. Once enacted, 
the dimensional bridge between the two realms 
connects, allowing Kahn's extermination squads to 
invade and destroy Earth, and enslave the 
population's souls. 
 
A small team of Raiden's "Chosen Warriors" 
survives the attack: Mortal Kombat champion Liu 
Kang and his ally Kung Lao, Special Forces agents 
Sonya Blade and Jax, the shaman Nightwolf, the 
riot cop Stryker, the nomadic Kabal, and former 
Lin Kuei warrior Sub-Zero, who has gone rogue from 
his clan. Facing the warriors are the mercenary 
Kano, cyber-ninjas Smoke, Sektor and Cyrax, 
Sheeva, a female Shokan, the sorcerer Shang Tsung, 
and Queen Sindel herself. 
 
Mortal Kombat 3 brings new elements to the 2D 
fighting series: multi-level playfields, 
"Dial-A-Combo" attacks, a "Run" button to speed up 
the battles, and "Vs." codes, which unlock new 
powers and abilities once both players enter a 
code sequence in pre-match-up screens. Also 
included are more stage fatalities and finishing 
moves as each warrior attempts to go one-on-one 
with the Centaurian enforcer Motaro, and Shao Kahn 
himself. 
 
Mortal Kombat 3 is the last traditional one-on-one 
fighting game game in the series to feature 
motion-captured digitized graphics for its 
kombatants, and introduces online network play to 
the PC version.

Motocross Maniacs (c) Jan, 1990 Konami Corporation 
/ Ultra Software Corporation 
 
Motocross Maniacs is a side-scrolling racing game 
with extremely perilous courses. You maneuver your 
rider through many jumps, loops, and mud hazards 
to achieve a record time. To assist you there are 
several power ups that give you more time to race, 
more nitro boosts, and more top speed. 
 
The main game is a solo affair. You attempt to 
complete the course before time runs out. You can 
also race one-on-one against the computer or 
against a friend via the link cable.

Mr. Chin's Gourmet Paradise (c) Oct, 1990 
    Romstar Incorporated / Romstar Incorporated 
 
Mr. Chin is hungry!  Help him eat his favorite 
    snack, the delectable peach, by using laser 
    emitting bowls to trap enemies and making them 
    safe to chomp up.   As Mr. Chin, you can drop 
    bowls on the ground with the B Button.  If you 
    place one bowl on the left and one on the 
    right, a laser will fire between the two 
    bowls, and any enemies will be caught between, 
    transforming into peaches.  Mr. Chin can then 
    gobble up the peaches - if he grabs more in a 
    row, their value increases (Mr. Chin's score 
    is measured in calories).  When Mr. Chin eats 
    all the enemies on-screen, more quickly take 
    their place.  Gobble them all up, and when 
    there are no more enemies in the level, you 
    can progress to the next one. 
 
Enemies in the levels can walk on thin line paths, 
but Mr. Chin will fall through these - he can only 
walk on bricks.  Mr. Chin can also smash the 
bricks by punching them from underneath - 
sometimes this will reveal a power up, such as 
invincibility and the ability to turn all foes 
into peaches instantly.

numerous bad guys out to get him! Mr. Do can 
defend himself from the badguys in two ways: first 
he can push the apples located throughout the 
playfield on top of the enemies and crush them. 
Secondly, Mr. Do is armed with a power ball. This 
can be thrown to destroy an enemy. Mr. Do has only 
one power ball, though, so he will need to wait 
for it to return to him before it can be used 
again. From time to time an alpha monster will 
appear on the screen bearing one of the letters in

alpha monster you earn that letter

Ms. Pac-Man (c) Oct, 1993 General Computer 
    Corporation|Midway / Namco Hometek Inc. 
 
In 1982, a sequel to the  incredibly popular 
Pac-Man was introduced in the form of his 
girlfriend, Ms. Pac-Man.  This sequel continued on 
the "eat the dots/avoid the ghosts" gameplay of 
the original game, but added new features to keep 
the title fresh. 
 
Like her boyfriend, Ms. Pac-Man attempts to clear 
four various and challenging mazes filled with 
dots and ever-moving bouncing fruit  while 
avoiding Inky, Blinky, Pinky and Sue, each with 
their own personalities and tactics.  One touch 
from any of these ghosts means a loss of life for 
Ms. Pac-Man. 
 
Ms. Pac-Man can turn the tables on her 
    pursuers by eating one of the four Energizers 
    located within the maze. During this time, the 
    ghosts turn blue, and Ms. Pac-Man can eat them 
    for bonus points (ranging from 200, 400, 800 
    and 1600, progressively). The Energizer power 
    only lasts for a limited amount of time, as 
    the ghost's eyes float back to their center 
    box, and regenerate to chase after Ms. Pac-Man 
    again. 
 
Survive a few rounds of gameplay, and the player 
will be treated to humorous intermissions showing 
the growing romantic relationship between Pac-Man 
and Ms. Pac-Man, leading all the way up to the 
arrival of "Junior".

Mysterium (c) Jul, 1991 Asmik Ace Entertainment, 
Inc. / Asmik Ace Entertainment, Inc. 
 
As a alchemist you must solve a set of mazes to 
prove your worth. 
 
To solve the mazes you must transform the items 
which are found in the maze into something more 
useful. For example, a piece of iron turns in a 
glass key when dropped in a pool of fire. Thus, if 
you want to pass a glass door, you have to find a 
pool of fire and a piece of iron. These 
transformations are not random, but sometimes 
require multiple stages. If you keep good notes, 
you'll find out all possible transformations. 
 
The make it all a little bit more interesting, 
there are monsters inhibiting the maze. That 
problem is easily solved by transforming something 
into a decent weapon.

Like many of Ocean's games Navy Seals was licensed 
from a film of the same name, by Orion. You 
control a succession of the USA's elite fighters 
with the aim of destroying missiles held by 
terrorists. You must work your way through levels 
and find the exit to get to the next level. At the 
beginning and end of each level, there is a cut 
scene which consists of a still image with text, 
to progress the story of the game. 
 
You will of course meet many more fighters 
throughout the level, and pick up improved weapons 
as the game goes on. The gameplay is fairly 
standard platform work, seen in many other Ocean 
movie tie-ins. 
 
The Game Boy version of this game differs from the 
home computer version released around the same 
time. The level layout is different, there are no 
ladders ladders or ropes and you don't have to 
place bombs. This is possibly due to technical or

NBA Jam - Tournament Edition (c) Jun, 1995 Midway

This game lets you play two-on-two arcade 
basketball with players from all the NBA teams. 
Gameplay is fast and action-packed, with few 
rules, no fouls, and deliberately unrealistic 
jamming. Players are rated on eight ability 
categories, from steals and blocks, to dunks and 
3-pointers. 
 
Up to four human players can take part, each 
always controlling a single player for their team, 
and AI for missing players. This allows for four 
players to face each other in teams of two, or for 
two players to team up against a third player with 
a CPU team-mate. 
 
The Tournament Edition ups each team's roster to 
three players, and allows for substitutions 
between quarters. Shoving players now results in 
injuries, which lower a player's stats

Dec 07, 1990 Technos Japan Corp. / Technos Japan 
Corp. 
 
A GameBoy sequel to the Nekketsu Kouha Kunio-Kun 
beat'em up series. The story this time is that a 
newly established, yakuza-backed factory enforces 
a nefarious grip on Kunio's town. People that try 
to do anything about it disappear and gangs rule 
the streets, but when the main baddass Yuji 
kidnaps beautiful Miho from Nekketsu high the line 
is crossed. Now Kunio (with the optional help of 
his pal Riki in 2 player gameplay) heads to the 
factory across town to get Miho back and provide a 
sound beating to Yuji and anyone that gets in the 
way. 
 
Gameplay is standard 2D beat'em up fare, in which 
you must clear side-scrolling stages by defeating 
all enemies you encounter and getting to the stage 
exit, usually after taking out a stronger boss 
enemy. Kunio and Riki can execute a variety of 
punches and kicks using button combinations. The 
game features the same super deformed "cute" 
character design familiar to the series and 
retains most of the same attacks and moves 
although unlike other Nekketsu Kouha Kunio-Kun 
games in which pressing both attack buttons makes 
your character jump, in this one an uppercut is 
added for extra gang-smashing power.

Instead of featuring world-based teams as in the

Nekketsu High members, and thus the matches take 
place in schoolyards and several other locations 
from the Kunio Kun universe. 
 
3 modes of gameplay are available: Tournament, Vs 
for 2p gameplay via link, and a bean bag mode with 
different rules (such as no outfield characters)..

Nintendo takes its game to the gridiron with NES 
Play Action Football.  While Nintendo did not get 
the NFL license for this one, it did secure the 
license of the NFL Player's Association, so the 8 
teams to choose from (all named after the 
appropriate NFL cities) are all stocked up with 
real pro players from the 1989 season.  You can 
even substitute second-stringers for the "skill" 
positions (QB, RB, WR, TE, and FS/SS) when your 
starters get tired. 
 
Play perspective is very unusual: top-down 
slightly modified with a three-quarters tilt 
behind the offense, and the scrolling is diagonal, 
from the bottom left to upper right of the screen. 
 Each team has 12 passing and 12 running plays on 
offense, and the option to reverse play designs 
effectively gives you a total of 48 potential 
plays to run.  The defense has 8 cover plays and 8 
blitzes to select from.  The kicking and punting 
games are handled with a fairly typical 
directional arrow/power meter system. 
 
Games are divided into four 15-minute (accelerated 
real-time) quarters.  There are no penalties, but 
referees do appear onscreen to signal 
touchdowns/field goals, take measurements on short 
yardage plays, and shout "First Down!" (in audio) 
whenever a team moves the chains.  Team stats are 
displayed on a summary screen after every quarter 
of play.  Highest scoring team wins, which in 
playoffs mode means moving on to the next 
round--and an eventual shot at winning it all in 
the Power Bowl!

reach higher platforms, which can then be 
hand-climbed across. By collecting power ups Ryu 
can use a magical technique called "the art of the 
fire wheel", an ascending and spinning wheel of 
fire which will take more damage than his usual 
sword. He has up to 5 charges of this technique. 
Ryu has a life meter with six units, which can be 
replenished by finding proper power ups inside 
containers. 
 
The game is divided in 5 stages. Each stages has 
sub-screens, and the main objective is to go from 
left to right till the end of the screen, 
destroying the enemies in the way. Among the 
enemies Ryu will find humans, cyborgs and 
machines. At the end of each stage a boss fight

task Moonlight is armed with a katana, shurikens, 
bombs, and a sickle and chain weapon. Each weapon 
offers its own advantages and must be used at 
certain times to overcome specific obstacles or 
opponents. 
 
The game's coin-op origins are evident in the fact 
that it does not have passwords or saves. To 
compensate for this, however, adjustable 
difficulty settings were added.

Nintendo World Cup (c) 1991 Technos Japan Corp. / 
Nintendo of America Inc. 
 
This soccer game was made at the time when 
Nintendo introduced their four player adapter, and 
was probably made for the four playing purpose. 
This is shown clearly when you choose to play 2 or 
more players. Then you can choose between many 
different ground layers, like ice, grass and 
stone, which adds to the replayability. 
 
When you play a one player game you play the world 
cup as one of the top soccer countries of that 
time, and you meet countries in a fixed order. 
Cameroon in the first match and the final is 
against West Germany. In an old-school fashion you 
lose when you play a draw, there's no extra time 
whatsoever. 
 
In the game you always steer only one character, 
which you choose before the match starts. You can 
then give simple orders to you team-mates, like 
pass, tackle and shoot. Your moves are also 
limited to these moves. The game is totally 
lawless, so feel free to make elbow tackles 
without a wink from the referee. Probably it was 
made this way to be funnier to play against 
friends.

NIV Bible (c) 1996 Wisdom Tree, Inc. / Wisdom 
Tree, Inc. 
 
This cartridge contains the entire New 
International Version Bible, complete with simple 
or complex word search option, as well as two word 
games and a side-scrolling game. 
 
The side scrolling game, called "Joshua: The Lost 
Levels" on its title screen, is, as the 
cartridge's name implies, twenty levels for the 
Game Boy version of Joshua & the Battle of Jericho 
 for one or two players that were not in the 
original Game Boy release. 
 
Both word games are one player. 
 
The first of the word games is Bible Word Match, 
sort of a Bible-word-themed version of the Milton 
Bradley board game Memory. Words are randomly 
selected from the Bible and hidden in pairs on the 
screen. Move the flashing box to a hidden word and 
press A. The word will be revealed. Now move to 
another hidden word and press A. If the two words 
match, you gain ten points and the words will 
disappear from the screen. If they do not match, 
you lose five points and the words will be covered 
again. After three correct matches in a row, a 
cherry will appear. Capture it to get a thirty 
point bonus. After five correct matches in a row, 
a Boom will appear. Capture it to reveal all words 
briefly. 
 
The other word game is Bible Shepherd, a 
Bible-themed version of Hangman.  You have three 
sheep in a pen, the alphabet to select from and a 
word who's letters are hidden, showing only blank 
spaces. Move your cursor to a letter and press A. 
If the letter is not in the word, the sheep will 
stop moving. Select an incorrect letter again and 
one of the sheep will jump out of the pen. If you 
select a correct letter, its location(s) will be 
revealed in the word and, if you have sheep 
outside the pen, one will jump back in. You get 
one hundred points for each correct guessed word 
plus ten points for any sheep in the pen when the 
word is guessed correctly. If all three sheep jump 
from the pen before you can reveal the word, you 
lose.

Nobunaga's Ambition (c) Mar, 1991 KOEI Co., Ltd. / 
KOEI Corporation 
 
In the 16th century, Japan's Sengoku ("Warring 
States") period divided the nation into numerous 
feudal states, each ruled by a daimyo. These 
daimyos would often go to war with each other. 
Many dreamt of conquering the land, becoming the 
Shogun and ruling the entire country. One of those 
daimyos was the ambitious Nobunaga Oda, a 
merciless ruler and a renowned strategist. Players 
take on the role of Nobunaga Oda or one of many 
other daimyos to try to conquer Japan. 
 
Nobunaga's Ambition is a turn-based strategy game 
which can be played in different modes. Gameplay 
is similar to Koei's better known Romance of the 
Three Kingdoms game. Players begin by selecting 
either a 17 regions scenario or a larger 50 
scenario. Then, the player must select a daimyo, 
each of which is rated attributes in several 
categories

In this side scroller, you play as Abe from 
Oddworld: Abe's Oddysee. You have to save the 
paramites and scrabs from being turned into food

You'll need to get to, and unlock, the outer 
temple door, get all the temple lights lit then 
get through the temple to save the paramites and 
scrabs. 
 
This is essentially a side-scrolling, 
puzzle-solving game. You will use meat to distract 
paramites, use rocks to destroy explosives, use 
hypnotic chants to control a slig (who's gun you 
can then use), and use levers for various tasks. 
Sometimes you will just sneak past an enemy or 
paramite.

Olympic Summer Games (c) 1996 Tiertex Ltd. / Black 
Pearl Software 
 
Olympic Summer Games is the 16-bit official 
videogame of the 1996 Olympic Games held in 
Atlanta, the third and the last IOC official title 
to be released on the console. A typical button 
masher, includes 10 events (100m sprint, 110m 
hurdles, pole vault, long jump, triple jump, 
javelin, high jump, discus, skeet and archery) and 
32 countries around the world compete in custom or 
full Olympics, or just practice. Two players can 
compete head to head in the sprinting events, and 
a total of eight can play in the same game. Three 
difficulty levels allow competitive events for 
both rookies to veterans in the genre. 
 
Sprinting events are a short and straight button 
mashing frenzy. 4 athletes compete simultaneously, 
the first winner advancing to the next round (two 
qualifiers and then the medal run). Only fast 
fingers and quick shotgun reaction can earn world 
record times. 
 
Jumping events are a mix of shorter button mashing 
bursts combined with timely pressed jumps. From 
the straight forward high and long jump events 
(run and then set the jump angle) to the more 
elaborate triple jump (as the name suggests, three 
jumps must be carefully measured for world class 
results) and the complex pole vault, where a 
strong run must be followed by a sharp pole 
fixation and good a release upwards. Both long 
jump and triple jump have a first round composed 
by three jumps, the better eight progress into the 
second round, where they are given three more 
jumps. In the high jump and pole vault the 
competition continues until all athletes miss 
three consecutive jumps. 
 
The throwing events (discus and javelin) work in 
the same fashion as the jumping events, although 
trickier to pull, as the setting of the angle must 
be followed by a timely release. Each player is 
entitled to three throws, the top eight allowed 
three more attempts. 
 
Finally, the shooting events. Archery is a 
three-round competition where the goal is to amass 
as many points as possible by shooting at the 
inner rings of the target. With six arrows per 
round, each shot must be calculated according to 
the wind, choosing between steady aim and lower 
tension (must be aimed upwards and compensating 
the wind) or higher tension but a jumpy aim (can 
be aimed directly at the "gold" points). Skeet is 
a five round competition where the goal is to hit 
five clay pigeons before they disappear off-screen 
with two slugs for each.

Operation C (c) Feb, 1991 Konami Industry Co. Ltd.

Operation C is a Game Boy sequel to the popular 
NES titles Contra and Super C and is, essentially, 
a side-scrolling shooter. You play a Rambo-esque 
character that goes around shooting everything in 
sight, collecting weapon upgrades and bonuses. 
 
The game introduces the character of Black Viper 
to the series' oft-jumbled continuity.  Black 
Viper would later return in the Nintendo DS title, 
Contra 4, as the primary villain. 
 
The game features only five levels, two of which 
are played from an overhead perspective similar to 
Super C.  Operation C is also notable in featuring 
the upgradable Spread Gun (from three to five 
shots) and introducing the Hunter Gun. 
 
There is also the occasional platform element such 
as jumping puzzles, moving platforms etc., and the 
mandatory end-level boss.

Pac-Attack (c) Dec, 1994 Namco Limited / Namco 
   Hometek Inc. 
 
Based on Namco's Japanese-only arcade puzzler 
Cosmo Gang the Puzzle, Pac-Attack is similar to 
many block-dropping puzzle games from the time, 
such as Puyo Puyo. 
 
The objective of the game is to place ghosts and 
then, after three pieces (which can include one or 
two blocks as well), make Pac-Man eat as many 
ghosts as possible to try and clear up the game 
area. Pac-Man's directions are chosen at random 
between left or right, but as he goes moving on 
the game area (after you place him, of course), if 
he bumps against a block or a "wall" on the game 
area, he will change his direction. As with many 
block-dropping puzzlers, if a line of blocks 
and/or ghosts reaches the top, the game ends. 
However, by filling up a meter on the left of the 
game area, a fairy may appear that can clear 
approximately 6 or 7 lines with ghosts, but it 
only clears the ghosts, although the blocks that 
were on top of them will drop. 
 
Also, like many puzzlers, it contains a versus 
mode against another human player. It's similar to 
the many versus modes of puzzle games: eat plenty 
of ghosts and your opponent will recieve many 
ghosts on his area. 
 
The game also includes a Puzzle mode. It features 
100 levels, in which you have to eat all ghosts 
with no more than 4 Pac-Men at least (the number 
reduces in certain levels), and, unlike the other 
modes, you can change Pac-Man's direction with the 
press of a button. 
 
All of the handheld versions (including the one on 
Pac-Man Collection) lack the versus mode.

   European Tinies (from the Skweek/Super

Pac-Man (c) Apr, 1991 Namco Limited / Namco 
   Limited 
 
One of the most popular and influential games of 
the 1980's, Pac-Man stars a little, yellow 
dot-muncher who works his way around to clear a 
maze of the various dots and fruit which inhabit 
the board. 
 
Pac-Man's goal is continually challenged by 
   four ghosts: The shy blue ghost Bashful (Inky), 
   the trailing red ghost Shadow (Blinky), the 
   fast pink ghost Speedy (Pinky), and the 
   forgetful orange ghost Pokey (Clyde).  One 
   touch from any of these ghosts means a loss of 
   life for Pac-Man. 
 
Pac-Man can turn the tables on his pursuers by 
   eating of the four Energizers located within 
   the maze.  During this time, the ghosts turn 
   blue, and Pac-Man can eat them for bonus 
   points.  This only lasts for a limited amount 
   of time, as the ghost's eyes float back to 
   their center box, and regenerate to chase after 
   Pac-Man again. 
 
Survive a few rounds of gameplay, and be treated 
to humorous intermissions between Pac-Man and the 
ghosts.

Pang is a platform game which consists of 50 
levels in total. It can be played with one or two

can join anytime within the game. 
 
Your goal is to destroy the balloons which bounce 
around the playfield. To accomplish this, you can 
shoot hooks which travel upwards, and blow up any 
balloon they touch. Depending on their size, they 
either split on two smaller ones, or evaporate if 
they're at their minimum size. Apart from 
balloons, some levels also have barriers that have 
to be destroyed with your hooks, since they often 
block your access to balloons. There are also some 
barriers which cannot ever be destroyed. Your 
character has the ability to climb ladders, but 
cannot jump. 
 
You can also pick up power-ups such as: the 
ability to fire two shots at once, the hook that 
attaches to the ceiling and waits 'til something 
bumps into it, a gun which has a high rate of fire 
but cannot destroy barriers. Beside extra weapons, 
you can also pick certain things like clock 
(halting time for a small period), dynamite 
(reducing all balls to minimum size, thus making 
you able to reach more points), life, and such.

PGA European Tour (c) Apr, 1995 Unexpected

European Tour is best thought of as a remake of 
the original game, rather than a sequel as such. 
It features 5 courses from across Europe, and 60 
top European pros, rather than the US-leaned 
lineup of the original. The graphics are much more 
detailed and colorful, as you'd expect considering 
the intervening years of advances in programming 
skill. 
 
The control system is the standard three-click 
method used in most golf games, but you can now 
define intended draw/fade levels in advance of 
playing the shot, so that a perfect aim leads to a 
measured effect, and an imperfect one exaggerating 
the effect. 
 
As well as the Stroke Play games of the original 
(where you count the total score across the whole 
round of 18 holes, and compare this to your 
opponent), there are also Match Play (where the 
aim is to win as many individual holes as 
possible) and Skins (the same, but with money) 
modes as well.

As a pilot of a F-4 Phantom II the player's 
mission is to patrol the skies of the gulf because 
of renewed hostile activity. Phantom Air Mission 
is one of the few combat jet fighter games on the 
Game Boy. It features fully instrumented control 
panels, HUD targeting, radar and landing displays, 
complete 360 rotation and many more features. Most 
missions require the player to take out one or 
multiple bogeys, without crashing. The game's 
style is very similar to Flight of the Intruder.

Mario's Picross 2 (c) Oct 19, 1996 Creatures, 
Inc.|Jupiter Corp. / Nintendo Co., Ltd. 
 
Picross 2 is the Japanese only sequel to the Game 
Boy puzzle game, Mario's Picross.  Your goal is to 
reveal the hidden picture inside each grid by 
chipping away the correct squares.  Clues along 
the grid's edges help you figure out which squares 
should be chipped away, and which should be left 
alone.  The puzzles are much more advanced than 
those in Mario's Picross - easy puzzles are in a 
15x15 grid, while standard Picross puzzles are 
four 15x15 grids connected together, solved one 
section at a time. 
 
Picross 2 has two modes of play: the first, 
Mario's Picross, has you solving Picross puzzles 
with Mario.  In this mode, the timer ticks down 
from 30 minutes, and you must solve the puzzle 
before the timer reaches zero.  If you chip away 
an incorrect square, you are penalized time (first 
two minutes, then four, then eight). 
 
After solving a certain amount of puzzles in 
Mario's Picross mode, you can play Wario's 
Picross.  In this mode, the timer starts from zero 
and counts upwards.  You are not penalized time 
for any mistakes, however, this means that you do 
not know which squares are correct and which ones 
are incorrect until the puzzle is complete.

Pipe Dream (c) Sep, 1990 Assembly Line, The / 
Bullet-Proof Software, Inc. 
 
Each level of this abstract puzzler challenges the 
player to set up a network of pipes to allow an 
unspecified substance known as 'flooz' to flow 
through as many of those as possible. The pieces 
are offered in random order, and there are seven 
different types - straight lines going 
horizontally or vertically, corners rotating in 
each of the four directions, and cross-over pieces 
which carry the flooz straight across horizontally 
and vertically. Each of these can be entered from 
either side. When the flooz hits a gap, or a piece 
which the previous piece can't flow into, the pipe 
is finished. 
 
Before the flooz starts flowing from its 
randomly-selected starting position, the player 
has several seconds to start placing pieces. They 
can be put down anywhere. However a situation that 
can often occur is there will be a long and 
complex piping arrangement set up, yet a gap 
somewhere remains to be filled. Players are able 
to  replace a piece with another in the same 
square (to make it easier to flow the flooz that 
way), but for a slight scoring penalty. 
 
Bonuses are awarded for looping the flooz through 
both sides of at least 5 cross-over pieces, or 
passing the flooz through every square on the 
screen. Later levels have some squares on the grid 
blocked off, a few gaps in the side-wall (allowing 
flooz to thread to the other side of the screen). 
After every four levels there is a bonus game for 
points, in which the player can only place the 
pieces in the lowest open space in each column, 
similarly to the board game of "Connect 4".

In this game you are a 10-year-old boy, now old 
enough to receive your first Pokemon. You train 
this Pokemon by using it to battle with other 
Pokemon. Your main objective is to collect 8 gym 
badges to face the elite 4 and champion of Kanto. 
You do this by defeating each gym leader in a 
Pokemon battle. 
 
There are two parts in gameplay to this game. The 
first is your main character. You walk from place 
to place, goes up to talk to people, and find 
items. The second part of the gameplay happens 
when another trainer has seen you, or you come 
across a wild Pokemon. 
 
In the Pokemon battle, you can select from 4 
options: Attack, Pokemon, Item, and Run. In the 
attack option, you choose from the Pokemon's 
attacks to use on the opponents Pokemon. This 
either drains their HP (lowering a Pokemon's HP to 
zero will knock them out), inflicts a status 
condition (like sleeping or poison), or changes 
stats (attack power, speed, etc). In the Pokemon 
option you can switch the Pokemon in battle. In 
the item option you can either use items on your 
Pokemon (to heal them), or in a wild Pokemon 
battle you can throw a Pokeball to catch them. The 
run option is only available in wild battles, you 
cannot run from a trainer. The battle ends when 
one trainer has no remaining Pokemon. 
 
Your rival is always one step ahead of you, and 
challenging you to battles. You will run into the 
Rocket Gang, a group of criminals who use Pokemon 
for evil purposes. You must defeat many of their 
grunts and their leader in order to foil their 
evil schemes. 
 
You can also link up to Pocket Monsters Green in 
order to trade Pokemon or battle with your 
friends. This is necessary to get all 150 Pokemon, 
because not all of them appear in Red.

You start out in a simple town with just one

battle and catch 5 other Pokémon and train them to 
become strong enough to defeat your rivals. There 
are 150 Pokémon to catch, and along the way you 
can teach your Pokèmon new moves, so every Pokémon 
is different and unique. Because of this, no 
Pokémon is the best. You need to maintain a

challenge that you face. But remember, there are 
always other trainers out there willing to prove 
that they can beat you, so be prepared to battle 
it out with other trainers as well as the Gym 
Leaders.

Special Pikachu Edition battle it out with one 
another. You can trade your creatures with each 
other, because neither Blue nor Red has all 150 
Pokémon. Interaction is essential to becoming a

Pokémon in this enormous world. Catch them, battle 
them, trade them. Can you develop the ultimate 
strategy to defeat the eight Gym Leaders and 
become the greatest Pokémon Master of all time? 
 
Pokémon Blue differentiates itself from Pokémon

game. Common Pokémon in Blue are uncommon in Red, 
and those in Red may not even show up in Blue. It 
requires both games to collect all 150 Pokémon and

Pokemon - Yellow Version (c) Oct, 1999 Creatures,

Pokémon Yellow, along with Pokémon Blue and 
Pokémon Red forms the first generation of Pokémon 
games.  You control a number of fictional animals 
known as Pokémon and must travel the land using 
your current Pokémon to defeat and capture more. 
 
There are 151 Pokémon that fall into various types 
such as fire, water and grass that have a 
complicated rock-paper-scissors relationship.  You 
come across a series of town, each of which 
contains a gym where you must do battle with other 
Pokémon trainers.  Each gym specializes in a 
different type of Pokémon.  After beating each 
gym, you are given a new ability that lets you 
travel to new areas. 
 
The object of the game is to defeat all eight gym 
leaders, or ultimately, to catch all the varieties 
of Pokémon.  Some of them are not actually 
catchable in Yellow, so you must use the Game Boy 
link function to trade with friends using Red and 
Blue to complete your collection. 
 
Pokémon Yellow differs from the other 
first-generation games because it is based on the 
Pokémon animé series.  The main character looks 
like Ash and he starts the game with Pikachu, 
rather than choosing a Pokémon as in all other 
games in the series.  Character graphics 
throughout the game are based on designs from the 
series and it includes Jesse, James and their 
Meowth, which the other games do not.

fires your gun and the B button throws grenades. 
 
The object is to kill the bad guys who either are 
walking around or hiding in the environment while 
also picking up ammo, grenades and health by 
shooting them.  Your health is constantly drained

enemies field. 
 
This game includes a story mode, in which Arle 
(the main character) fights against computer 
enemies, a vs player mode, a four player mode

Star Sweep (c) 1998 Axela / Axela 
 
In this vaguely Tetris-like game, players score 
points by eliminating "star blocks."  A star block 
is a colored rectangle with a star on one end of 
it, and blocks are eliminated when the stars of 
two like-colored blocks touch each other.  While 
the game is being played, star blocks and 
obstacles rise from the bottom of the screen while 
the player moves and rotates a cursor which 
determines where additional star blocks will be 
thrown into play from off-screen.  The game 
features single-player and competitive play as 
well as a story mode featuring boss creatures and 
a bizarre plot -- apparently the whole game is 
actually a sport in which children poke a creature 
known as a star pig with sticks in order to make 
it vomit star blocks.

Puzznic (c) Aug 31, 1990 Taito Corporation / Taito 
Corporation 
 
The challenge in each level of Puzznic is to 
maneuvre a selection of blocks into place so as to 
clear them all, by making them make contact with 
blocks of the same design. You control a 
cross-hair, which can move a block left or right, 
which can cause it to fall if there is no block 
under the space it would occupy. 
 
There are many complications in terms of solving 
the levels. Moving platforms meaning that you need 
to move a block at a particular time, or in 
particular order, to prevent them being blockaded. 
In some situations there are an odd number of a 
certain type of block - solving these requires 
positioning two of the blocks one space apart, 
such that a move will result in a piece making 
contact with 2 others, and immediately removing 
all 3. You will also encounter blocks positioned 
on platforms suspended in space and gaps in level 
arrangements meaning that a certain number of 
blocks must be in place to make a certain move 
possible (by forming a stack, for example) 
 
The game structure is slightly unusual, as after 
you complete each batch of four levels you get a 
choice of 2 sets of levels - you are progressing 
through an expanding matrix of levels, which means 
there are 2 sets on level 2, 3 on level 3, 4 on 
level 4, and so on. This means that there are a 
total of 220 screens in the game. Each screen is 
played against a time limit, and losing a level 
(either by running out of time, or by making a 
poor move and leaving an impossible position) 
loses one of your 3 lives.

Q Billion (c) Apr, 1990 SETA Corporation / SETA 
U.S.A., Inc. 
 
In Q Billion, you play a mouse which must level 
out a playfield filled with stacks of tiles. To do 
this, the mouse must climb onto one stack and push 
a taller, neighbouring stack so that tiles fall 
off, until there are no tiles stacked on top of 
each other. Oftentimes, there stacks are not 
adjacent to each other, which forces the mouse to 
push a tile next to the stack in order to have 
something to stand on. Since the mouse is so weak, 
it can only move a single tile. This calls for a 
lot of juggling, since in order to move a stack of 
three tiles (represented by a 3 in a square), it 
must move a single tile next to a stack of two 
tiles, then move another tile to the other side of 
the small stack and push the uppermost tile of the 
stack onto the single tile in order to create a 
stack of two next to the stack of three. If there 
is a distance greater than one or two squares 
between the stacks, it makes the task daunting and 
requires a lot of planning, which puts this game 
straight into the old style of Japanese puzzles 
pioneered by Sokoban. 
 
Later stages introduce tiles of different kinds, 
symbolised by hearts, squares or stars. These 
tiles will, when moved together in groups of four, 
be eliminated

shooter. The player controls a submarine, trying 
to destroy the enemy fleet before they take the 
player's vessel out. Either the player takes out 
all the battleships causing the enemy submarine to 
surrender or he directly destroys the submarine to

System Co., Ltd. / Activision, Inc. 
 
The Real Ghostbusters, known as Garfield Labyrinth 
in Europe and Mickey Mouse IV: Mahou no Labyrinth 
in Japan, is a puzzle/platform game. The story is 
very simple: Venkman (or Garfield and Odie or 
Mickey and Mini Mouse, depending on the version 
you play) walk over a bridge one day, a tile 
breaks loose and Venkman/Garfield/Mickey falls 
down a deep pit, which ends up in a bizarre 
labyrinth, which Venkman/Garfield/Mickey must 
escape. There's no other goal apart from that, the 
player just needs to find the exit in each level. 
Apart from getting there, the exit must also be 
unlocked. For the latter, the player must collect 
all gems in the level. 
 
Each level contains various traps and enemies 
which need to be avoided. The puzzles involve 
finding keys to lower bridges or open doors, make 
use of teleporters and especially: drilling away 
blocks. Conveniently, the player finds a pneumatic 
hammer at the beginning of the game, which must be 
used to create paths to certain areas and items, 
without blocking the way forth or back. There's 
also an inventory to store items like keys and 
bombs (used to kill enemies). The protagonist has 
a health bar and can take several hits before 
losing a life, but there is also a time limit for 
each level. 
 
The game features a password system, a password is 
given automatically after completing a level. 
 
In spite of the differences in main character and 
a minor variation in the short intro cinematic all 
regional versions are identical.

Unexpected Development / Interplay Productions,

The crossover of the two 80s Action/Sci-Fi 
franchises comes to the Game Boy in this platform 
title, based very loosely on a Dark Horse comic. 
 
The player controls RoboCop, who, while taking 
care of law & order in Detroit, discovers some 
unusual troublemakers: Terminators sent from the 
future. To deal with the threat, Robo will have to 
make his way through an OCP factory and computer 
complex, where a time machine awaits that will 
take him to the post-nuclear wasteland of future 
Los Angeles. There, he must destroy the Skynet 
mainframe to free humanity from the machines once 
and for all. 
 
The game is a platforming affair. RoboCop must 
destroy various enemies while looking for the 
level exit, from various criminals in Detroit to 
advanced robotic probes, Terminators and flying 
Hunter Killers in in the OCP labs and the future. 
He is armed with a simple gun which can be 
upgraded once to a three-directional scatter shot. 
A single hit means the gun upgrade is lost, 
though. Life energy can be refilled through 
power-ups, and extra lives are also available.

Taking a rather literal view of the term 
'slap-stick humour', Rodland features two fairies 
called Tam and Rit, whose mission is to rescue 
their mum who's been captured and taken to a 
castle. 
 
There are 40 screens to clear, all full of 
baddies, who are disposed of by grabbing them with 
a stick, and flipping them from side to side to 
inflict damage. The hits needn't all be inflicted 
at the same time, as it's possible to release them 
to move them out of the way. 
 
When killed, each bad guy releases some kind of 
extra, ranging from points bonuses to various 
devices which can be used to kill other enemies. 
 
Each level also contains a certain amount of 
fruit. If you can collect all of this (with some 
bad guys still alive - you move on immediately 
once they're gone) you enter a bonus game, in 
which each enemy's death results in one of the 
letters E,X,T,R and A being released - collect 
them all for an invaluable extra life. 
 
In the Game Boy version the difficulty lies 
slightly lower because the player can use his wand 
even when climbing ladders.

a castle deep within the forest. When the king 
many years later was released he immediately 
unleashed legions of regenerating monsters on the 
citizens of the land. Now a hero (or two if you 
play it in multiplayer) is needed to defeat him 
and his minions. 
 
The game is an action based RPG played with an 
isometric perspective. As you battle your way 
through enemy territory you have two weapons, the 
sword that you start the game with and a Fire Wand 
that throws fireballs. You will also find some 
items to use, i.e. a magic axe that can be used to 
clear blocked passages, chamelon's ring that makes 
you part of the terrain and shield to help in 
defense.

R-Type (c) May, 1991 Irem Corp. / Irem Corp. 
 
R-Type is a side scrolling shoot 'em up best 
  known for its extremely tough and strategic 
  gameplay.  You control the R-9 spaceship as it 
  launches a last-ditch effort to repel the evil 
  Bydo empire. 
 
The R-9 comes equipped as standard with a small 
gun which can only take down the smallest of 
enemies without firing several shots. By holding 
down the fire button, it can be loaded up so as to 
release a large burst of energy, eliminating all 
but the strongest enemies in its path. From time 
to time, pods will come flying in your direction. 
Upon being shot, they release an upgrade. The 
first one will invariably be the one called "The 
Force", which is a weapons pod that clings either 
to the front or the back of your ship, absorbing 
any enemy bullets or acting as a bumper with which 
you can fly head-on into them. You can also use it 
as an offensive weapon by firing it and pulling it 
back in. Mastering the Force is vital to surviving 
in R-Type, since it must be used both as 
protection against bullet clusters, as a remote 
controlled cannon, and in order to clear the 
screen from obstacles. Other upgrades give you 
target-seeking missiles or a bigger main gun. 
Different gun types, differentiated by their 
colour, serve different purposes. The blue one 
sends laser beams bouncing across the screen (good 
for tunnels), the red one fires straight ahead, 
and the yellow one follows any walls it may 
encounter (good for artillery emplacements). 
 
The stages of R-Type are made in an organic style, 
certainly inspired by H. R. Giger's artwork for 
the Alien movies. When it came out, it was 
considered trend-setting since it broke off from 
the stereotypical sci-fi mould of other 
shoot'em'ups. In part, the levels themselves are 
your enemy, which is exemplified by the fourth, 
where spider-like creatures weave webs that cover 
the screen and block your path, or levels with 
intricate tunnel systems. Still, the levels are 
best handled with a combination of strategy and 
reflexes, without the memorisation that is 
required of R-Type's contemporary rival, Gradius.

discipline by adopting feudal codes of conduct and 
pitting its students against each other in 
constant duels. 
 
As expected the game focuses on the duels, 
represented as one-on-one side scrolling fights in 
which your character (armed with a bo-stick) must 
defeat a series of contenders in succession, each 
armed with their own weapons. 
 
Features a single-player "story" mode, which

Shanghai (c) 1989 HAL Laboratory, Inc. / HAL 
America Inc. 
 
Shanghai is a tile-based game based on the ancient 
Chinese game of Mah-Jong. 
 
The gameplay involves 144 tiles, which have to be 
removed by matching them into pairs. The tiles are 
arranged in a gridded pattern, which is higher 
near the center. A tile can only be removed if it 
is open on at least one side. 
 
This version of Shanghai was licensed from 
Activision by Hal Laboratory for release on the 
Game Boy.  Unlike the Shanghai series published 
under Activision, this port contains only a single 
game layout, that of the standard setup sometimes 
referred to as "The Turtle" or "The Pyramid." 
 
The game features two options for the visual style 
of the facecards, either in small designs or in 
simple letters or numbers.  The former is more 
decorative, but the latter is easier to read.  
There are also three options for background music 
that may be selected under a menu by pressing the 
Select button.  Like other versions of Shanghai, 
there is also a hint mode for when players get 
stuck.

levels play similar to other Jump'N Runs, as you 
have to avoid obstacles and kill enemies by 
jumping on them. However, since you are on a 
skateboard, speed plays an important role, meaning 
that you cannot immediately stop and sometimes 
need to drive at full speed to manage wider jumps. 
The top-down levels play more similar to other 
Skate Or Die games as gradients influence your 
driving while you are trying to avoid obstacles,

When Sonia Snake is kidnapped by the Nasty 
Nibbler, only two snakes can save her!  It's up to 
Attila and Genghis to eat their way through 
sixteen tricky stages as they avoid nasty traps 
and open the exits by standing on the scales to 
open the exit door. 
 
Sneaky Snakes is a pseudo-sequel to the NES game 
Snake, Rattle 'n Roll.  However, instead of an 
isometric playfield, the game is this time a 
standard sidescrolling platformer.  Players can 
play as Attila (or link up and play simultaneously 
with a friend as Genghis) through various devious 
levels.  The goal of each level is to eat enough 
Nibbleys (round creatures which come in assorted 
flavors including balloons, jellyfish, joggers, 
and more) to earn enough tail segments.  When your 
snake has enough segments, its body will flash, 
and you can weigh yourself to open the exit gate 
and progress to the next level. 
 
Each level has a time limit of 99 seconds - if 
this runs out, a giant ax will appear, chasing 
after your snake until it eventually destroys it.  
To prevent this from occurring, you can collect 
clocks which add another 30 seconds to your time 
limit.  You can also collect power ups such as 
increased jump height, tongue extensions, and 
diamonds which briefly make you invincible.

in the towers, Spanky must collect keys, which are 
sometimes held by the baddies. To aid him, he has 
a magic ball. Throwing the ball will stun the 
baddies for a short while, but not defeat them. 
However, by bouncing the ball it will grow in 
size, and depending on its size, it will explode 
in different patterns, and the shrapnel will kill 
off the baddies, clearing the way and releasing 
keys. 
 
Published by in Europe by Taito, Spanky fit 
straight into the company's portfolio of puzzle 
arcade platformers in the Bubble Bobble vein. The 
game also exists for the SNES, but the level 
layouts differ, as well as the fact that one 
cannot choose freely between the towers.

Speedball 2 - Brutal Deluxe (c) Oct, 1992 Bitmap 
Brothers, The / Mindscape, Inc. 
 
Brutal Deluxe doesn't live up to their name - in 
fact they're the worst team Speedball has ever 
seen. As their manager, it is your job to 
transform their fortunes. As well as the league 
system, which consists of 2 8-team divisions and 
challenges you to advance to the top, there are 
also 2 cup tournaments, one of which is played out 
over 2 'legs' with the aggregate score deciding 
who progresses. 
 
You can play the matches as well, which is the 
real meat of the game. They consist of 2 90-second 
periods, and the gameplay is futuristic, fast and 
frantic, with heavy tackling encouraged to 
retrieve the ball. Power-ups and tokens appear on 
the pitch, including ones to make your players 
extra-tough or freeze the opponents. 
 
The sides of the pitch each include a score 
multiplier, which you can run the ball through to 
increase the value of your scoring - the 
opposition can sometimes immediately grab the ball 
and nullify this. There are also 5 stars which are 
worth 2 points each if you hit them (more if you 
have the multiplier activated), but these can also 
be cancelled out by the opposition hitting the 
same star, and their points values only become set 
after the half. Next to the stars there are 
'portals' which throw the ball out the opposite 
side of the pitch, in the direction it was going. 
 
You get money for the results, and by collecting 
the silver tokens which appear on the pitch at 
random intervals. Between each match you can spend 
these either on improving your existing players as 
far as they can go, or on buying better ones and 
fitting them into the team. Your original players 
can only be improved to a certain extent, so 
remembering where your signed players are and 
making use of them is important. 
 
A variety of tokens also appear during the match, 
some of which boost your team's power for a short 
period of time, and one freezes the opposition.

each taking on spots of a particular colour. 
Starting from opposite corners, they take it in 
turns to move, either by 'reproducing' one of 
their spots to form another one in an adjacent 
square, or by making a jump, losing the square you 
did have but taking one two spaces away. 
 
When a piece lands next to one of another colour, 
that piece changes colour into that of their 
opponent. The winner of each round is either the 
last player with any pieces left, or the player 
who has the most pieces left when the level is

Square Deal is a card based game based on poker. 
52 cards are shuffled and then the top 4 cards are

There is a 5 x 5 grid that these cards are put 
into. In order to get the cards to disappear a 
poker hand must be lined up. Hands can only appear 
vertically or horizontally. The objective is to 
eliminate all 52 cards. If this is done, you 
advance to the next level. Levels differ in 
difficulty by speeding up the descent of the cards 
and limiting the amount of time you can pause the 
game to make decisions.

Stargate (c) 1994 Probe Software Ltd. / Acclaim 
Entertainment, Inc. 
 
The handheld version of Stargate is a matching 
puzzle game, similar to a 3-D  Tetris. Players 
drop tiles into a Stargate, and try to stack three 
identical symbols. Doing so clears those tiles. 
Mismatched tiles simply build stacks higher and 
higher, and the player loses if the tiles reach 
the top of the gate. The player is also given a 
seven-symbol Stargate "address" along the top of 
the screen. Stacking three copies of a symbol 
listed in the address will clear the stack and 
counts toward completing the address. 
 
There are two game modes building on this basic 
concept: 
 
1. Skill Mode is a single-player challenge 
   where the player tries to complete as many 
   addresses as they can before being overwhelmed. 
   Speed increases with completed addresses. 
 
Battle Mode can be played against the computer, or 
against a second player connected with a link 
cable. In Battle Mode, any stacks you clear are 
sent through the Stargate and appear on your 
opponent's side. A height level meter is added on 
the sides to show how close you and your opponent 
are to overflowing their gates. You can win by 
outlasting your opponent (while sending complete 
stacks through to make things more difficult for 
them) or by being the first to complete the 
address.

Star Trek - 25th Anniversary (c) Feb, 1992 Visual 
Concepts Entertainment, Inc. / Ultra Software 
Corporation 
 
This 1991 release was intended to coincide with 
the 25th anniversary of the 60's television 
series. The plot of this Trek is based around a 
giant "Doomsday Machine" that is destroying ships, 
planets, and other valuable stuff in federation 
space. The Federation has constructed a weapon to 
defeat the doomsday machine, but the Klingons 
think that it will be used against them. So, they 
steal the weapon and break it up into 12 pieces 
spread out over 3 planets. 
 
It is up to the crew of the Enterprise to travel 
to the 3 planets, recover all 12 pieces of the 
weapon, and finally stop the Doomsday Machine. 
There are two modes of game play. First, there is 
a side-scrolling shoot-em-up in which you pilot 
the Enterprise through asteroid fields and enemy 
fleets. Second, there is a overhead-view game in 
which you maneuver Captain Kirk around the planet 
to gather up the pieces of the weapon.

Star Trek - Generations - Beyond the Nexus (c) 
Nov, 1994 Absolute Entertainment, Inc. / Absolute 
Entertainment, Inc. 
 
Beyond the Nexus is based on the seventh Star Trek 
movie and its story: Captains Kirk and Picard must 
team up to stop a mad scientist from destroying an 
inhabited planet so that he might reenter the 
mysterious Nexus energy ribbon. 
 
The game has several different playing modes. The 
first is starship combat: seen from the main 
screen of the Enterprise (both the -B or the -D 
version) you navigate the ship through space, 
firing phasers or photon torpedoes at enemies like 
Tholians, Klingons and Romulans. Another mode has 
you navigating the ship to its destination by 
flying through rectangles in space. 
 
On away missions, the view switches to a top-down 
perspective where you control a single character 
and can fire your phaser at enemies. 
 
Finally, the game has two puzzle modes. In the 
first one, frequencies must be decoded: this is 
done by putting symbols into the right order. One 
can only guess the order at first, but after an 
attempt the game reveals how many of the selected 
symbols are part of the combination and how many 
are in the right place. Using logic, the right 
order can be determined, but there are only a 
limited number of tries. 
 
The second puzzle mode is used to reroute power 
from one system to another. To do so, a path must 
be built on a grid for the energy to flow through. 
The path must be built out of randomly assigned 
pieces that don't always fit together, similar to 
the concept of Pipe Mania.

you mistime your jump and spiked pits that will, 
well, skewer you as surely as in the original, 
swinging on ropes, and signaling the end of each 
level by ringing an enormous bell there 
specifically for that purpose.  Since our pal

About the game itself, it was one of the most

being the most prominent gameplay feature.

Superman (c) 1997 Titus France SA / Titus France 
SA 
 
Superman is a sidescrolling action game starring 
DC Comics' titular Man of Steel.  It features 
character designs based on Superman: The Animated 
Series.  In each level, you must collect a certain 
number of keys, and possibly fight a boss, then 
step on a marked area to leave.  Keys may be found 
around in the environment or collected from 
defeated enemies. 
 
Superman attacks by punching his enemies, or by 
punching to deflect their bullets back at them.  
He can navigate environments through standard 
walking, or, he can hold down the jump button to 
fly.  He must be careful of bombs which are 
floating throughout the levels as running into 
them causes loss of health.  He also must face 
other environmental hazards, like electrical 
barriers. 
 
Some levels put ground under your feet and play 
some like a normal platforming/fighting game, 
albeit with flight.  Others are all flying and 
forced scrolling, making them something like a 2D 
shooter with no ranged attack where you must hold 
down a fly button to stay aloft.

Sword of Hope II, The (c) Sep, 1996 Kemco / Kemco 
 
500 years ago King Winder had sealed the evil 
Demon Zakdos within a casket, thus ending the dark 
war. The great wizard Colin pledged that he and 
his descendants would build and protect a temple 
around Zakdos' prison. However, as a thief enters 
the temple and breaks the casket, Zakdos is set 
free and murders all that are left of the clan of 
Colin except for a young boy named Mute. To make 
things worse, the Sword of Hope, that has sealed 
away an evil dragon, is also stolen. The player 
takes control of Prince Theo who, with the help of 
Mute and other characters, must stop Zakdos and 
retrieve the Sword of Hope before the dragon 
awakens. 
 
The main difference between The Sword of Hope II 
and its predecessor 
is the fact that you have control over a party of 
up to three characters rather than controlling 
only prince Theo. Apart from that, both games play 
very similar. The world is seen from a first 
person perspective and your party can be moved by 
selecting an arrow that points in the desired 
direction. Commands such as "look", "open", "hit" 
etc. can be chosen from a menu to explore and 
manipulate the game-world, talk to NPCs or solve 
puzzles. When encountering enemies, you enter a 
turn-based battle mode in which you can attack, 
use items and magic or try to escape.

Summoning the dark power mammon the dragon turned

saved by the brave knight Pascal who flees with

Terminator 2 - Judgment Day (c) 1991 B.I.T.S., 
Ltd. / LJN, Ltd. 
 
Terminator 2: Judgement Day is a game based on the 
movie of the same name.  The Game Boy version is 
unlike the console and computer versions of the 
game.  The game takes place in two time periods: 
2029, when the Terminators have taken over the 
world, and 1994, when John Connor is ten years old 
and his future self has reprogrammed a Terminator 
to protect him from a more advanced model. 
 
In the early levels of the game, you play as the 
future John Connor - your objectives are to 
destroy generators to gain access to Skynet.  Once 
inside, you must make your way through Skynet and 
obtain a Terminator yourself.  These levels are 
played in a side-scrolling fashion.  The next 
level is a difficult puzzle - you must reprogram 
the Terminator so that it will protect John Connor 
instead of killing him.  You need to realign the 
wires so that power cells can reach their 
destinations and reset the program. 
 
Once you pass this level, you take on the role of 
the Terminator in 1994.  You must protect John 
Connor while on a motorbike being chased by the 
T-1000.  Later levels include infiltrating 
Cyberdyne to obtain the previous Terminator's arm 
and chip, and the final showdown with the T-1000 
at the steel mill.

T2 - The Arcade Game (c) Nov, 1992 Midway / 
   LJN, Ltd. 
 
As the title states, this is the home conversion 
of the arcade rail-shooter based on the film 
Terminator 2: Judgement Day. Up to two players 
shoot through future and present levels as robotic 
killers reprogrammed to serve the human 
resistance. 
 
Both players wield a machine gun with infinite 
ammo that lowers its firing rate (overheats) as it 
is continuously fired. A secondary weapon (missile 
launchers in the future, shotguns in the present) 
has limited ammo but deals heavy damage. Powerups 
inside the game world include secondary weapon 
ammo and coolant for the machine guns, and are 
shot to be collected. 
 
T2: The Arcade Game features seven levels based on 
specific scenes or general concepts in the film. 
The first four levels act as a prelude, as the 
player guns down waves of metal Terminators across 
a post-apocalyptic Battlefield, a besieged Human 
Hideout, and through the security checkpoints of 
the enemy supercomputer SkyNet. After destroying 
the computer, players travel back in time to 
protect John and Sarah Connor, while also 
destroying every scrap of SkyNet research at the 
headquarters of its manufacturer. From there, 
players must fend off the indestructible T-1000 
until the final showdown in the Steel Mill. 
 
Assets from the movie are used when possible, such 
as voice clips from Arnold Schwarzenegger, and 
close-up digital stills of Robert Patrick for the 
final battle against the T-1000. The Genesis and 
SNES versions also support lightguns (the Menacer 
and Super Scope, respectively).

Tamagotchi (c) 1997 Bandai Co., Ltd. / Bandai 
America, Inc. 
 
An egg arrives from a far-off planet in outer 
space.  This egg contains a 'Tamagotchi', a baby 
alien that cannot fend for itself, and requires 
your attention and care.  Look after the 
Tamagotchi and help it grow up. 
 
Tamagotchi is a game based on the popular virtual 
pet of the same name.  In it, you select an egg 
from the laboratory, and then it hatches in its 
room.  From there, you are fully responsible for 
its care.  Everything from feeding, medicine, 
playing with it, cleaning up its poo and scolding 
or praising it when appropriate - you must do it 
all. 
 
Unlike the actual Tamagotchi toy, the Game Boy 
version is not in realtime - you can adjust the 
Tamagotchi's growth speed in the game options.  
You can also look after up to three Tamagotchis 
simultaneously.  The Game Boy version also 
features three different games to play with your 
pet - depending on the game you select, it will 
improve their mood, their intelligence, or their 
physical fitness.  The three games are: 
 
Smile Game - Your pet will look left and right.  
Try to guess which direction it will face next. 
Study Game - Help your Tamagotchi study.  Simple 
math questions will appear and you must help it 
answer them. 
Sports Game - Keep your Tamagotchi fit.  Baseballs 
will rain down from the sky.  Get your pet to them 
before they hit the floor to score a point. 
 
Another feature exclusive to the Game Boy version 
are Tournaments.  You can enter your pet in Race, 
Beauty and Knowledge tournaments.  You can 
increase your chances of winning in these by 
training your pet, but make sure that when you 
enter them that it's not sick or spoiled, as it 
will not perform as well as it could.  Win a 
tournament and your Tamagotchi will be placed in 
the Hall of Fame.

version of the popular virtual pet series of 
games.  The Game Boy game is based on the Osutchi 
& Mesutchi versions of the virtual pet, which have 
both male and female versions which are able to 
mate with each other. 
 
The game lets you raise a Tamagotchi by taking 
care of it by feeding it, playing with it, and so 
on.  There are three special mini-games that you 
can play with your Tamagotchi: a memory match 
game, rock-paper-scissors, and a beach-themed race 
to the finish.  There are also other mini-games to 
play that don't involve your Tamagotchi. 
 
Players can also take their pets to different 
locations, such as the beach and out in a park.  
The game also keeps a record of all the 
Tamagotchis you have encountered. 
 
Like an actual Tamagotchi, the game cartridge has 
a built-in alarm which can be turned on or off.  
This alarm is used to indicate when your pet needs 
attention, such as when it is sick, has gone to 
the toilet, or needs to be fed.

The most popular American football game to hit the 
NES console, Tecmo Bowl pits the player vs. the 
computer in 11 game single-elimination playoff 
action, or you can go head-to-head with a human 
opponent in action or coach mode.  There are 12 
teams of real NFL players (circa 1988) to choose 
from, but don't look for official NFL team logos 
or mascots like Bears or Dolphins--Tecmo Bowl has 
the NFLPA but not the NFL license. 
 
The play perspective is top-down and the screen 
scrolls horizontally.  Player graphics are large 
and colorful, which is made possible by limiting 
the number of players to nine per team.  Animated 
cut-scenes are shown following touchdowns and at 
half-time, and crowds are shown filling the 
endzone seats. 
 
There are four plays to choose from on 
offense--usually two runs and two passes. The 
player takes control of the quarterback before the 
snap and then either hands off to the running back 
or works through his receiver progression from the 
top to the bottom of the screen.  Defense consists 
of trying to guess which offensive play the 
opponent will select and then taking control of 
one of the defensive players before the snap.  A 
very simple power meter system is used for kicking 
field goals, extra points, and punts. 
 
There are no game or season stats and there is no 
way to save your season, but there is a password 
feature allowing you to resume tournament play 
where you left off.

Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles - Fall of the Foot 
Clan (c) Aug 03, 1990 Konami Corporation / Ultra 
Software Corporation 
 
This game is the first in a series of Game Boy 
games by Konami based on the Teenage Mutant Ninja 
Turtles series of comic books, movies, cartoons, 
toys, etc. 
 
The basic premise of the TMNT is this: Four 
turtles, living in a sewer in New York, are 
exposed to some radioactive goo. The goo turns 
them into humanoid creatures and gives them 
approximately human intelligence. Hence, they are 
"mutants."  Also, they are teenage turtles, which 
means they all talk like surfers and like to eat 
pizza.  An equally mutated, but apparently much 
older, rat named Splinter acts as the turtle's 
guardian.  He trains the turtles to be ninjas, and 
to fight crime.  He also gives the turtle's their 
names: Michaelangelo, Donatello, Raphael, and 
Leonardo. 
 
In the game, the Turtles' TV reporter friend, 
April, is kidnapped by the evil samurai, Shredder. 
The turtles must rescue her and defeat Shredder. 
Gameplay consists of standard side-scrolling 
jump-and-attack action. Occasionally, hidden bonus 
games appear to give your turtle bonus health 
points.

story is basically unchanged.  Shredder and Krang 
have an evil plot to take over the world, and have 
kid-napped April. You have to guide the four 
turtles to rescue her and save the day. 
 
Back from the Sewers features 6 side-scrolling 
levels. In between levels, you are treated to 
bonus games that allow you to increase your health 
meter or rescue captured turtles. 
 
The music in the game is a surprisingly accurate 
rendition of the music found in the cartoon 
series.  This is also one of the first Game Boy

The third Ninja Turtle adventure on the Game Boy 
takes place one year after the events of the last 
game. Shredder has escaped from prison, and 
managed to capture turtle-friendly reporter April 
O'Neal yet again! Only this time, he manages to 
capture three of the turtles, Raphael, Donatello, 
and Leonardo, before the game even starts. So, you 
start out as Michaelangelo on a quest to rescue 
your pals and restore justice to the city. 
 
Radical Rescue differs from the previous Ninja 
Turtle games greatly in terms of level structure.  
The linear levels have been replaced with one huge 
interconnected fortress.  You progress through the 
game by finding the various bosses hidden within 
the fortress, defeating them, and then using the 
keys they leave behind to open up new rooms.  When 
you happen to find one of the turtles that has 
been captured, they become a playable character.

or Tetris on end, this game got into your head. 
Gameplay consisted of "flipping" tesserae, or 
tiles, from squares over adjacent squares. The 
result would either create a complex tile, or 
cancel out, resulting in the deletion of a tile. 
The goal was to clear the board entirely. Higher 
levels were designated by added tile complexity, 
and larger board grid sizes.

Tetris (c) 1989 Bullet-Proof Software, Inc. / 
Nintendo of America Inc. 
 
This version of Tetris is one of many conversions 
of the famous block-stacking game, and was 
included with the Game Boy upon its release in 
several territories. The goal is to place pieces 
made up of four tiles in a ten-by-twenty well, 
organizing them into complete rows, which then 
disappear. As rows are cleared, the pace of the 
game increases and the background changes, and the 
game ends if the stack reaches the top of the 
well. 
 
The game is very similar to Nintendo's own NES 
version of the game, featuring the same "Type A" 
endless and "Type B" set-clear modes. The game 
also features a 2-player versus mode that can be 
played with two Game Boys, two copies of Tetris, 
and a Game Boy link cable. Clearing lines in this 
mode will cause the other player's stack to rise, 
with the goal being to make the other player lose.

Tetris 2 (c) Dec, 1993 Nintendo R&D1 / Nintendo of

Unlike the original Tetris, Tetris 2 has you 
clearing the field of blocks in a different way. 
Each play field starts with different colored dots 
(in this case black, gray and white), with one of 
each color flashing. The blocks are made up of the 
same three colors, and by matching blocks of the 
same color over the top or to the side of the dot 
will clear the dot and those blocks from the 
screen. If you clear a flashing dot, all the 
corresponding dots of the same color will be 
cleared. To complete the round just clear the 
dots, not the blocks themselves.

Tetris Attack (c) Aug, 1996 Nintendo Co., Ltd. / 
Nintendo of America Inc. 
 
All is not well on Yoshi's Island! The devious 
king Bowser has cast a spell on the island's 
inhabitants, turning them into his mindless 
slaves. Only Yoshi has escaped its effects, and so 
he must set off to free his friends, and to defeat 
Bowser and break the spell. 
 
Tetris Attack is a fact-paced action puzzler 
featuring the colorful cast of characters from 
Yoshi's Island. A stack of blocks continually 
rises from the bottom of the screen, and the 
player controls a cursor which can swap any two 
blocks horizontally. Make a row or column of three 
or more and they'll clear, potentially creating 
combos from new blocks falling to take their 
place. Combos will send large garbage blocks to 
your opponent, which must be eliminated by 
clearing a piece that is touching it, turning it 
into normal blocks. 
 
The game offers a story mode against the computer, 
as well as a 2-player versus mode, an endless 
mode, a timed mode where a certain number of 
blocks must be cleared, and a puzzle mode where a 
set arrangement of blocks must be cleared in a 
specific number of moves. The game is based on the 
Japan-only title Panel de Pon.

In this version of Tetris, the basic 'clear the

with an added twist: inside the many block shapes 
are bombs. By linking the bombs while clearing the

more of the field is cleared as the bombs explode. 
 
The usual gameplay modes are included, i.e.

You play a small green guy who needs to blow up 
eight towers, because their presence is somehow 
poisoning the water of planets which could 
potentially be ideal colonies. Unfortunately you 
need to get to the top of these towers to blow 
them up. 
 
You make your way up to the top of the tower via 
walkways around the outside of the towers. You 
need to jump over, kick, and run from various 
enemies in your journey to the top. Most vertical 
movement is achieved by jumping onto moving ledges 
at the right moment. 
 
The game was considered revolutionary in its time 
for its graphic technique. As the main character 
walked around the outside of the tower, the 
character was fixed in the middle of the screen 
while the tower itself rotated. This gave it a 
pseudo-3D effect. 
 
Towers are linked together via a voyage through 
the sea in your trusty MK.7 submarine. This plays 
out as a side-scrolling collect-'em-up in which 
bonus points can be obtained.

Thanks to the Maita Flower, Trip World is at 
peace. It is being protected by an old Shabubu, a 
member of a race of bunny-like beings. The flower 
grows on the holy mountain known as Mount Dubious. 
However, one day the old Shabubu is attacked and 
the Maita Flower is stolen. Trip World becomes 
disarranged and its inhabitants don't stop 
quarreling with each other. But there is one hope 
in the form of the old Shabubu's grandson, Yacopu 
(also spelled Yakopoo). 
 
The player controls Yacopu through five stages in 
this side-scrolling platformer. The young 
Shabubu's trademark ability is to shapeshift into 
different forms. In his normal form, he is able to 
walk and jump as well as to kick enemies, Yacopu's 
primary way of attacking. Unlike in many other 
platformers, many of the enemies don't harm you on 
contact and push your character around instead. 
However, certain foes might attack you after you 
damaged them, while others do so from the 
beginning. 
 
At almost any time, the player can change to the 
flying or fish form. Flying Yacopu is able to 
reach places he wouldn't otherwise be able to, 
while the fishy hero is best suited for underwater 
areas. You also come across power-ups that 
temporarily give your character new powers, such 
as stunning enemies with seeds, bouncing around as 
a ball, or attacking with an extended tail. 
Beneath the mountain, settings in the game include 
a jungle, the ocean, and a castle. In each stages, 
you have to defeat a boss at the end. Eventually, 
you will encounter the one who stole the Maita 
Flower. The flower must be retrieved in order to 
save peace in Trip World.

Undercover Cops: Gaiden: Hakaishin Garumaa is 
based on Irem's Undercover Cops arcade game. But 
whereas that title was a beat-em-up, Hakaishin 
Garumaa instead takes place as a turn-based board 
game RPG. Similar in design to the later Mario 
Party titles, players begin by choosing one of 
three of the undercover cops. The player begins at 
the start location of the board and must use one 
of their "numbered value tiles". If the number 
chosen is above 1, the player must compete on a 
slot machine to try to win a value up to what was 
written on the tile. Following that, the player is 
able to move the number value, which they have 
won, of spaces on the board. Certain squares will 
activate events that include talking with 
characters, buying items and engaging in battle. 
 
Battles with enemies are handled by each side 
choosing one of the numbered tiles they own. The 
party with the higher number becomes the attacker 
and the lower value becomes the defender. Each 
side then chooses another numbered tile to 
determine the amount of "effort" put into the 
attack or defense as well as a position of the 
body to attack/defend. With that chosen, the 
turn's sequence plays out, with HP lost on a 
successful impact. Upon defeating an opponent in 
battle, the player gains XP and gold.

Based on the famous animated movie, Walt Disney's 
The Jungle Book is a platform game where you 
control Mowgli, the boy who was raised by wild 
animals deep in the jungles. Your goal is to find 
the human village so you may you join your kin 
once again. 
 
Mowgli is an athletic individual, and can jump, 
run, swing on vines or climb them without any 
problems. Most of the animals he comes upon, 
however, are inexplicably hostile, so he must 
defend himself with a variety of thrown weapons, 
such as bananas and boomerangs. 
 
To complete each level, Mowgli must collect a 
number of crystals (how many - it depends on the 
difficulty levels) within a time limit. A compass 
in the corner of the screen helps him by showing 
the direction where the nearest crystal is.

Wario Blast Featuring Bomberman! (c) Nov, 1994 
Hudson Soft Company, Ltd. / Nintendo of America

This game is about the same style as the Bomberman 
Series. The principal game functions are that you, 
as either Wario or Bomberman walk around on a 
level and try to blow up your opponent. 
 
By blowing up blocks that are blocking your way 
you can uncover power-ups, that can give you three 
abilities: 
1) The bombs get a longer blast. 
2) You can place more bombs at once. 
3) You get invulnerable but are also unable to 
   place bombs. 
 
Every power-up except for the third one works 
during the entire round and can be increased by 
picking up more power-ups of the same type. 
 
In the single-player game, you fight as Wario 
against different amounts of Bombermen, and at the 
forth course of every "world" you face a boss. 
 
In multiplayer, you play as either Wario or 
Bomberman, and try to blow up your friend / enemy.

Wario Land - Super Mario Land 3 (c) Feb, 1994 
Nintendo R&D1 / Nintendo of America Inc. 
 
Wario, Mario's greedy rival from Super Mario Land 
2: 6 Golden Coins, is more determined than ever to 
get a castle after being booted out of Mario's.  
He has heard that the pirates of Kitchen Island 
have a golden Statue of Princess Toadstool that's 
worth a king's ransom!  Wario figures that if he 
swipes the Princess' statue for himself, as well 
as all the other loot the pirates have hoarded, 
he'll have more than enough cash for a castle 
that's even bigger and better than Mario's! 
 
Wario Land: Super Mario Land 3 is different from 
previous games in the series in that you control 
the brutish and greedy Wario.  Even when small, 
Wario can break most bricks with a punch, and some 
enemies are so weak to him that they'll just be 
pushed aside!  Wario has a body slam attack that 
he can use to destroy enemies, and he can also 
pick them up and throw them at his foes.  If that 
wasn't enough, there are three different power ups 
that Wario can find. The Bull Hat lets him plough 
through bricks in a single hit, ram his horns into 
the ceiling to hold onto it, and butt stomp to 
stun all enemies.  The Jet Hat allows him to fly 
horizontally for a short period of time, and 
increases his jump height and speed.  Finally, the 
Dragon Hat allows him to breathe a long stream of 
fire for a short period of time. 
 
To suit Wario's greedy nature, the game revolves 
around money.  Throughout the stages, you can earn 
coins by grabbing them floating in the air, 
punching them out of bricks, or by body slamming 
into foes and then collecting the coins they drop. 
 You can also find hidden treasures buried deep 
within some levels by finding a key and then 
throwing it at the skull door to unlock it.  Once 
Wario reaches the end of a level, he usually needs 
to pay a toll to get the end-of-level door to 
open.  Pressing Up on the Control Pad and B pulls 
out a coin worth 10 coins, which you must throw at 
the door.  Once the door opens, you can exit and 
the level is complete.  Before you finish each 
level, you can choose to play a mini-game that 
doubles or halves the amount of coins you have, 
with a 50/50 chance.  You get three tries, and can 
choose to leave whenever you wish...so don't get 
too greedy!

perform a flying maneuver to decimate their 
opponents.  Players also can use their signature 
move once it has become available to use against 
their opponent in an attempt to win the match. 
 
Players can either compete in a single exhibition 
match or compete in an Elimination match where 
they face off against each wrestler in succession

Wheel of Fortune (c) 1990 GameTek, Inc. / GameTek,

Wheel of Fortune is based on the popular game show 
produced by Merv Griffin.  The goal is the same as 
the game show, which is to guess missing letters 
to solve a puzzle which covers the same subjects 
as found on the show, such as place, person, 
thing, phrase, etc. Like the game show, the 
players spin the wheel, select consonants, buy 
vowels and hopefully, solve the mystery phrase.  
The wheel can be "spun" at different strengths by 
sliding a bar across a selector, and the chances 
of earning a free spin, losing a turn, and going 
bankrupt remain. 
 
Game play is for up to two players taking turns, 
or for one player against the computer.  Gameplay 
moves through three rounds, and a bonus round for 
a grand prize.  Winning is accomplished, 
essentially, by earning the most money and winning 
the game by solving the phrases. 
 
There is even a "sexy model" that animates out 
onto the "stage"--though the resemblance to Vanna 
White is minimal at best.

Wild Snake (c) 1994 Bullet-Proof Software, Inc. / 
Spectrum Holobyte, Inc. 
 
WildSnake is a puzzle game in which the player 
must manage falling snakes in a  confined space 
and keep the snakes from reaching the top of the 
space. Snakes fall and slither until they reach a 
resting spot on the floor of the space. A snake 
will destroy any other snakes of the same color 
and pattern that it touches with its head on the 
way down, which often has the chain effect of 
loosening the pile of snakes so that all the 
snakes slither into new positions, possibly 
eliminating even more snakes. 
 
The game is played against a selection of 
backgrounds including desert, forest, water, or 
grass. Further, there are 7 game grids including 
the standard grid (a tall rectangle), X, plus, 
flask, Diabolo (an hourglass pattern), T-square, 
and obstacle (with a number of intermediate 
blocks). 
 
The player starts out as a nestling and earns 
higher and higher distinctions taken from the 
snake realm (garter snake, water snake, boa, 
mambo, python, king cobra, etc.) as more snakes 
are cleared. Also, as the level increases. more 
types of snake patterns must be handled. 
Sometimes, there is a flashing red snake that 
eliminates the first snake it touches. Further, 
there is occasionally an unstoppable snake that 
barrels down to the bottom of the space, 
eliminating all snakes in its path. 
 
The game can be played with 1 or 2 players in 
either easy, normal or hard mode. In the single 
player mode, the player can choose whether the 
preview showing the next snake will be shown. In 
2-player mode, there is always a preview window. 
In fact, there is a queue of 3 snakes between the 
2 player spaces from which the next snake is 
drawn. As a bonus during competition, multiple 
snake eliminations by one player result in 
obstacles appearing in the space of the opposing 
player.

WWF Warzone (c) Jun, 1998 Iguana West / Acclaim 
Entertainment, Inc. 
 
One of the first wrestling games for the Nintendo 
64, and one of the many for the Playstation. The 
Playstation version has better, CD quality music, 
but has less features. One of the main attractions 
was that WWF's Steve Austin did a lot of voice 
acting for it, although the other wrestlers don't 
have nearly as much speech. 
 
Features include custom player made wrestlers, as 
well as the real  wrestlers, many different game 
types (single player, multiplayer, royal rumbles, 
cage matches, etc.), but the career mode is where 
the action is, and you can build up your wrestlers 
strengths, and earn him belts.

Xenon 2 - Megablast (c) Oct, 1992 Bitmap Brothers, 
The / Mindscape, Inc. 
 
Xenon 2: Megablast is vertically scrolling space 
shooter, in which you have to pass several levels, 
filled with waves of enemies, that all end with a 
level boss creature. Each group of enemies you 
destroy grants you a cash reward and every once in 
a while you enter Colin's Bargain Basement, where 
you can use this cash to purchase upgrades for 
your ship like better weapons, speed & health 
upgrades etc. Some upgrades can also be picked up 
during the levels. 
 
The first part of the game has an organic feel to 
it, while the second part of the game features 
mechanical enemies. As there are some maze-like 
sections with dead-ends in the game, your 
spaceship  scrolls backwards when you keep 
pressing the down key. 
 
A typical Bitmap Brothers smash, the game is also 
famous for its soundtrack by British electronica 
group Bomb The Bass.

Yogi Bear in Yogi Bear's Goldrush (c) 1994 
Entertainment International (UK) Ltd. / GameTek, 
Inc. 
 
Jellystone National Park is in trouble and it is 
up to Yogi Bear to save the day.  The money needed 
to keep the park up and running for the winter has 
been stolen by an evil ghost named Jake, 
determined to shut down the park and has hidden 
them in 12 safes throughout the park.  The player 
must travel to six different locations to locate 
these safes (a forest, a pirate ship, the big 
city, an underground cavern, the old west and a 
final showdown with Jake). 
 
The gameplay is fairly simply, using Yogi the 
player can travel from left to right and right to 
left on the screen and to kill certain enemies 
they must jump on them.  Some enemies, however, 
can't be killed and must be avoided since Yogi has 
no weapons to harm them and avoid various pitfalls 
and hazards as well. 
 
There are no true power-ups, instead there are 
picnic baskets scattered throughout the stage that 
when the player picks up a 100 of them will get an 
extra life.  Likewise, there are icons labeled 
"1-UP" that will give the player and can pick 
items to refill their health.  There are also 
hidden doors and areas that the player must find 
in order to locate the various safes.  When the 
player enters these safes they must collect the 25 
gold coins to get a bar of gold, collecting 12 of 
these gold bars will give Yogi the money needed to 
win the game.

In order to eliminate the other shapes, you must

the same color as your piece, the shape is 
eliminated, as well as all of the shapes of the 
same color behind it, until your piece hits a

As Lolo, king of eden land, you have to puzzle 
your way through numerous screen-sized rooms. In 
each room, you have to collect all heart frames in 
order to open a treasure chest which contains the 
key to the exit. 
 
Different terrain types and enemies have to be 
avoided or used to your advantage to get all the 
heart frames. Some enemies don't hurt you at all, 
others only awaken once all heart frames are 
collected. Some shoot you as soon you cross their 
line of sight, then there are enemies that fall 
asleep and stay where they are once you touch 
them. 
 
Terrain types include grass that enemies cannot 
cross, sand that slows you down, but not the 
enemies, stones that cannot be crossed but also 
block enemy shots, trees that cannot be crossed 
but don not block enemy shots, water that can only 
be crossed with a bridge or an egg, arrows that 
cannot be crossed in the direction opposite that 
of which they are facing and others. 
 
Some heart frames give Lolo the ability to turn 
enemies into eggs and push them around like boxes. 
Eggs can be used to cross water, trap enemies or 
block their shots. In some levels, collecting two 
heart frames gives Lolo access to one of three 
items. These items are: A hammer that crushes 
stones, a bridge that can be used to cross water 
and an arrow that changes the direction an arrow 
tile is facing.

the game) in shop, which in term is accessed from 
the map. Power-ups allow, for example, to revive 
Bomberman when he dies in a stage or to increase 
the length of an explosion. Before entering a new 
area, the player chooses which panels to use in 
order to complete the area. 
 
The multiplayer mode are both player vs. player 
modes. In "Panel mode", each player can place only 
one bomb at a time and the bombs' radius starts at 
one, but panels appear in the field to improve 
this. In "Powerful mode", no panels appear, but 
each player can place up to four bombs at a time 
and the radius is four.

The huge Monster Tower stands near the village 
Monsbaiya. It is populated by vicious monsters, 
and few dare enter it. But the monsters in the 
tower lay eggs, and whoever takes possession of 
such an egg, can tame a monster which will come 
out of it, and those monsters, called "familiars", 
will help their tamers in times of danger. Some 
brave adventurers dared to enter the tower and to 
take the eggs. One of them was called Guy. He was 
killed in the monster tower. Now his son Koh is 
fifteen, and he is allowed to try his luck in the 
tower. 
 
You control Koh and his party of "familiars" in 
this unusual "monster-taming" RPG. You must 
capture the eggs from the tower, bring them home, 
grow monsters and tame them. During battles, you 
assign different commands to them. Different 
species have different abilities and need 
different approach. The battles system is a 
mixture of real time and turn based combat. Unlike 
most other console RPGs, there are no special 
battle screens.

Puzz Loop (c) 1999 Mitchell Corporation / 
Infogrames, Inc. 
 
Ballistic is a puzzle game in which the player 
must place 3 patterned balls next to each other in 
order to clear them. It is somewhat similar to 
Puyo Puyo in this respect. However Ballistic 
places the player in the center of the screen 
shooting the balls outward. In Panic! mode, a 
constant string of balls appear and the player 
must keep destroying similar balls to keep the 
string short and prevent it from snaking around 
and reaching the middle of the screen. In 
Checkmate mode, a limited amount of balls are 
given to the player which they must use to destroy 
all the balls on the screen. Strategy is used here 
since the amount of balls destroyed must be 
maximized. 
 
Ballistic also features a versus mode in which 
players can challenge one another. Similar to 
other puzzle games versus modes, one player's 
success results in additional balls on the other 
player's screen which they then must clear.

Balloon Fight GB (c) Jul 31, 2000 Nintendo Co.,

Balloon Kid is a unique side-scrolling platform 
game. You control a little girl who's brother has 
floated away on a big bunch of balloons. It's up 
to you to chase after him through 8 treacherous 
levels.  Instead of the usual jumping from 
platform to platform, you have a pair of balloons 
that allow you to float through the level. You 
must control your height carefully by tapping the 
'A' button. Meanwhile, the screen is always 
scrolling to the left, and you have to keep up. 
 
In addition to the single player adventure, there 
is a 2-player mode that allows you to compete 
against a friend via the Game Boy link cable.  In 
this mode you try to get your opponent to maneuver 
their balloon kid into the various level hazards.

Baseball Kids (c) 1990 Tose Co., Ltd. / Jaleco 
USA, Inc. 
 
The East and the West square off for nine innings 
of hard hitting baseball in Bases Loaded for the 
Nintendo Game Boy.  Experience the action as 
pitchers battle it out against a lineup of heavy 
hitters using fast, slow, curving and special 
pitches.  Each player brings their own unique 
stats and abilities to the game as you work your 
way through progressively more challenging teams. 
 
This portable version of Bases Loaded is loosely 
based on the title for the original NES.  In this 
scaled down version Major League teams are 
replaced with two teams representing the East and 
West Coast Divisions. With two Game Boy units and 
a Video Link cable players can go head to head - 
although each player will also need their own game 
cartridge. Single players can enjoy a quick pickup 
game by selecting an unofficial game of 1 to 9 
innings. An official game will allow a victorious 
team to move on to consecutive matches against 
progressively more challenging teams, a feature 
that substitutes for the traditional 'Season Mode' 
of most baseball titles. But you'll have to do 
this in a single sitting as no battery save option 
was included. 
 
Play in USA or Japan mode for a subtle change in 
the gameplay or learn how to best utilize the 
strengths of the East and West teams. Pitchers are 
rated 1 to 5 and batters get a rating for both 
running speed and hitting ability.

Game Boy Color version of Boarder Zone is 
substantially different from its PC namesake. 
 
This version features a pseudo-3D environment, 
where the camera is positioned behind the boarder 
and the piste scrolls towards the camera. 
Obstacles appear on the horizon and increase in 
size as they near the viewpoint. 
 
The two main game modes are 'Competition' and 
'Challenge'. 
 
Competition features a 'race attack' mode 
(basically a speed race with another AI player), 
Trick Attack (trick points based over 5 courses, 
beating a course threshold to advance), Time 
Attack (best time), and Supreme Attack (race with 
tricks). 
 
Challenge modes is about beating any previous 
records set for a particular track and supported 
Time Attack (best time), Trick Attack (best trick 
points), Slalom Attack (time on a flag course), 
and Vs Race (which uses the Game Boy Universal 
Link Cable). 
 
There is also a practice mode and a 'ghost 
boarder' - basically a replay of the player's best 
race. 
 
Trick moves include Mute Grab, Nose Grab, Tweak, 
Stiffy, Indy Air, Tail Grab, Stalefish, Shifty 
Air, Meloncholy, Frontside Air, Backside Air, 180,

Pang is a platform game which consists of 50 
levels in total. It can be played with one or two 
players on the same screen, and the other player 
can join anytime within the game. 
 
Your goal is to destroy the balloons which bounce 
around the playfield. To accomplish this, you can 
shoot hooks which travel upwards, and blow up any 
balloon they touch. Depending on their size, they 
either split on two smaller ones, or evaporate if 
they're at their minimum size. Apart from 
balloons, some levels also have barriers that have 
to be destroyed with your hooks, since they often 
block your access to balloons. There are also some 
barriers which cannot ever be destroyed. Your 
character has the ability to climb ladders, but 
cannot jump. 
 
You can also pick up power-ups such as: the 
ability to fire two shots at once, the hook that 
attaches to the ceiling and waits 'til something 
bumps into it, a gun which has a high rate of fire 
but cannot destroy barriers. Beside extra weapons, 
you can also pick certain things like clock 
(halting time for a small period), dynamite 
(reducing all balls to minimum size, thus making 
you able to reach more points), life, and such.

Catrap is a single screen puzzle game with 100 
rounds. You and your sister (or girlfriend?) have 
somehow been turned into cat-humans and you're are 
trapped in a castle full of baddies. The gameplay 
is best described as a mix between Boulder Dash 
and Soko-Ban. 
 
The goal is to clear each screen of bad guys, in 
100 increasingly difficult rounds. You can punch a 
bad guy by walking onto it from the left or right. 
You can't attack from above or below, but you can 
stand on top of a monster, or underneath a 
monster. Other elements to make the game more 
interesting are loose ground which you can stand 
on or dig through, ladders to climb and boulders 
you can push around. 
 
You can choose to play each round as a boy or a 
girl, but this doesn't affect gameplay, only the 
background music. In some rounds, both the boy and 
the girl are present at the same time. You can 
then switch between them with select-button, using 
both of them in clever ways to solve the rounds. 
During the game, you can rewind to undo certain 
moves. You can play the rounds in any order, so 
you can skip to more difficult ones and solve them 
at a later time. There is a round editor to create 
your own puzzles, but these self made rounds can't 
be saved.

DK and Diddy Kong have left in search of The Lost 
World after hearing of a contest to find it on the 
radio.  This leaves Dixie stuck with minding her 
baby cousin Kiddy Kong.  Frustrated at this, she 
decides to take Kiddy with her and find The Lost 
World before everyone else! 
 
As with Donkey Kong Country 3: Dixie Kong's Double 
Trouble!, Dixie Kong takes the lead in the third 
chapter of the Donkey Kong Land series. Dixie can 
glide using her hair, and carries barrels over her 
head.  Her partner is the heavy Kiddy, who carries 
barrels in front of him, and can jump a bit 
further by somersaulting over platform edges 
first. 
 
There are also special animal friends that can 
help the two primates out.  Ellie the Elephant can 
shoot water at enemies, while Enguarde the 
Swordfish can glide through water with ease. 
Squawks the Parrot can fly and spit eggs, and 
Squitter the Spider can shoot webbing as well as 
use it to create new platforms. 
 
Each level has Bonus Coins and DK Coins tucked 
well away in the levels.  While it's possible to 
gain an ending without these, to complete the game 
properly, players must seek them all out and 
unlock levels of the fabled 'Lost World'.  A new 
feature to the game series is a Time Attack mode - 
once players finish the game, they can attempt to

Dragon Quest III - Soshite Densetsu he... (c) Jul

Dragon Warrior III is the concluding game of the 
first Dragon Quest/Dragon Warrior trilogy, and its 
story takes us back to the time period of the 
legendary Erdrick (also known as Loto), the 
ancestor of the first game's hero. You are the son 
of a powerful warrior Ortega, skillful in physical 
combat and spellcasting. Your father went out to 
fight the evil Baramos, who is responsible for the 
appearance of monsters in your region, and never 
returned. You are sent by the king on a quest to 
continue your father's brave deeds and to defeat 
Baramos. 
 
Dragon Warrior III is a top-down role-playing game 
where you travel around the overworld, caves, 
castles, cities and other locations while battling 
random encounters, buying equipment, and talking 
to people. You and your party members receive 
experience when they beat up monsters and level up 
with enough experience, increasing their stats. 
The game features a day/night cycle - as you 
travel, day slowly changes to night and vice versa

The second in the Final Fantasy Legend series 
increases the amount of detail over the original 
in gameplay and graphics. 
 
The major changes are in the character classes and 
party members. Similar to FFL, starting a game of 
Legends II allows you to choose your main 
character from Humans, Monsters, Mutants and a new 
class: Robots. From here, you build your party of 
4 from the same character classes. During gameplay 
special side-characters will join you in battle to 
help defeat certain enemies. 
 
The other improvement is in strategy. In FFL you 
gain experience points after each battle, 
increasing strength, etc. In FFLII, you gain 
different points and abilities depending on how 
you defeated the enemy. If you win by using a 
sword, your strength increases. If you use magic, 
your mana increases. This adds a more strategic 
approach to defeating enemies.

As Great Greed begins, you are accidentally warped 
to another dimension by a wizard by the name of 
“Microwave”. With no immediate way back, you help 
the people fight off the scourge named “Bio-Haz” 
who is consuming this dimension with evil and 
destruction. 
 
This new dimension you find yourself in is not 
terribly unlike the one you came from, with the 
exception that everyone is named after foods or 
food-related items and most of the monsters appear 
to be mutated vegetables and the like. 
 
This RPG breaks from the normal formula in a few 
respects. The battle system does not use any 
menus, switching all commands to simple button 
pushes. A being attack, B for dodge, Start will 
run and the D-Pad is shortcuts to certain spells. 
The combat is also live, in the sense that if you 
take too long to complete your turn, your opponent 
will attack again. 
 
Using a battery-backed save system, the game will 
automatically auto-save after every successful 
battle.

In the first Harry Potter game for the Game Boy 
Color, the story of Harry's first year at Hogwarts 
School of Witchcraft and Wizardry is told in the

Playing as Harry, one advances through the plot of 
the book and the movie by fulfilling quests, 
battling monsters and gaining experience and 
levels. 
 
Combat is turn-based, with Harry being able to use 
a variety of spells against various critters and 
other enemies. In addition, card combinations of 
Famous Witches and Wizards Collector's Cards can 
be used to produce powerful magical effects. These 
cards can be found all over the freely explorable 
Hogwarts. Potions that refill stamina and magic 
points can be found, bought or mixed by Harry 
himself, but only with the right ingredients. 
 
As in other Potter games, Harry also competes for 
house points for Gryffindor, hoping to win the 
House Cup in the end. 
 
The game features several mini-games that, once 
found in the main game, can also be accessed from 
the main menu.

Harvest Moon is a farming simulator/RPG where you 
must build and maintain a farm during the course 
of a year, while taking care of your budget and 
yourself. 
 
You have the ability to buy, sell and take care of 
farm animals, crops and any other supplies that 
you may have. You can trade with many of the 
town's people, and fellow farmers. If you link up 
a friend's Game Boy, you can trade items between 
players as well. 
 
The local stores supply plenty of items to help 
you in your quest, at a cost, of course. And if 
you have the time, you can go about the town in 
search of a little fun away from work. 
 
From an overhead perspective, you can explore your 
farming area, the local town and the Harvest 
Sprite tunnels, full of strange and wonderful 
creatures that can help or destroy your quest. 
There are four seasons (Summer, Autumn, Winter, 
Spring) and each brings with it new challenges 
such as keeping arm animals warm during the colder 
seasons, and supplying water to the crops during 
the warmer periods. 
 
The GBC version includes all new characters and 
background sprites in full color, but is also 
backwards compatible with the original Game Boy 
version.

Kirby's Star Stacker is a Tetris-like puzzle game. 
 There are varying modes of play, such as Time 
Trial, Challenge and Story Mode, but the basic 
idea of play is the same: you must sandwich Star 
Blocks between two like Friend Blocks, either 
horizontally or vertically.  The Friend Blocks and 
any Star Blocks in-between are then removed from 
play.  Similar to Tetris, sets of blocks fall into 
the bin that contain any two of the following 
types: 
 
Star Blocks: The most important block, as all of 
the game types rely on it. Sandwich these blocks 
between two Friend Blocks either horizontally or 
vertically, and they will be cleared.  The more 
stars you clear, the higher the score. 
 
Friend Blocks: These blocks have pictures of 
Kirby's friends - Rick the Hamster, Kine the Fish, 
and Coo the Owl (all from Kirby's Dream Land 2) - 
on them. Match two of each to clear them from the 
screen.  Any Star Blocks between the two character 
blocks will also be cleared. 
 
Bomb Blocks: Sandwich a Bomb Block in between two 
Friend Blocks, and the bomb will explode, removing 
all blocks in the same row. 
 
Hard Blocks: You have to clear these blocks twice 
to clear them from the screen. Clear them once and 
they transform into an ordinary Star Block, and 
then can be removed in the normal way. 
 
The game also features a clever 'chain' system 
that rewards you for clearing blocks which then 
clear other blocks.  If you clear two or more 
blocks in this manner, then you'll be rewarded 
with Kirby raining down that amount of Stars, 
which can fill in gaps, which in turn could 
complete a row and allow it to chain even further!

Kirby no Pinball (c) Nov, 1993 HAL Laboratory, 
Inc. / Nintendo of America Inc. 
 
Kirby's Pinball Land is a game of pinball based on 
the Kirby series of games, with Kirby as the ball. 
 In the game you have to help Kirby defeat King 
Dedede and the three bosses who each guard one of 
the Pinball Lands. 
 
The game is divided into three tables or Pinball 
Lands, each consisting of four screens, three 
ordinary screens, and a boss screen  If you fall 
off the bottom of the lowest one, you lose a life, 
unless you press A at the right moment to activate 
the springboard, which becomes harder each time.  
Each screen has a variety of things to do.  The 
middle screen will give access to some sort of 
bonus game, where you must try to get as many 
points as you can, and can add to your bonus and 
bonus multiplier.  The bonus is added to your 
score when you lose a life, as in ordinary 
pinball. 
 
The aim is to defeat each boss.  To get to the 
boss you must perform a task on the top ordinary 
screen.  The bosses themselves must be defeated by 
firing Kirby at them, but they will try to stop 
you, sometimes by temporarily de-activating one or 
both of the flippers.  If you defeat the boss on 
each table, you face Kind Dedede himself.

Similar to Kung-Fu Master games for other 
platforms but with different levels, it is your 
job to fight your way through hordes of bad guys 
and ultimately kill the super-villain. To do this, 
you can use three different moves: a punch, a kick 
and a somersault. Sometimes you can also pick up 
bombs that deal a larger amount of damage. Apart 
from fighting the bad guys, there are also a few 
levels that feature Jump'N Run elements. At the 
end of each stage, there is, of course, a boss 
waiting to be beaten up.

Interactive Software, Inc.|Natsume Co., Ltd. / 
Natsume, Inc. 
 
This unique RPG provides a world of fishing as the 
prime objective. 
 
There are two modes of play, The Fish and Raise. 
 
The Fish: As a young boy, you must search out the 
fish called Guardian, the only fish in the river 
that can cure a disease caught by your sister, 
Teruyo. This mode combines RPG elements such as 
buying items, talking to the town's folk and 
searching the local river for the Guardian fish. 
The fishing element comes into play when you bait 
or lure fish at the river, in hopes to find a 
fish. 
 
Raise mode allows you to purchase a fish tank and 
the extras, and raise a small fish. Much like the 
many Pokémon type games, you can feed it, keep the 
tank clean and raise the fish.

Mario Golf GB (c) Oct 04, 1999 Camelot Software 
Planning / Nintendo of America Inc. 
 
Mario Golf on Game Boy Color isn't a straight port 
of the N64 game - it's a totally different game in 
its own right. It is a combination of a golf game 
and an RPG. As in an RPG, you choose your 
character at the beginning, with various strengths 
and weaknesses, and throughout the course of the 
game, your character gains experience points 
through winning matches or playing mini-games. 
Experience points can be distributed to various 
skills, such as putting, which makes it easier for 
you to do well. There are quite a few skills, and 
no two characters you can create will play in 
exactly the same way. 
 
Although the story mode is the main part of the 
game, there's quite a few other modes to keep you 
busy, like Tournament, Match Game, Stroke, 
Training, and the two-player mode via link cable. 
It comes with a dictionary of all the golf terms 
you'll need, and an extensive range of statistics 
on your player.

Mario Tennis for the Game Boy Color is a much 
different experience than its N64 effort. In 
addition to the core gameplay found in the N64 
version, the GBC version features an RPG-style 
world that allows you to work your way up through 
the ranks at the Royal Tennis Academy. 
 
The main mode, Mario Tour, has you starting off as 
a Rookie with low stats. By completing training 
programs and defeating other students, you're able 
to gain experience points, which allow you to 
boost your tennis stats. When you're not playing 
tennis, you can spend time wandering the Academy 
grounds: talking to other students, or just taking 
in the sights and sounds. 
 
In addition to the main game, there's also an 
exhibition mode (singles or doubles) for 
quick-play. And, if you get tired of playing the 
computer, the game supports the Game Link Cable 
for play against a friend.

Metal Gear - Ghost Babel (c) Apr 24, 2000 Konami 
Computer Entertainment Japan, Inc. / Konami of 
America, Inc. 
 
Metal Gear Solid (original Japanese name: Metal 
Gear: Ghost Babel) for GameBoy Color is not the 
same game as the popular Playstation/PC 
installment of the series. It is not set within 
the storyline of Metal Gear series, but instead 
tells an unrelated episode featuring the same hero 
- special agent Solid Snake. A secret government 
project, codenamed "Babel", attempts to revive the 
Metal Gear project - development of a highly 
destructive mech weapon. But an organization known 
as Gindran Liberation Front hijacked the Metal 
Gear prototype, without which any further 
development would be useless. Solid Snake is sent 
to infiltrate Outer Heaven, a location not 
entirely unfamiliar to him, and to retrieve the 
prototype. 
 
The game is similar in style and gameplay to early 
Metal Gear games. It is viewed from top-down 
perspective, and its gameplay is mostly based on 
stealth. Snake has to sneak past the guards, using 
various tactics to distract them or to kill them 
silently. Weapons, gadgets, and moves are all 
similar to those used in the other Metal Gear 
Solid game. From time to time Snake will also 
encounter bosses whom he will have to defeat in 
order to proceed to the next area. Virtual 
Missions for Snake are also included in this 
release.

Bakusou Senki Metal Walker GB - Koutetsu no Yuujou 
(c) Feb, 2001 Capcom Co., Ltd. / Capcom 
Entertainment, Inc. 
 
Metal Walker is a mechanical take on Pokémon, 
where the story takes place in the future on an 
island where a mysterious element called core has 
been discovered.  This "core" element was used to 
create a highly advanced race of robots called 
Metal Walkers that are used for both labor and 
protection for the people of the island.  One day, 
however, a gang of robots decide to rebel and end 
up killing a very prominent member of the island.  
The player then takes control of the son, Tetsuo, 
with the help of Dr. Hawk and Tetsuo's Metal 
Walker in an attempt to hunt down the rebel robots 
and avenge his father's death. 
 
The gameplay is very similar to Pokémon, where the 
player explores various areas of the island 
searching for clues called Data Packets and 
battling other Metal Walkers or wild Walkers 
called Metal Busters, but instead of capturing 
these walkers, the player instead destroys them.  
Destroying these other Walkers results both in 
scrap metal and items called Capsules that can be 
used to upgrade or "evolve" Tetsuo's Walker into a 
more advanced form.  Additionally, the player can 
take the scrap metal to the Junk Shop where they 
can also be turned into capsules as well.  
Additionally, capsules can not only contain 
power-ups, but traps as well that can be used in 
battles. 
 
The battles are also different, whereas this one 
the attacks consists of rolling attacks that are 
angled off of the walls of arenas.  Additionally, 
if a player fights multiple opponents, all of the 
enemies will be present on the screen at one time 
and if they choose the right attack and angle, can 
result in multiple hits on multiple opponents. 
 
There are also three types of Walkers: Land, 
Marine, and Sky where, just like in Pokémon, 
susceptible to the other (ex. Land walkers have 
advantages over Marine walkers but are vulnerable 
and weaker to Sky Walker attacks).  Base camps can 
also be built around various areas of the island 
and can be used for restoring the health of the 
players Walker. 
 
As the player progresses farther into the game, 
they will encounter over 100 different Walkers, 
each with their own strengths and weaknesses as 
well as bosses that have to be defeated in order 
to access more areas of the island.  Players can 
also use the Link Cable to both battle their Metal 
Walkers or even exchange their base camps.

Muddy Mole's wife and seven kids have been 
kidnapped by the evil farmer, Jinbei!  It's up to 
you to help Muddy solve the many puzzles of Jinbei 
Land.  Snatch all of Jinbei's cabbages in every 
level, and if you get stuck, dig underground and 
create your own secret underground paths.  A word 
of warning, however - Jinbei has got his best 
goons guarding your family, so you'd better watch 
out! 
 
Mole Mania plays from an overhead perspective.  
Although in each room you have to destroy all the 
foes to progress, the game is much more 
puzzle-oriented than it is towards action.  It is 
quite common in later levels to get yourself 
'stuck', which can be fixed by leaving and 
returning to the screen to reset the puzzle.  One 
of the game's clever 'hooks' is that players can 
dig underground in each stage to find a completely 
different map than they do above ground, which can 
be used to get through otherwise impassable 
terrain. 
 
The game also features a two player mode, where 
one player is Muddy, and the other is Jinbei.  
Muddy must swipe as many cabbages as possible, and 
Jinbei must stop him.  At the end of the round, 
players swap roles, and then the player who got 
the most cabbages wins.

Nekketsu Koukou Soccer Bu - World Cup Hen (c) 1991 
Technos Japan Corp. / Nintendo of America Inc. 
 
This soccer game was made at the time when 
Nintendo introduced their four player adapter, and 
was probably made for the four playing purpose. 
This is shown clearly when you choose to play 2 or 
more players. Then you can choose between many 
different ground layers, like ice, grass and 
stone, which adds to the replayability. 
 
When you play a one player game you play the world 
cup as one of the top soccer countries of that 
time, and you meet countries in a fixed order. 
Cameroon in the first match and the final is 
against West Germany. In an old-school fashion you 
lose when you play a draw, there's no extra time 
whatsoever. 
 
In the game you always steer only one character, 
which you choose before the match starts. You can 
then give simple orders to you team-mates, like 
pass, tackle and shoot. Your moves are also 
limited to these moves. The game is totally 
lawless, so feel free to make elbow tackles 
without a wink from the referee. Probably it was 
made this way to be funnier to play against 
friends.

Nobunaga no Yabou (c) Mar, 1991 KOEI Co., Ltd. / 
KOEI Corporation 
 
In the 16th century, Japan's Sengoku ("Warring 
States") period divided the nation into numerous 
feudal states, each ruled by a daimyo. These 
daimyos would often go to war with each other. 
Many dreamt of conquering the land, becoming the 
Shogun and ruling the entire country. One of those 
daimyos was the ambitious Nobunaga Oda, a 
merciless ruler and a renowned strategist. Players 
take on the role of Nobunaga Oda or one of many 
other daimyos to try to conquer Japan. 
 
Nobunaga's Ambition is a turn-based strategy game 
which can be played in different modes. Gameplay 
is similar to Koei's better known Romance of the 
Three Kingdoms game. Players begin by selecting 
either a 17 regions scenario or a larger 50 
scenario. Then, the player must select a daimyo, 
each of which is rated attributes in several 
categories

Operation C is a Game Boy sequel to the popular 
NES titles Contra and Super C and is, essentially, 
a side-scrolling shooter. You play a Rambo-esque 
character that goes around shooting everything in 
sight, collecting weapon upgrades and bonuses. 
 
The game introduces the character of Black Viper 
to the series' oft-jumbled continuity.  Black 
Viper would later return in the Nintendo DS title, 
Contra 4, as the primary villain. 
 
The game features only five levels, two of which 
are played from an overhead perspective similar to 
Super C.  Operation C is also notable in featuring 
the upgradable Spread Gun (from three to five 
shots) and introducing the Hunter Gun. 
 
There is also the occasional platform element such 
as jumping puzzles, moving platforms etc., and the 
mandatory end-level boss.

Pac-Panic (c) Dec, 1994 Namco Limited / Namco 
   Hometek Inc. 
 
Based on Namco's Japanese-only arcade puzzler 
Cosmo Gang the Puzzle, Pac-Attack is similar to 
many block-dropping puzzle games from the time, 
such as Puyo Puyo. 
 
The objective of the game is to place ghosts and 
then, after three pieces (which can include one or 
two blocks as well), make Pac-Man eat as many 
ghosts as possible to try and clear up the game 
area. Pac-Man's directions are chosen at random 
between left or right, but as he goes moving on 
the game area (after you place him, of course), if 
he bumps against a block or a "wall" on the game 
area, he will change his direction. As with many 
block-dropping puzzlers, if a line of blocks 
and/or ghosts reaches the top, the game ends. 
However, by filling up a meter on the left of the 
game area, a fairy may appear that can clear 
approximately 6 or 7 lines with ghosts, but it 
only clears the ghosts, although the blocks that 
were on top of them will drop. 
 
Also, like many puzzlers, it contains a versus 
mode against another human player. It's similar to 
the many versus modes of puzzle games: eat plenty 
of ghosts and your opponent will recieve many 
ghosts on his area. 
 
The game also includes a Puzzle mode. It features 
100 levels, in which you have to eat all ghosts 
with no more than 4 Pac-Men at least (the number 
reduces in certain levels), and, unlike the other 
modes, you can change Pac-Man's direction with the 
press of a button. 
 
All of the handheld versions (including the one on 
Pac-Man Collection) lack the versus mode.

In this game you are a 10-year-old boy, now old 
enough to receive your first Pokemon.  You train 
this Pokemon by using it to battle with other 
Pokemon.  Your main objective is to collect 8 gym 
badges to face the elite 4 and champion of Kanto.  
You do this by defeating each gym leader in a 
Pokemon battle. 
 
There are two parts in gameplay to this game.  The 
first is your main character.  You walk from place 
to place, goes up to talk to people, and find 
items.  The second part of the gameplay happens 
when another trainer has seen you, or you come 
across a wild Pokemon. 
 
In the Pokemon battle, you can select from 4 
options: Attack, Pokemon, Item, and Run.  In the 
attack option, you choose from the Pokemon's 
attacks to use on the opponents Pokemon.  This 
either drains their HP (lowering a Pokemon's HP to 
zero will knock them out), inflicts a status 
condition (like sleeping or poison), or changes 
stats (attack power, speed, etc).  In the Pokemon 
option you can switch the Pokemon in battle.  In 
the item option you can either use items on your 
Pokemon (to heal them), or in a wild Pokemon 
battle you can throw a Pokeball to catch them.  
The run option is only available in wild battles, 
you cannot run from a trainer.  The battle ends 
when one trainer has no remaining Pokemon. 
 
Your rival is always one step ahead of you, and 
challenging you to battles.  You will run into the 
Rocket Gang, a group of criminals who use Pokemon 
for evil purposes.  You must defeat many of their 
grunts and their leader in order to foil their 
evil schemes. 
 
You can also link up to Pocket Monster Akai in 
order to trade Pokemon or battle with your 
friends. This is necessary to get all 150 Pokemon, 
because not all of them appear in Midori.

baddies for a short while, but not defeat them. 
However, by bouncing the ball it will grow in 
size, and depending on its size, it will explode 
in different patterns, and the shrapnel will kill

keys.

When on a pleasure cruise for his tenth birthday, 
a young boy is swept castaway to a remote island 
by a fierce storm that destroys the entire ship.  
With no family or friends, he must fend for 
himself on this strange, seemingly uninhabited 
island and ultimately find a way to return home. 
 
Survival Kids is presented in an overhead 
action-RPG style similar to Link's Awakening.  
Players must try to survive through each day by 
getting enough rest, eating food and drinking 
water regularly.  This can be risky, as certain 
foods such as mushrooms can have varying effects 
including paralysis and poison, while other foods 
can go rotten and make you sick if you eat it. 
 
The game also features a unique "merge" system, 
which allows you to create a number of different 
items by combining two other items.  For example, 
combining bark and a stick would produce kindling, 
while using ivy with a bent stick could create a 
bow.  There are plenty of useless items that can 
be made in addition to the essentials, so it's up 
to the player to think as to what could be helpful 
in their quest to survive.

Tetris Flash (c) Dec, 1993 Nintendo R&D1 /

Unlike the original Tetris, Tetris 2 has you 
clearing the field of blocks in a different way. 
Each play field starts with different colored dots 
(in this case black, gray and white), with one of 
each color flashing. The blocks are made up of the 
same three colors, and by matching blocks of the 
same color over the top or to the side of the dot 
will clear the dot and those blocks from the 
screen. If you clear a flashing dot, all the 
corresponding dots of the same color will be 
cleared. To complete the round just clear the 
dots, not the blocks themselves.

Yoshi no Panepon (c) Aug, 1996 Nintendo Co., Ltd. 
/ Nintendo of America Inc. 
 
All is not well on Yoshi's Island! The devious 
king Bowser has cast a spell on the island's 
inhabitants, turning them into his mindless 
slaves. Only Yoshi has escaped its effects, and so 
he must set off to free his friends, and to defeat 
Bowser and break the spell. 
 
Tetris Attack is a fact-paced action puzzler 
featuring the colorful cast of characters from 
Yoshi's Island. A stack of blocks continually 
rises from the bottom of the screen, and the 
player controls a cursor which can swap any two 
blocks horizontally. Make a row or column of three 
or more and they'll clear, potentially creating 
combos from new blocks falling to take their 
place. Combos will send large garbage blocks to 
your opponent, which must be eliminated by 
clearing a piece that is touching it, turning it 
into normal blocks. 
 
The game offers a story mode against the computer, 
as well as a 2-player versus mode, an endless 
mode, a timed mode where a certain number of 
blocks must be cleared, and a puzzle mode where a 
set arrangement of blocks must be cleared in a 
specific number of moves. The game is based on the 
Japan-only title Panel de Pon.

Bamse, the strongest bear in the world, is a 
popular Swedish cartoon figure created by Rune 
Andréasson in 1962. This is his first appearance 
in a video game. The game was exclusively created 
for the Swedish market. 
 
The story goes, that Skalman has invented a time 
machine and together with Bamse and Lille Skutt 
they travel 75 million years back in time to the 
age of the dinosaurs. But the mischievous Vargen 
sneaks along and kidnaps Skalman to his "doomed 
castle". Bamse must now free his friend so they 
can get back to their own time again. 
 
Bamse is not an original game. Instead it is a 
re-skinned version of  Baby T-Rex by the same 
developer. This explains why the settings of the 
game appears out of context with very little to do 
with the original cartoon. It also suffers from 
translation errors and contain left overs from the 
original game which do not fit in. 
 
It is a very traditional platform game where you 
run and jump to get to the end of the stage. There 
are a total of 4 "worlds", each with 3 stages and 
a final boss stage. The gameplay is fast paced, 
with slides and skateboards for added speed. You 
can find small jars of "Dunderhonung" and bowling 
balls to throw at the enemies. There are also 
power-ups to replenish health and obtain extra 
lives.

Bomberman GB 2 (c) Aug 10, 1994 Hudson Soft 
Company, Ltd. / Hudson Soft Company, Ltd. 
 
This is a Japan only release, not to be confused 
with the USA release Bomberman GB, which is a 
different game. 
 
In the one player game, you are placed in an arena 
with a dark Bomberman for a best-two-out-of-three 
round. You must, using your bombs, blow him up 
without getting blown up yourself. After you beat 
him, the process repeats with two Bombermen then 
three Bombermen. 
 
After you beat the three Bombermen in two out of 
three rounds, you must beat a boss character to 
move on. When playing the rounds, you can find 
power-ups to increase the blast size, allow more 
than one bomb on the screen and, temporarily, make 
you invincible. When you beat the bosses, you gain 
things like the ability to kick a bomb away, run 
faster, ram enemies, etc. 
 
In a multi-player game, two to four players do 
their best to blow each other up. Multi-player is 
done with the Super Game Boy on a SNES. More than 
two players is only possible with a multitap. 
 
This game was released in the U.S. as Wario Blast, 
with some changes. The animated opening was 
removed and, of course, Wario was added.

Elite Soccer lets the player choose from 24 
National teams including the U.S., England,

in the World Cup tournament and win the coveted 
trophy.  Players can also choose to play in a 
Knockout-style tournament where instead of a round 
robin type of play like in World Cup, they instead 
play one game and advance to the next like a 
regular tournament.  There is also a two-player 
mode that allows friends to compete head-to-head. 
 
The main gameplay is the same as others with an 
overhead view with a third-person perspective for 
penalty kicks.  The rules and regulations are up 
to date and can actually be changed to suit the 
players style of choice.  They can also choose 
weather conditions, skills of goalies or even the 
choice to play either indoors or outdoors.  
Players can also edit their players including 
appearance and stats wise to suit their liking.

Gameboy Gallery 2 (c) May, 1997 Nintendo R&D1 / 
Nintendo of America Inc. 
 
The Game & Watch Gallery is Nintendo's first 
portable compilation featuring their popular line 
of original 1980's handheld games, featuring the 
popular "Mr. Game & Watch" himself, as well as 
Mario and friends. 
 
The compilation consists of four popular titles 
from the Game & Watch Series, each with a 
"Classic" and "Modern" version of each game: 
 
1. Octopus: Collects as much treasure as your 
   bag can hold, while avoiding the octopus 
   tentacles that continually swing around you.  
   In the "Modern" version, Mario becomes the 
   diver, and as he collects more treasure, his 
   bag becomes heavier, making it harder to return 
   to the surface.  Mario can also delay the 
   octopus tentacles by throwing treasure at them. 
 
Fire: Position your net to catch the falling 
people jumping from the burning building.  The 
"Modern" version has Mario and Luigi rescuing 
Toad, Yoshi and Donkey Kong Jr. from Princess 
Peach's Castle.  Each falling character has 
different weights and falling patterns. 
 
Manhole: The player must cover the holes to keep 
the continually walking people from falling 
through the manholes and into the sewers.  In the 
"Modern" version, Yoshi must use his tongue to 
keep Mario, Toad and Donkey Kong Jr. from falling 
thought the hole, each character having different 
speeds and patterns. 
 
Oil Panic: The player must collect the dripping 
blobs of oil before they slip past and ruin 
everything.  The "Modern" version has Bowser 
dropping oil blobs at Mario, who has to catch the 
oil and dump it over to Yoshi before the Koopa 
King gets the best of Mario. 
 
Each mode (Classic and Modern) has two 
difficulties: Easy and Hard.  The higher score a 
player gets in each version, new unlockable 
bonuses will become available via the "Gallery 
Corner".  These bonuses include release dates, 
pictures and animations which tell in greater 
detail the history behind Gunpei Yokoi's portable 
creations.

Space Invaders X (c) 1999 Z-Axis, Ltd. / 
Activision, Inc. 
 
In 1978, Earth successfully repulsed an invasion 
from outer space thanks to "the Tank."  The Tank 
was based on alien technology found when a scout 
ship had crashed years earlier.  Now, over 20 
years later, a new Tank has been created based on 
the technology recovered during the 1978 invasion. 
 And none too soon, because the Invaders are back! 
 
Space Invaders is yet another classic arcade game 
remake by Activision.  (See Battlezone and 
Asteroids.)  But this time, Activision licensed a 
game from Taito instead of Atari.  The game stays 
close to its roots while adding many power-ups and 
enemies. 
 
You can play either one or two players against the 
Invaders, who march down the screen in orderly 
rows and columns, at one of three skill levels.  
You'll start at Pluto and work your way through 
the Solar System to Mars, then Venus, and finally 
Earth.  There are four common aliens (red, green, 
blue, and yellow), plus seven more less common 
ones.  You receive special one shot power-ups by 
shooting four of the same type of Invaders in a 
row.  As in the original game, there are also 
Mother Ships that fly above the action, but in 
this version if you hit them you can pick up other 
useful power-ups like shields or double shots.  
Plus, after fighting off several waves on each 
planet, you'll face a unique boss.  If you manage 
to finish the game, you'll be able to play a 
reproduction of the original coin-op.

numerous island hazards, such as quicksand and 
enemies, while at the same time avoiding the Big 
Hat Hunter who is bent to send him back to the

With the help of his trusty tornado spin and the

Daffy Duck, Yosemite Sam, Sylvester and Wile E. 
Coyote) under a spell and they will try anything 
to prevent you from reaching your goal. 
 
You will have to guide Bugs Bunny through 60 
levels in and around the castle. In each level you 
have to find eight keys to unlock the door to the 
next level. 
 
You can collect carrots for more lives and there 
are a variety of weapons you can pick up to take 
care of your enemies, including bombs, lightning, 
cork gun, juice and weights. Other items such as a 
hammer or pick-axe can help you get past level 
obstacles. Shields, clocks and shoes will protect 
you from your enemies.

use elevators and climb through tunnels to

In this sequel to Boxxle, Willy's girlfriend has

enough money to buy a rocket and rescue her. And 
what better way is there to earn money than 
pushing  crates? And there are lots of crates to 
be pushed in all 120  levels of the game. The new 
levels are the major difference between Boxxle 2 
and its predecessor as there are no graphical 
changes to speak of. To solve all these levels, 
you'll once again have to push crates onto certain 
spots, which is made difficult by the fact that 
you can only push but not pull them so that it can 
easily happen that you push a crate into a dead 
end or block your own way. A password records your 
progress, but there is no battery to save your 
self-created levels.

In this game, you control Buzz through 14 missions 
on eight different planets. In each mission, your 
goal is to race to the end of the level before the 
bad guy does. If you do so successfully, you face 
off against the villain, and hopefully capture 
them. In addition to capturing the villain, there 
are secondary objectives like collecting robot 
parts and getting the fastest time through the 
level. 
 
Disney/Pixar's Buzz Lightyear of Star Command is a 
spinoff of the Toy Story series of movies. Unlike 
the Dreamcast, Playstation and Windows version's

Donald Duck - Quack Attack (c) Oct, 2000 Ubisoft 
Studios SRL / Ubi Soft Entertainment Software 
 
Released in conjunction with 3D versions on 
consoles, Donald Duck's adventure on the Game Boy 
Color is a traditional side-scrolling platformer. 
 
The evil magician Merlock has kidnapped Duckburg 
Times reporter Daisy Duck. Donald Duck turns to 
Gyro Gearloose for help, who suggests using his 
latest invention: a powerful teleporter. 
Unfortunately, Merlock learns of their plans and 
steals the blueprints to the device. Now Gyro uses 
the unfinished machine to teleport Donald to 
various locations, where he is to find the parts 
of the blueprints, so he may confront Merlock and 
rescue Daisy. 
 
Donald has to face four different worlds, 
including the forests near Duckie Mountain, the 
rooftops of Duckburg, and a haunted house. His 
abilities include jumping on top of enemies to 
defeat or stun them and double-jumping in mid-air 
to get to hard-to-reach places. Donald can only 
take one hit from an enemy (which puts him in a 
visibly grumpy mood), a second one means losing a 
life and having to start over the level. Goodies 
to be collected include various orbs that gain 
extra lives, restore Donald's health or put him 
into Hyper mode. In this mode, he can simply run 
over enemies to defeat them and also break down 
barriers to get to new locations.

the military to throw back the alien menace. 
 
There are seven levels in all. The player will 
travel through each level destroying the military 
to reach the end of the level and fight the boss 
monster. The only control the player has over 
Godzilla is his attacks as Godzilla will walk on 
his own from left to right on the screen in a 
linear path. There are four attacks to choose 
from: Stomp, Bite, Tail-Whip and the famous 
Radiation Breath.

Kingdom Crusade (c) 1992 
 
Different from the NES game of the same name. In 
the game the player takes on the role of the 
legendary Prince Valiant licensed from the cartoon 
series of the same name which is in turn based on 
the comic series Prince Valiant. Prince Valiant 
must lead Arthur's armies against the Tyrant 
Cynan. The goal is to capture all his castles or 
defeat all his armies. 
 
A giant over-map shows the world and is divided in 
tiles. Each tiles has different terrain and shows 
whether units or castles are present in a tile. 
Tiles are either white or gray depending on 
whether Arthur or Cynan controls it. 
 
Characters on the map can be directly controlled 
after being selected. This happens in a top-down 
view similar to The Legend of Zelda. Characters 
can attack and jump. Each character has different 
attacks. Items can be collected and the player can 
move freely between tiles. Moving through tiles 
that are occupied by the enemy conquers those 
territories, but the enemy can take them back at 
any time by moving through them again. If two 
enemy units meet on the same tile, combat ensues. 
In real time the player must try to defeat the AI 
opponent. This is done through dodging his attack 
and trying to land a blow. To conquer a castle all 
enemies including those in adjacent tiles must be 
defeated. 
 
It is also possible to find and collect items in 
the direct control mode. Items serve as power-ups 
that for example make the player faster or restore 
health points.The player can return to a castle at 
any time to heal completely.

Koro Koro Kirby (c) Apr 09, 2001 Nintendo R&D2 / 
Nintendo of America Inc. 
 
King Dedede is at it again, this time taking all 
of the stars from the sky. Thankfully for 
Dreamland, Kirby has returned to stop the evil 
King once more. But this time, he will need your 
help more then ever before. 
 
Kirby has been turned into a ball, and it is up to 
you to tilt and turn the game table so that Kirby 
can dodge enemies and get the the end goal. To do 
this, you must actually tilt the Game Boy 
Color/Advance console, thanks to the inbuilt 
motion sensor in the cartridge. Every move you 
make determines where the little pink ball goes.

$bio
 
 
Virtual Wars (c) 1993 Sales Curve Ltd., The / Time 
Warner Interactive, Inc. 
 
The Lawnmower Man is the game based on the 1992 
movie of the same name (itself loosely based on a 
Stephen King short story)  starring pre-Bond fame 
Pierce Brosnan as Dr. Lawrence Angelo, a scientist 
working for Virtual Space Industries in "Project 
5", a secret research that attempts to increase 
the intelligence of primates using psychotropic 
drugs and VR training. 
 
With his reluctance to aim the research to 
military purpose, after one of the chimps escapes 
and shoots a guard in the process he is given a 
forced vacation, and while taking notes on the 
need for experiment with a human subject, he 
notices Jobe Smith (Jeff Fahey), a simpleton who 
makes his living on odd jobs such as mowing the 
grass (hence, the title role). The first 
experiments quickly increase Jobe's intelligence, 
and while after an accident Angelo stopped the 
experiments, The Shop, a secret agency overviewing 
Project 5, reinserted the drugs responsible for 
violent behaviour into the program and sped up the 
treatment. As Jobe starts to develop telekinetic 
powers, he starts to take revenge on those who 
abused him before he started the treatments, and 
plots to take over all computers in the world. 
 
While the CD version of the game (PC, Mega CD) is 
an interactive movie, both cartridge versions are 
platformers, the player taking control of Dr. 
Angelo or Carla Parkette (mother of Jobe's best 
friend) in typical side-scrolling shooting action. 
The player can collect better weapons or data 
discs, which after collecting a number of them 
allow to morph into the Virtual Suit, which gives 
protection against a first hit. The player visits 
several locations seen in the movie, such as the 
gas pump and the VSI headquarters. 
 
The twists of the game are true-3D level 
connectors, based on the CG sequences of the 
movie, usually all involving avoiding obstacles 
(and the occasional shooting) at high speed in the 
VR world. There are four different (Virtual World, 
Cyber War, Cyber Run and Cyber Tube), each taking 
a slightly different approach (Virtual World is 
seen in first person, the objective being dodging 
obstacles such as trees and archs and reach the 
exit, Cyber War similar to Virtual World but with 
some shooting stops, Cyber Run is seen in third 
person and requires occasional shooting of 
obstacles, while Cyber Tube is a fast travel with 
plenty of enemies in a VR tunnel).

Estpolis Denki - Yomigaeru Densetsu (c) Sep 20,

The third title of the Lufia series gives us an 
entirely new battle and dungeon system. All of the 
dungeons in this game are randomly generated, 
which can get annoying at times. Otherwise, it's a 
lot like Lufia 2 in the dungeon department. You 
see the monsters, they move when you move and you 
can stun them. 
 
The battle system in this game is rather unique. 
You can use 9 characters in a 3x3 formation. The 
character in the front row deals the most physical 
damage, but also takes the most physical damage. 
Vice versa for the back row one, and the one in 
the middle row obviously takes and deals average 
damage. 9 characters might seem like much to use, 
but you can only let 3 characters attack during a 
turn

Looney Tunes: Marvin Strikes Back! is the sequel 
to Looney Tunes Collector: Alert!. This time you 
play as Marvin the Martian. After his defeat in 
the previous game he sees a video from Daffy Duck 
claiming he was the one who defeated Marvin. This 
ticks Marvin off and he goes back to Earth again 
to take revenge on Daffy. 
 
Marvin can only walk and shoot, so he has to rely 
much more on the other characters to help him (for 
example to fit through small holes or jump over 
pits). This time there are 45 Looney Tunes 
characters to collect and play with. These can 
again be traded and won in two-player mode. The 
game is compatible with the previous game, so you 
can bring characters from the first into the 
second game.

    sets out to find out more about Dr. Wily's 
    plans. 
 
Mega Man II follows the same formula as its 
predecessors, meaning the player has to complete a 
number of side-scrolling, platforming levels that 
are guarded by different bosses. Mega Man can only 
shoot left or right, but defeating a boss rewards 
him with a new weapon. Sometimes he will also find 
upgrades for Rush, which enable him to use Rush as 
a trampoline, a submarine or a jet. 
 
While Mega Man II is not a conversion, the first 
four stages look and play very similar to some 
levels of Mega Man 2 for the NES. Likewise, levels 
five to eight resemble some levels of Mega Man 3. 
The bosses of the first eight stages are also old 
familiars from Mega Man 2 and 3.

Rockman World 3 (c) Dec, 1992 Capcom Co., Ltd. / 
Capcom U.S.A., Inc. 
 
Dr. Wily is at it again!  This time, he's set 
    up an oil rig in the middle of the ocean and 
    is drilling deep down to the earth's magma 
    core.  The reason?  He plans to use the 
    incredible power generated to fuel his latest 
    diabolical robot creation!  Of course, only 
    Mega Man can stop him! 
 
Mega Man III follows the tradition of the previous 
Game Boy games - you must run, jump and blast your 
way through four boss worlds.  After defeating the 
four bosses, you will encounter an intermission 
level.  Once this level is beaten, you face four 
more bosses, then move on to the final showdown 
with Dr. Wily.  This is the first Game Boy Mega 
Man title to introduce the Mega Buster from Mega 
Man 4 for the NES.  If you hold down the B Button, 
you'll be able to charge up your cannon for a more 
powerful shot. 
 
Mega Man III combines Snake Man, Gemini Man, 
Shadow Man and Spark Man from Mega Man 3 as well 
as Dust Man, Skull Man, Dive Man and Drill Man 
from Mega Man 4.  In addition to this, there is a 
powerful Game Boy exclusive boss called Punk, who 
uses screw-like weapons to attack.

Rockman World 5 (c) Sep, 1994 Capcom Co., Ltd. / 
Capcom U.S.A., Inc. 
 
Mega Man's greatest adventure has come to the 
Gameboy! 
 
One peaceful day, Mega Man and his sister Roll are 
enjoying a quiet stroll through a meadow when they 
are suddenly attacked by a robot named Terra, who 
says that he and his soldiers, the StarDroids, are 
going to conquer the Earth! Mega Man attempts to 
fight off this new foe, but is quickly beaten by 
the StarDroid's far superior firepower. 
 
Later, Mega Man awakens to find Dr. Light standing 
over him, telling him that the StarDroids have 
almost taken over the world. But thankfully he was 
quickly able to examine both their firepower and 
their structures, and was able to modify Mega 
Man's weapon system into something much more 
powerful. Mega Man tries this new weapon, and 
finds that he can now fire his whole fist! Dr. 
Light dubs this new weapon the "Mega Arm"! 
 
Now, armed with the Mega Arm, and a new companion, 
the robotic cat Tango, Mega Man must destroy the 
StarDroids and save the planet while he can! The 
ultimate battle for the Earth begins!

hope left is in the Maverick Hunters, and their 
greatest heroes, X and Zero, to get to the bottom 
of this incident.

Boo has returned to Monstropolis and it is your

things difficult, Randal has destroyed her door. 
 
Avoid Randall and the CDA (Child Detection Agency)

home.  This platform scroller will have you trying 
to find out where you have been as you make your 
way through multiple doorways, up and down 
ladders, and more.  Pick up items along the way as 
you jump and dodge enemies, use your roar attack, 
push items, sneak, and more. 
 
In the GBA version, you get twice the levels and 
even a random map generator so every game is

You've finally been granted your Pokémon trainer's 
license. Now, it's time to head out to become the 
world greatest Pokémon trainer. Starting with just 
one Pokémon, you need to train hard and vigorously 
to defeat all 8 gym leaders and the Elite Four. 
 
You start out in a simple town with just one 
Pokémon. With that Pokémon, it's up to you to 
battle and catch 5 other Pokémon and train them to 
become strong enough to defeat your rivals. There 
are 150 Pokémon to catch, and along the way you 
can teach your Pokèmon new moves, so every Pokémon 
is different and unique. Because of this, no 
Pokémon is the best. You need to maintain a 
well-balanced team of six Pokémon to defeat any 
challenge that you face. But remember, there are 
always other trainers out there willing to prove 
that they can beat you, so be prepared to battle 
it out with other trainers as well as the Gym 
Leaders. 
 
Not only that, but Pokémon Blue allows you to 
interact with other Pokémon owners. Find a friend 
with Pokémon Blue, Pokémon Red or Pokémon Yellow: 
Special Pikachu Edition battle it out with one 
another. You can trade your creatures with each 
other, because neither Blue nor Red has all 150 
Pokémon. Interaction is essential to becoming a 
Pokémon master! 
 
It's going to take all you've got to collect 150 
Pokémon in this enormous world. Catch them, battle 
them, trade them. Can you develop the ultimate 
strategy to defeat the eight Gym Leaders and 
become the greatest Pokémon Master of all time? 
 
Pokémon Blue differentiates itself from Pokémon 
Red in that there are different Pokèmon in each 
game. Common Pokémon in Blue are uncommon in Red, 
and those in Red may not even show up in Blue. It 
requires both games to collect all 150 Pokémon and

It's going to take all you've got to collect 150 
Pokémon in this enormous world. Catch them, battle 
them, trade them. Can you develop the ultimate 
strategy to defeat the eight Gym Leaders and 
become the greatest Pokémon Master of all time? 
 
Pokémon Blue differentiates itself from Pokémon 
Red in that there are different Pokèmon in each 
game. Common Pokémon in Blue are uncommon in Red, 
and those in Red may not even show up in Blue. It 
requires both games to collect all 150 Pokémon and 
become a Pokémon master.

You've finally been granted your Pokémon trainer's 
license. Now, it's time to head out to become the 
world greatest Pokémon trainer. Starting with just 
one Pokémon, you need to train hard and vigorously 
to defeat all 8 gym leaders and the Elite Four. 
 
You start out in a simple town with just one 
Pokémon. With that Pokémon, it's up to you to 
battle and catch 5 other Pokémon and train them to 
become strong enough to defeat your rivals. There 
are 150 Pokémon to catch, and along the way you 
can teach your Pokèmon new moves, so every Pokémon 
is different and unique. Because of this, no 
Pokémon is the best. You need to maintain a 
well-balanced team of six Pokémon to defeat any 
challenge that you face. But remember, there are 
always other trainers out there willing to prove 
that they can beat you, so be prepared to battle 
it out with other trainers as well as the Gym 
Leaders.

These include new functions for the player's 
PokéGear, a Pokédex that can now be sorted by

Once again, the objective of the game is to become 
the champion trainer, and try to complete the 
Pokédex. To become the champion, the player 
battles Gym Leaders to obtain various badges. 
Completing the Pokédex requires a different set of

battling various trainers to obtain money, and 
trading Pokémon with NPC's and other owners of 
Pokémon games.

You've finally been granted your Pokémon trainer's 
license. Now, it's time to head out to become the 
world greatest Pokémon trainer. Starting with just 
one Pokémon, you need to train hard and vigorously 
to defeat all 8 gym leaders and the Elite Four. 
 
You start out in a simple town with just one 
Pokémon. With that Pokémon, it's up to you to 
battle and catch 5 other Pokémon and train them to 
become strong enough to defeat your rivals. There 
are 150 Pokémon to catch, and along the way you 
can teach your Pokèmon new moves, so every Pokémon 
is different and unique. Because of this, no 
Pokémon is the best. You need to maintain a 
well-balanced team of six Pokémon to defeat any 
challenge that you face. But remember, there are 
always other trainers out there willing to prove 
that they can beat you, so be prepared to battle 
it out with other trainers as well as the Gym 
Leaders. 
 
Not only that, but Pokémon Red allows you to 
interact with other Pokémon owners. Find a friend 
with Pokémon Red, Pokémon Blue or Pokémon Yellow: 
Special Pikachu Edition battle it out with one 
another. You can trade your creatures with each 
other, because neither Red nor Blue has all 150 
Pokémon. Interaction is essential to becoming a 
Pokémon master! 
 
It's going to take all you've got to collect 150 
Pokémon in this enormous world. Catch them, battle 
them, trade them. Can you develop the ultimate 
strategy to defeat the eight Gym Leaders and 
become the greatest Pokémon Master of all time? 
 
Pokémon Red differentiates itself from Pokémon 
Blue in that there are different Pokèmon in each 
game. Common Pokémon in Red are uncommon in Blue, 
and those in Blue may not even show up in Red. It 
requires both games to collect all 150 Pokémon and 
become a Pokémon master.

You've finally been granted your Pokémon trainer's 
license. Now, it's time to head out to become the 
world greatest Pokémon trainer. Starting with just 
one Pokémon, you need to train hard and vigorously 
to defeat all 8 gym leaders and the Elite Four. 
 
You start out in a simple town with just one 
Pokémon. With that Pokémon, it's up to you to 
battle and catch 5 other Pokémon and train them to 
become strong enough to defeat your rivals. There 
are 150 Pokémon to catch, and along the way you 
can teach your Pokèmon new moves, so every Pokémon 
is different and unique. Because of this, no 
Pokémon is the best. You need to maintain a 
well-balanced team of six Pokémon to defeat any 
challenge that you face. But remember, there are 
always other trainers out there willing to prove 
that they can beat you, so be prepared to battle 
it out with other trainers as well as the Gym 
Leaders. 
 
Not only that, but Pokémon Red allows you to 
interact with other Pokémon owners. Find a friend 
with Pokémon Red, Pokémon Blue or Pokémon Yellow: 
Special Pikachu Edition battle it out with one 
another. You can trade your creatures with each 
other, because neither Red nor Blue has all 150 
Pokémon. Interaction is essential to becoming a 
Pokémon master! 
 
It's going to take all you've got to collect 150 
Pokémon in this enormous world. Catch them, battle 
them, trade them. Can you develop the ultimate 
strategy to defeat the eight Gym Leaders and 
become the greatest Pokémon Master of all time? 
 
Pokémon Red differentiates itself from Pokémon 
Blue in that there are different Pokèmon in each 
game. Common Pokémon in Red are uncommon in Blue, 
and those in Blue may not even show up in Red. It 
requires both games to collect all 150 Pokémon and 
become a Pokémon master.

the genre, with you controlling your craft as the 
background scrolls vertically towards the end of 
the stage and trying to survive and destroy all 
enemies with your laser shots. Twinbee features a 
selectable power-up system in which you must shoot 
the bell power-ups to select which type of upgrade 
you want depending on the color they take (or in 
this case, the shade of grey). 
 
Features single player or two-player cooperative

Garfield Labyrinth (c) Oct, 1993 Kotobuki System 
Co., Ltd. / Activision, Inc. 
 
The Real Ghostbusters, known as Garfield Labyrinth 
in Europe and Mickey Mouse IV: Mahou no Labyrinth 
in Japan, is a puzzle/platform game. The story is 
very simple: Venkman (or Garfield and Odie or 
Mickey and Mini Mouse, depending on the version 
you play) walk over a bridge one day, a tile 
breaks loose and Venkman/Garfield/Mickey falls 
down a deep pit, which ends up in a bizarre 
labyrinth, which Venkman/Garfield/Mickey must 
escape. There's no other goal apart from that, the 
player just needs to find the exit in each level. 
Apart from getting there, the exit must also be 
unlocked. For the latter, the player must collect 
all gems in the level. 
 
Each level contains various traps and enemies 
which need to be avoided. The puzzles involve 
finding keys to lower bridges or open doors, make 
use of teleporters and especially: drilling away 
blocks. Conveniently, the player finds a pneumatic 
hammer at the beginning of the game, which must be 
used to create paths to certain areas and items, 
without blocking the way forth or back. There's 
also an inventory to store items like keys and 
bombs (used to kill enemies). The protagonist has 
a health bar and can take several hits before 
losing a life, but there is also a time limit for 
each level. 
 
The game features a password system, a password is 
given automatically after completing a level. 
 
In spite of the differences in main character and 
a minor variation in the short intro cinematic all 
regional versions are identical.

A dragon has gained control over the king of 
Riccar, manipulating him into removing the Sword 
of Hope from a painting, releasing its curse. 
Summoning the dark power mammon the dragon turned 
the people of Riccar into trees. When Prince Theo 
is born, the king tries to murder him, but Theo is 
saved by the brave knight Pascal who flees with 
him  into a forest where three magicians live who 
conceal the king's castle underground to prevent 
the evil from spreading. After living in the 
forest for 15 years, Prince Theo is finally strong 
enough to try and stop the dragon, using the Sword 
of Hope one of the magicians had retrieved. 
 
Sword of Hope combines Adventure and RPG elements. 
The prince can select commands such as "look", 
"open", "magic", "use" etc. to interact with  the 
game world, talk to NPCs or solve puzzles. When he 
encounters an enemy, the game switches to a turn 
based battle mode in which enemies have to be 
fought in typical console style RPG battles.

Selection II (c) Sep, 1996 Kemco / Kemco 
 
500 years ago King Winder had sealed the evil 
Demon Zakdos within a casket, thus ending the dark 
war. The great wizard Colin pledged that he and 
his descendants would build and protect a temple 
around Zakdos' prison. However, as a thief enters 
the temple and breaks the casket, Zakdos is set 
free and murders all that are left of the clan of 
Colin except for a young boy named Mute. To make 
things worse, the Sword of Hope, that has sealed 
away an evil dragon, is also stolen. The player 
takes control of Prince Theo who, with the help of 
Mute and other characters, must stop Zakdos and 
retrieve the Sword of Hope before the dragon 
awakens. 
 
The main difference between The Sword of Hope II 
and its predecessor 
is the fact that you have control over a party of 
up to three characters rather than controlling 
only prince Theo. Apart from that, both games play 
very similar. The world is seen from a first 
person perspective and your party can be moved by 
selecting an arrow that points in the desired 
direction. Commands such as "look", "open", "hit" 
etc. can be chosen from a menu to explore and 
manipulate the game-world, talk to NPCs or solve 
puzzles. When encountering enemies, you enter a 
turn-based battle mode in which you can attack, 
use items and magic or try to escape.

Teenage Mutant Hero Turtles - Fall of the Foot 
Clan (c) Aug 03, 1990 Konami Corporation / Ultra 
Software Corporation 
 
This game is the first in a series of Game Boy 
games by Konami based on the Teenage Mutant Ninja 
Turtles series of comic books, movies, cartoons, 
toys, etc. 
 
The basic premise of the TMNT is this: Four 
turtles, living in a sewer in New York, are 
exposed to some radioactive goo. The goo turns 
them into humanoid creatures and gives them 
approximately human intelligence. Hence, they are 
"mutants."  Also, they are teenage turtles, which 
means they all talk like surfers and like to eat 
pizza.  An equally mutated, but apparently much 
older, rat named Splinter acts as the turtle's 
guardian.  He trains the turtles to be ninjas, and 
to fight crime.  He also gives the turtle's their

Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles (c) Aug 03, 1990 
Konami Corporation / Ultra Software Corporation 
 
This game is the first in a series of Game Boy 
games by Konami based on the Teenage Mutant Ninja 
Turtles series of comic books, movies, cartoons, 
toys, etc. 
 
The basic premise of the TMNT is this: Four 
turtles, living in a sewer in New York, are 
exposed to some radioactive goo. The goo turns 
them into humanoid creatures and gives them 
approximately human intelligence. Hence, they are 
"mutants."  Also, they are teenage turtles, which 
means they all talk like surfers and like to eat 
pizza.  An equally mutated, but apparently much 
older, rat named Splinter acts as the turtle's 
guardian.  He trains the turtles to be ninjas, and 
to fight crime.  He also gives the turtle's their 
names: Michaelangelo, Donatello, Raphael, and 
Leonardo. 
 
In the game, the Turtles' TV reporter friend, 
April, is kidnapped by the evil samurai, Shredder. 
The turtles must rescue her and defeat Shredder. 
Gameplay consists of standard side-scrolling 
jump-and-attack action. Occasionally, hidden bonus 
games appear to give your turtle bonus health 
points.

Teenage Mutant Hero Turtles - Back From the Sewers 
(c) Dec, 1991 Konami Co., Ltd. / Konami, Inc. 
 
The second TMNT game for the Game Boy brings more 
of the same action that we saw in the first.  The 
story is basically unchanged.  Shredder and Krang 
have an evil plot to take over the world, and have 
kid-napped April. You have to guide the four 
turtles to rescue her and save the day. 
 
Back from the Sewers features 6 side-scrolling 
levels. In between levels, you are treated to 
bonus games that allow you to increase your health 
meter or rescue captured turtles. 
 
The music in the game is a surprisingly accurate 
rendition of the music found in the cartoon 
series.  This is also one of the first Game Boy 
games to feature digitized speech.

Teenage Mutant Hero Turtles III - Radical Rescue 
(c) Nov, 1993 Konami Co., Ltd. / Konami (America), 
Inc. 
 
The third Ninja Turtle adventure on the Game Boy 
takes place one year after the events of the last 
game. Shredder has escaped from prison, and 
managed to capture turtle-friendly reporter April 
O'Neal yet again! Only this time, he manages to 
capture three of the turtles, Raphael, Donatello, 
and Leonardo, before the game even starts. So, you 
start out as Michaelangelo on a quest to rescue 
your pals and restore justice to the city. 
 
Radical Rescue differs from the previous Ninja 
Turtle games greatly in terms of level structure.  
The linear levels have been replaced with one huge 
interconnected fortress.  You progress through the 
game by finding the various bosses hidden within 
the fortress, defeating them, and then using the 
keys they leave behind to open up new rooms.  When 
you happen to find one of the turtles that has 
been captured, they become a playable character.

Super Snakey (c) 1994 Bullet-Proof Software, Inc. 
/ Spectrum Holobyte, Inc. 
 
WildSnake is a puzzle game in which the player 
must manage falling snakes in a  confined space 
and keep the snakes from reaching the top of the 
space. Snakes fall and slither until they reach a 
resting spot on the floor of the space. A snake 
will destroy any other snakes of the same color 
and pattern that it touches with its head on the 
way down, which often has the chain effect of 
loosening the pile of snakes so that all the 
snakes slither into new positions, possibly 
eliminating even more snakes. 
 
The game is played against a selection of 
backgrounds including desert, forest, water, or 
grass. Further, there are 7 game grids including 
the standard grid (a tall rectangle), X, plus, 
flask, Diabolo (an hourglass pattern), T-square, 
and obstacle (with a number of intermediate 
blocks). 
 
The player starts out as a nestling and earns 
higher and higher distinctions taken from the 
snake realm (garter snake, water snake, boa, 
mambo, python, king cobra, etc.) as more snakes 
are cleared. Also, as the level increases. more 
types of snake patterns must be handled. 
Sometimes, there is a flashing red snake that 
eliminates the first snake it touches. Further, 
there is occasionally an unstoppable snake that 
barrels down to the bottom of the space, 
eliminating all snakes in its path. 
 
The game can be played with 1 or 2 players in 
either easy, normal or hard mode. In the single 
player mode, the player can choose whether the 
preview showing the next snake will be shown. In 
2-player mode, there is always a preview window. 
In fact, there is a queue of 3 snakes between the 
2 player spaces from which the next snake is 
drawn. As a bonus during competition, multiple 
snake eliminations by one player result in 
obstacles appearing in the space of the opposing 
player.

Nigel Mansell's World Championship '93 (c) 1993 
Gremlin Graphics Software Ltd. / GameTek, Inc. 
 
Timing smiled on Gremlin with this licensed 
Formula 1 simulation, as Nigel's long quest for a 
championship had finally come good. The game was 
pitched somewhere in between a full-blown 
simulation like F1 GP and action games like 
Continental Circus. Only 12 cars were in each 
race, which could last from between 3 and 20 laps. 
 
Before each race you can customize wing downforce, 
gear ratio, tyre selection and fuel load choices – 
pitstops are a standard feature of the longer 
races. The 16-bit versions include a unique 
'Improve With Mansell' mode, in which a digitized 
version of Nigel's head appears in the top corner 
of the screen, offering instructions and praise.

Hudson Soft Company, Ltd. / Hudson Soft USA, Inc. 
 
In Adventure Island II: Aliens in Paradise the 
player takes the role of Master Higgins who has to 
save his cavegirl from aliens which also want to 
dominate the Earth. The basic gameplay elements 
are the same as in its predecessor Adventure 
Island: Master Higgins walks through the levels 
while fighting against various enemies. One hit 
results in his untimely death unless he carries 
one of the various power ups, e.g. weapons or a 
skateboard which improves his speed. He also needs 
to collect food to fill up his steadily decreasing 
starvation bar - death awaits if it hits zero. 
 
A big addition are dinosaurs which serve as mount 
and offer different abilities, e.g. flying or 
shooting fireballs. Like all power ups these don't 
have to be used instantly but can be saved for 
later: before every level the player can choose 
the power ups he wants to bring with him. There 
are overall eight worlds with different themes 
which are represented by a overhead map. Sometimes 
there are different paths with other level and at 
the end of a world Master Higgins has to fight a 
boss.

Bugs Bunny & Lola Bunny - Operation Carrots (c) 
1998 Infogrames Europe SA / Infogrames Europe SA 
 
Looney Tunes: Carrot Crazy is a side scrolling 
platform game featuring famous Warner Bros. 
cartoon characters Bugs Bunny and Lola Bunny. 
After finding out all carrots have been stolen 
from their garden, as Bugs or Lola Bunny the 
player will have to investigate. Bugs will have to 
explore the Warner Bros. studio to find out who 
stole the carrots. 
 
Like many platform games you walk from left to 
right through a level. There are five different 
worlds which represent the surroundings of 
characters Yosemite Sam, Marvin the Martian, Daffy 
Duck, Elmer Fudd and the Tasmanian Devil. Each 
world is divided into several levels. The object 
of each level is to find all film clapboards 
present. 
 
Bugs and Lola can jump and hit things with a 
mallet (or rolling pin for Lola). They also both 
feature unique special abilities. Bugs Bunny can 
dig and move heavy chests and Lola can float down 
safely from large heights with her parasol. 
Players can switch between characters at any time. 
 
Power-ups in the game include carrots for energy 
required for special abilities, a super carrot 
that allows the player to fly like a helicopter 
(using his ears) and the habanero carrot, which 
makes the player invincible for a while. 
 
If you collect the letters EXTRA during the level 
you get to play a small minigame where you have to 
shoot firecrackers at moving targets. 
 
Each of the worlds ends with a showdown with the 
major character of that world. Usually this 
involves running from a vehicle that pursues the 
player, while avoiding obstacles.

Kyorochan Land (c) 1991 Hewson Consultants Ltd. / 
Triffix Entertainment Inc. 
 
You play a small green guy who needs to blow up 
eight towers, because their presence is somehow 
poisoning the water of planets which could 
potentially be ideal colonies. Unfortunately you 
need to get to the top of these towers to blow 
them up. 
 
You make your way up to the top of the tower via 
walkways around the outside of the towers. You 
need to jump over, kick, and run from various 
enemies in your journey to the top. Most vertical 
movement is achieved by jumping onto moving ledges 
at the right moment. 
 
The game was considered revolutionary in its time 
for its graphic technique. As the main character 
walked around the outside of the tower, the 
character was fixed in the middle of the screen 
while the tower itself rotated. This gave it a 
pseudo-3D effect. 
 
Towers are linked together via a voyage through 
the sea in your trusty MK.7 submarine. This plays 
out as a side-scrolling collect-'em-up in which 
bonus points can be obtained.

   1979 Nintendo Space Fever arcade game.

the character's head with a picture of your own. 
 
View allows you to look back at your pictures. You 
can also make short animations of all your 
pictures or share them with another Game Boy 
Camera. The accessory is designed as a cartridge 
with a camera on top, plugged into the Game Boy 
hand-held. The camera can only shoot 
black-and-white pictures. 
 
The start and select options let you doodle on 
your pictures and print them out with the Game Boy 
Printer.

Ishidou (c) Nov, 1990 Publishing International / 
ASCII Corporation 
 
Ishido is a solitaire board game played with tiles 
(like Shanghai).  The objective is to place all of 
the tiles onto the board and obtain the highest 
possible score by following specific rules of 
play.  It is a solitaire game.  There are ways to 
play that can dramatically increase the score, 
which makes the game very strategic in nature.  
Additionally, when desired, the player can get an 
oracle reading by asking a question...the question 
is answered when the player makes a very elegant 
play (4 way match). 
 
There is also a "construction set" where players 
can create their own tiles and backgrounds.  But 
the game comes with numerous tile sets and 
backgrounds.

Pocket Monsters Yellow (c) Oct, 1999 Creatures, 
Inc.|Game Freak, Inc.|Nintendo Co., Ltd. / 
Nintendo of America Inc. 
 
Pokémon Yellow, along with Pokémon Blue and 
Pokémon Red forms the first generation of Pokémon 
games.  You control a number of fictional animals 
known as Pokémon and must travel the land using 
your current Pokémon to defeat and capture more. 
 
There are 151 Pokémon that fall into various types 
such as fire, water and grass that have a 
complicated rock-paper-scissors relationship.  You 
come across a series of town, each of which 
contains a gym where you must do battle with other 
Pokémon trainers.  Each gym specializes in a 
different type of Pokémon.  After beating each 
gym, you are given a new ability that lets you 
travel to new areas. 
 
The object of the game is to defeat all eight gym 
leaders, or ultimately, to catch all the varieties 
of Pokémon.  Some of them are not actually 
catchable in Yellow, so you must use the Game Boy 
link function to trade with friends using Red and 
Blue to complete your collection. 
 
Pokémon Yellow differs from the other 
first-generation games because it is based on the 
Pokémon animé series.  The main character looks 
like Ash and he starts the game with Pikachu, 
rather than choosing a Pokémon as in all other 
games in the series.  Character graphics 
throughout the game are based on designs from the 
series and it includes Jesse, James and their 
Meowth, which the other games do not.
