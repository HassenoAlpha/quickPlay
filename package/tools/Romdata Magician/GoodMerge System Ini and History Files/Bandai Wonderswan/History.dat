You are a young man who lives in Japan and likes 
driving trucks. There is a competition of truck 
drivers who deliver goods all across the country. 
Willing to impress your girlfriend Yukie, you 
decide to participate in the races and to win the 
title of the best trucker in Japan. 
 
Dekotora is short for "decorated truck", and this 
racing game consists not only of driving your 
truck through the highway, trying to be faster 
than your rivals, but also of buying various stuff 
for your truck and decorating it. Depending on 
your results in the races, you can buy truck parts

Beat Mania (c) Apr 28, 1999 ICCE Japan / Konami 
Co., Ltd. 
 
This is a portable version of beatmania and as 
such it contains everything one could hope for in 
such a game, a series of music track (with 
reproduced vocals!), a lot of buttons to press, 
and a lot of vinyl to scratch. 
 
After you select the music you want to play you'll 
have a vertical scroll which will indicate when 
you should hit one of the left directional buttons 
along with the music. The game also indicates when 
you should 'scratch' which should be be familiar 
to anyone who has played a beatmania arcade game. 
This refers to the scratching of a record, one 
might think that the WonderSwan is ill-equiped for 
such a for of input, well think again! beatmania 
for WonderSwan included in its packaging a 
miniature record that could be fitted over the 
right directional keys to  make scratching more 
realistic. 
 
As you finish songs you'll on lock more difficult 
and interesting(?) tunes. The game plays 
vertically.

BUFFERS EVOLUTION (c) Dec 09, 1999 Bandai Co., 
Ltd. / Bandai Co., Ltd. 
 
In a post-apocalyptic future a gambling syndicate 
seeks to make a quick buck in the gritty remains 
of earth. By fusing the best of animal and 
mechanical traits they create three bestial 
androids from a bird, a lion, and a rhinoceros. 
Bets are taken and then the robots are loosed into 
hostile mazes of scrap metal on old earth. Maybe 
they'll even make it back alive... 
 
The goal of BUFFERS EVOLUTION is to run through a 
course while collecting ten parts in the best time 
possible. The courses are large and vary between 
jungle scenes, deserts, old factories, and general 
mechanical wastes. These areas are cased in by 
electricity to stop the contests from escaping and 
thereby ruining the entertainment of the masses. 
This will keep you in the bounds of the course. 
With the press of a button your character will 
momentarily turn into a 'buffer', a sharp pisiform 
metallic object, while being a buffer you can 
destroy enemies by slamming into them, this will 
often bounce you in a given direction, which is 
useful for reaching high ledges. 
 
Although you do not need to get all the parts to 
clear an area special items can be accrued by 
collection parts, while on the course proper these 
parts will heal any damage you may have taken. 
Perhaps if you collect all the part in all nine 
areas you'll have the means to escape you captors? 
 
Gameplay is reminiscent of Sonic the Hedghog 
although in those games you race against a 
countdown while here you are merely trying to get 
good times.

Crazy Climber (c) Jul 29, 1999 Nihon Bussan Co., 
Ltd. / Nihon Bussan Co., Ltd. 
 
As Crazy Climber, climb your way to the top of a 
series of buildings, where a helicopter is waiting 
to pick you up and take you to the next building. 
As Climber scales a building, he is able to climb 
up and sideways but he cannot climb down. 
While climbing a building, windows will open and 
close simultaneously. If any window closes on 
either of his hands he will lose his grip. 
However, if a window closes on both of his hands, 
he will fall to his death, resulting in the loss 
of a life. You have three Climbers in total, but 
you are awarded an extra Climber every 30,000 
points. Besides windows, Climber is faced with 
other dangers, including: 
 
1. Bald-headed guys who hurl various objects at 
   you. 
2. Pesky condors who fly by, dropping eggs and 
   droppings of an unpleasant substance. 
3. Falling steel girders and iron dumbells. 
4. Electrical "Nichibutsu" signs with a 
   dangling live wire. 
5. Falling "Crazy Climber" signs. 
6. King Kong leaping from side to side of the 
   building and slams his hands against the 
   windows. 
 
The climber must try to avoid or overcome each of 
those hazards which he will encounter as he 
continues climbing in his attempt to reach the 
rooftop. If he falls to his death by windows or 
objects,  another climber will replace him and 
will start at the same location where the last one 
fell. The specific danger will not be present at 
the same point, so the climber can go further up 
to face the next danger. Most of the hazards are 
announced by certain recognizable musical themes. 
 
Crazy Climber is awarded a bonus score on each 
building every time after getting carried off by 
the helicopter. However, each bonus score will 
decrease by every ten seconds that the climber 
will spend scaling each building as he attempts 
reach the top. Somewhere in the game, there is 
"The Lucky Balloon", which can lift Climber about 
ten stories and raise the player's bonus score if 
he catches it.

Digimon Adventure 02 - Tag Tamers (c) Aug 03, 2000 
SIMS Co., Ltd. / Bandai Co., Ltd. 
 
The game is based on the manga series Digimon, in 
which children can travel to a digital world and 
help good digital monsters to defeat evil ones. In 
this game, the two heroes, Ryou and Ken, are 
summoned to the Digiworld to fight against the 
archenemy Millenniumon and his side-kick 
Diablomon. Upon defeating the two evil monsters 
once again, the heroes realize that Millenniumon 
has taken a different shape and is reborn to 
conquer the Digiworld anew. Now you must recruit 
digital monsters and lead them into the ultimate 
battle. 
 
The gameplay follows traditional Digimon outlines: 
you descend into dungeons and have your monster 
friends fight other monsters in turn-based combat. 
Upon returning to the town, you can make those 
monsters participate in future battles. Unlike the 
two previous Digimon Adventure games,  Anode and  
Cathode Tamers, you cannot move over the battle 
field.

Digimon Adventure - Anode Tamer (c) Dec 15, 1999 
SIMS Co., Ltd. / Bandai Co., Ltd. 
 
The game is based on the popular manga series 
Digimon, which follows the adventures of children 
who can gain access into the digital world and 
fight digital monsters there. In this game, the 
evil Milenniamon has kidnapped several children 
and is planning to take control over the 
Digiworld. One of the good monsters, Agumon, 
escaped, and transported the hero Ryou to the 
Digiworld. Now Ryou has to fight monsters, capture 
them, and assemble an army to overthrow 
Milenniamon and to rescue his friends. 
 
The gameplay involves mainly hunting monsters in 
dungeons and then sending them to fight other 
monsters. In the town you can buy supplies and 
take care of your monsters. The battles are 
turn-based, and you can move freely over the 
battle field. Once a contact with an enemy is 
initiated, an automatic battle sequence follows.

Digimon Adventure - Cathode Tamer (c) Jan 20, 2000 
SIMS Co., Ltd. / Bandai Co., Ltd. 
 
This is the second game in Digimon Adventure 
series, a kind of an add-on to  Anode Tamer. The 
game is based on the popular manga Digimon. The 
hero, a boy named Ryou, has to travel to digital 
world in order to free his friends from the 
clutches of the evil digital monster Milenniamon. 
 
The story of this game is identical to that of 
"Anode Tamer", and gameplay mechanics are exactly 
the same: you descend into dungeons to fight 
monsters in turn-based style, capture the monsters 
after the battles and then send them to fight new 
ones. The difference between the two games are the 
monsters themselves: "Cathode Tamers" features a 
brand new set of monsters, and since the beginning 
of the game you encounter different foes. The full 
collection of monsters can be achieved only if you 
complete both games.

inside a wheel, or ask it whether it is hungry or 
not. You can feed it some typical hamster food, 
clean the cage from time to time, and even write 
e-mails to your hamster. Depending on your actions 
the disposition of the hamster will change.

May 02, 1999 Ludic / Bandai Co., Ltd. 
 
The raven has made a friend. But sorrow be to this 
raven, for this fellow avian migrates, and will 
not return for seasons. Filled with sadness and 
regret the raven takes wing. As he soars through 
his lonely world his tears begin to fall... and 
water dying flowers. At last he knows what he must 
do until his friend returns, he will make new 
friends in the flowers. He will help them grow and 
spread their seeds. 
 
Each level in Tane wo Maku Tori contains four 
pillars bridged by a series of horizontal or 
vertical rows. These rows are different for each 
of the three spaces formed by the pillar. The rows 
may be moved up and down, one set at a time. At 
the foot of a column, up to three in harder areas, 
will be a nascent flower. Water drops will fall 
along the path of the pillars, which will have a 
different theme for each level, and eventually 
either fall onto the ground or a flower. Water 
drops will always move along a bridge if it 
intersects their path, drops can't go up 
diagonals. Drops an combine to create larger 
faster moving drops. Any more than three drops and 
it will simply fall off the pillar, or bridge, and 
be of no use. 
 
When a flower gets enough rain drops, or tear 
drops, it will bloom, when all the flowers on the 
stage bloom it will be cleared. 
 
Enemies also roam the stage, gobbling up hydrogen 
based solution and plants. They follow the same 
laws as the drops and will move along beams when 
encountered, however they can go up vertical 
beams. Should one reach a flower it will nibble at 
it until dead. This ends the game

and rod that might be most appropriate for the 
environment. The player then selects where to want 
to stand on the shore and then the ideal location 
for a cast. 
 
The view then switches to a closer overhead of the 
body of water and the player's avatar. A power 
meter sways over head and should the play manage 
to stop the meter at just the right point he will

Ganso Jajamaru Kun (c) Apr 15, 1999 Jaleco Ltd. / 
Jaleco Ltd. 
 
Ganso JaJaMaru-kun is a remake of the NES 
platformer Ninja JaJaMaru-kun. It includes new 
levels and bosses that stretch the gameplay in 
novel ways. 
 
Lord Namazu Dayuu has kidnapped JaJaMaru-kun's 
beloved Princess Sakura. This piratical lord is no 
laughing matter, despite his sadistically gleeful 
disposition, he possess an army of creatures drawn 
from Japanese folklore to prevent you from 
reuniting with your princess ever again. 
 
The game is quite simple and plays, for the most 
part, much like its predecessor. Jajamaru-kun 
begins on the bottom of a three tiered horizontal 
field. On each level of this field there are two 
enemies on each tier. The tiers have weak brick 
points in that Jajamaru-kun can break by hitting 
them with his head while, a common trait for 
arcade heroes. Once a passage is made Jajamaru-kun 
can move through them as can enemies. To clear a 
level all enemies must be defeated, most enemies 
can be killed by having a shuriken thrown at them, 
the only weapon available without a power-up, some 
need to be stunned either by falling through a 
hole in a tier or by being jumped on. Enemy 
projectiles can also be canceled out by the 
shuriken. Being touched by an enemy projectile, or 
in a few cases an enemies body, will instantly 
kill Jajamaru-kun. After an enemy has been killed 
its spirit will ascend, you can grab this for 
extra points. 
 
Each of these stages has a leader who will posses 
some special attribute and present a new sprite. 
After the level in which the leader appears 
he/she/it will show up in the following levels as 
a standard level enemy often a bit weaker. Each 
stage gives you two minutes to complete it, except 
bosses and special stages. When about one minute 
remains Lord Namazu will send an orb of fire onto 
the stage that will slowly home after 
Jajamaru-kun. 
 
You start the game with two extra lives and three 
continues. More lives can be found in the game, or 
by accruing points. 
 
There are four levels in each game area, village, 
graveyard, castle and town, seaside and ship, and 
the hidden island. However it is not enough to 
kill all the enemies in a stage to progress to the 
next area. Each level has its a cherry blossom 
that will descend from the top of the screen at a 
certain point. If you should kill all the enemies 
before the blossom arrives or the blossom floats 
of the bottom of the screen you'll go onto the 
next level but have to return to get it later, in 
this case all the enemies will have returned. 
Collecting all four cherry blossoms will allow you 
to go onto a special stage and the area boss. 
 
Each game area has one special stage. These stages 
use the familiar tiers but now they scroll upwards 
and are littered with traps and hazards

Go Raku Ou Tango! is a simple word game mimicking 
the puzzles found in the pages of popular printed 
Japanese word-puzzle publisher Sekai Bunka. These 
puzzles consist of taking words writing in English

Katakana, and moving tiles around beneath the 
word(s) to recreate them in a different writing 
style. There are several variants on this 
gameplay. 
 
There is a story mode featuring a family of 
archaeologists who are digging up Japanese 
orthography across the globe. Sweden, for 
instance, is known not only as being the home of 
lost Atlantis but also troves of buried Japanese 
writing! A family member is missing perhaps there 
will be clues in this the ruins of these global 
ancient Japanese ruins? By completing the puzzles 
you will get to see a scene and a new more

Graduation (c) Dec 16, 1999 Bandai Visual Co., 
Ltd.|Image Works / Bandai Co., Ltd. 
 
Graduation is a Japanese anime "life-sim" game 
which are popular in Japan. Except for 
Princessmaker 2, which was never officially 
released, this is the only game of its type that I 
know of which was ever translated to English. 
 
In Graduation you take the role of a homeroom 
teacher who is given the responsibility of 
teaching five girls in their last year of high 
school. You determine their class schedules, do 
guidance counseling, interfere with their weekend 
plans, and occasionally take to the streets to 
make sure they're not getting into trouble. Each 
of the girls have their own individual personality 
and problems, and the choices you make will 
determine whether they graduate from high school, 
what they do with their lives afterwards, and 
whether or not they wind up hating your guts. Get 
them all into top colleges and your boss will 
praise your genius. If they all flunk or wind up 
wanting to marry you, you'll obviously be fired. 
 
Despite what common sense and knowledge of the 
Japanese psyche might lead you to believe, this is 
not an adult (or hentai) game and there's no 
nudity and only an average amount of anime 
sexploitation.

The Bungeling Empire has stolen a huge cache of 
gold from its rightful owners, and your mission is 
to infiltrate its treasury and recapture it. This 
entails progressing through 150 screens of 
platforms, ladders and ropes. 
 
The Empire has sent robotic guards down to protect 
the gold, and contact with any of these will cost 
you a life. Your method of escaping them is to 
press fire to dig a hole in their line of 
movement, thus causing them to fall in briefly, 
allowing you to move across the gap safely. Once 
all the gold has been collected, a ladder allowing 
you to move onto the next screen is added. 
Completing these screens often requires forward 
planning and precision.

Aug 05, 1999 Tomcat System / Bandai Co., Ltd. 
 
Conan Edogawa is the pseudonym of Shin'ichi Kudo, 
but more than just a pseudonym, a pseudoform. 
Shin'ichi Kudo, an inquisitive seventeen year old 
student, was investigating a blackmail case when 
attacked by members of the Black Organization. He 
was forced to take an experimental APTX 4869 drug 
which caused, in a rare side-effect, his body to 
transform into that of a seven-year-old. 
 
This does not stop Shin'ichi, adopting the name 
Conan Edogawa he moves in with Ran Mori, his 
childhood friend and sweetheart. Enrolling in a 
elementary school to complete his disguise he vows 
to find out who is backing the Black Organization, 
and to have his revenge. With the help of his his 
oddball classmates, an ex-member of the Black 
Organization Ai Haibara, whose also been turned 
into a child, and his beloved he just might do 
it... 
 
The games story follows the Conan through his 
school life which intertwines with his search for 
justice. He forms a Junior Detective League in his 
school to help him out. This cast of characters 
will help supply you information throughout the 
game. 
 
The gameplay consists of using a map screen to 
travel to a number of areas collecting clues for 
the case you are on. Each area offers you the 
ability to examine the area, talk to bystanders, 
collect items, and sometimes attack if a threat is 
apparent. 
 
After collecting information you will have the 
chance to open your notebook, which will cause the 
WonderSwan to switch to a vertical orientation, 
and review your information. Also in the note 
books is a logic grid. On the grid you will have 
to select where you've deduced something 
intersects,who was at the scene at what time, by 
marking it with a circle and voiding all 
impossibilities with crosses. Once you've 
completed an entire grid you'll be able to present 
your deductions or press a point further allowing 
you to progress. If you've gotten your reasoning 
wrong, however, it is back to the drawing board 
and time to recheck you evidence and maybe time to 
see if you missed some clues. 
 
This game includes five scenarios, roughly 
translated to English as: 
 
1. Continuous high school girl kidnapping 
2. Murder on the suspense drama set 
3. Jack the Ripper murder 
 
The mysteries incident's letter of notice 
4. Treasure cases at the end of the century

New features include finding keys. Keys represent 
actual bits of evidence you can use to solve the 
logic puzzles in the game once you find all the 
keys you will be able to attempt to solve the 
puzzle. However, often in the search for keys one 
finds hints. Hints are bits of information that 
will point you in the right direction of a key. 
Hints also be presented, singularly or combined, 
to various people in an attempt to extract 
information, or keys. Once you have all the keys 
you will be able to have an entire logic grid, 
otherwise there will be grayed out areas on the 
grid. 
 
There is also now a mode in some cases where Conan 
will have to chase the suspect through several 
areas before subduing him. 
 
The game records your information at the start of 
the game to work a character based off of you into 
the game. This character can be swapped with other 
owners of 
Meitantei Conan: Nishi no Meitantei Saidai no Kiki

Mingle Magnet (c) Nov 02, 1999 HAL Laboratory, 
Inc. / HAL Laboratory, Inc. 
 
Mingle Magnet is a simple puzzle game of the 
falling block variety. The player oversees a 10 x 
10 square field where the first four rows (three 
on easy) have been filled by blocks. Each block 
shows one of three symbols, a dark gray circle, a 
light gray circle, and a white circle. When ever 
any of blocks with matching symbols touch they 
will form a link. By moving the cursor over a 
chain and clicking on it the player will be given 
points based on its size on the chain will be 
removed. The goal is to get a large score while 
making sure that new pieces can still enter the 
field. Once no more pieces can enter the game 
ends. Blocks fall at the same time one square 
apart, when the next set of blocks fall they will 
occupy the space given by the previous drop. 
 
The "magnet" aspect of Mingle Magnet come into 
play in how the player can control the placement 
of the blocks. All the blocks are attracted to a 
magnet which, although not seen, can be placed on 
any side of the field. All blocks will be drawn to 
the magnet. For example, if one has the magnet at 
the south of the field and then puts it to the 
north what was the top of the block pile will now 
be the bottom, and blocks will fall onto what was 
the bottom. The direction of the magnet is 
indicated by a magnetic field animation behind the 
action. 
 
This game is played vertically.

feudal states, each ruled by a daimyo. These 
daimyos would often go to war with each other. 
Many dreamt of conquering the land, becoming the 
Shogun and ruling the entire country. One of those 
daimyos was the ambitious Nobunaga Oda, a 
merciless ruler and a renowned strategist. Players 
take on the role of Nobunaga Oda or one of many 
other daimyos to try to conquer Japan. 
 
Nobunaga's Ambition is a turn-based strategy game 
which can be played in different modes. Gameplay 
is similar to Koei's better known Romance of the 
Three Kingdoms game. Players begin by selecting 
either a 17 regions scenario or a larger 50 
scenario. Then, the player must select a daimyo, 
each of which is rated attributes in several

Pocket Fighter is a crossover fighting game that 
takes characters from the Street Fighter, 
Darkstalkers, and Red Earth fighting series, and 
presents them in a cute shrunken chibi form with 
ridiculous moves and costumes. The games fights 
take place in various Capcom locations. 
 
At the top of the screen is your, and your 
opponents, health bar. Below that is a meter 
showing how many gems you've collected. Gems are 
produced from a character when they are hit by a 
kick or a punch, these gems will then lie on the 
ground until someone picks them up. Filling up 
your gem gauge will increase your special attack 
meters on the bottom of the screen. Ideally one 
aims to achieve a special attack level of 9 by 
picking up gems, however, battle will often having 
you using these up before you reach that lofty 
number. 
 
The main difference between the Sega Saturn and 
PlayStation version of Pocket Fighter is a card 
battle mode. 
 
In the card battle mode you will be presented with 
a set of three to six cards to choose from to form 
an attack, after which you'll view the combat and 
get new cards to pick from until one player is 
K.O.'ed 
 
The cards will have a attack power and a defense 
power. By combing cards you'll get an attack, 
defense, and counter value 
which determine an overall power value. The player 
who has selected the higher power value will 
attack that turn, unless your foe has picked a 
guard card, an evasion card, or a high enough 
counter value. Other cards include recovery cards 
and special move cards. 
 
"Collectible Cards", cards featuring various 
graphics of the game's characters, can be obtained 
by playing the games various modes, such as 
"Arcade", and traded via the Communication Cable 
 
The game also featured an online high score board 
through the WonderGate.

Rainbow Islands - Putty's Party (c) Jun 29, 2000 
MegaHouse Corporation / TAKARA Co., Ltd. 
 
A spin-off of the Rainbow Islands games, this 
title features Putty instead of the classic Bub & 
Bob. Like the previous games set on the island the 
character's main tools and weapons are rainbows. 
These rainbows can be walked on to scale heights 
or cover gaps. Rainbows can also be used to kill 
enemies by striking them with the arc as it is 
created, or after it has taken form jumping on it 
so that it breaks and the shards rain death on 
those below. Enemies can also be trapped in 
rainbows. Enemies killed by rainbow shards will 
sometimes drop a special item or a gem. A series 
of gems are needed to properly clear each level. 
 
The goal of each area, aside from collecting gems, 
is to scale to the top of the island. Islands are 
made out of a series of themed platforms covered 
with associated enemies. These areas are scattered 
with items, mostly food, that will increase your 
score. Sometimes a rainbow will dislodge hidden 
food or an enemy will drop some when killed. If 
your score is high enough you will start to  send 
out more than one rainbow at a time. At the end of 
each island there will be a boss. If you fulfilled 
certain requirements in the level you may get a 
special item. 
 
The islands in this game are, here listed with 
their theme: 
 
1. Insect Island: Insects and nature 
2. Monster Island: Classic horror monsters 
3. Doh Island: Geometric 
4. Darius Island: Machines

Slither Link (c) Apr 20, 2000 Tomcat System / 
Bandai Co., Ltd.|Nikoli Co., Ltd. 
 
Slither Link is a fiendishly simple puzzle game 
from the pages of the Nikoli puzzle magazine. 
While Nikoli is widely known for coining the 
puzzle name Sudoku they also have produced a 
myriad of puzzles often dealing with numbers. 
 
In this puzzle the player needs to create a loop 
around the fields grid with out having the loop's 
line cross itself. This would of course present 
little challenge if it weren't for those pesky 
numbers. The field is dotted with numerals that 
signal how many times the line may be next to it. 
The number one may only have the line contiguous 
with it on one side, the two two sides, the three 
three side. Four of course does not exist as that 
would, by a requirement to have four sides, create 
a square and thus a intersection of the line. 
Zeros also exist these may not have any lines 
bordering them at all. 
 
When a loop has been created so that all numbers 
are 'touched' appropriately and the line make a 
full loop you've cleared the puzzle. The game 
possesses six levels of difficulty and is played 
vertically on the WonderSwan.

curse. Kirie finds this hard to believe, so 
Shuichi brings up a grim family anecdote.

every thing with a spiral, ending with bizarre 
spiral self mutilation leading to his death.

A nervous Kirie goes back into her everyday school 
world but things seem strange... Spirals that are 
part of the mundane world suddenly take on a new 
threatening life. A whorl of hair, a jack in a 
box, a scar, a plate, metaphorical spirals, love, 
hate, madness lurks in Kurôzu-Cho 
 
The game is essentially a black and white manga. 
During the story you will make choices for Kirie

Dicing Knight Period (c) May 31, 2004 Platine 
Dispositif / Qute 
 
Dicing Knight. follows the journey of a nameless 
knight fighting through a series of randomly 
generated dungeons.  The game will start on the 
floor of a dungeon, your goal being to find the 
floors key to progress to the next floor. 
Eventually you will reach a dungeon boss, after 
you beat it you’ll be allowed access to a new more 
difficult dungeon. Dungeons are timed by a “Food 
Gauge” which when depleted will force you to exit 
the dungeon. 
 
The dungeons are named: 
 
1. Lindwurm - German term for dragon, meant to 
   establish the mythic setting. This dungeon has 
   a heavenly aura. 
2. Shootingstar - A fiery land that will start 
   to test your knowledge of the controls from 
   Lindwurm. 
3. Jabberwock - A whimsical land that is bathed 
   in night. When the night shall end is unknown. 
4. Quetzalcoatl - The area named for the Aztec 
   sky god and creator. The entire map can no 
   longer be seen. 
5. Jörmungandr - The serpent that shall kill 
   Thor. This stage is a mythic earthy setting. 
 
The A button swings your sword and the B rings up 
your shield, the key items of any knight. Slashing 
your foes with your sword and devouring 
projectiles with your shield will increase your 
special meter, which when filled will allow you to 
perform a deadly special attack “Shining Sword” or 
"Blazing Sword". 
 
One interesting features of Dicing Knight is the 
“dicing” every time you attack an enemy dice will 
pop out of it and roll, you’ll deal damage to the 
foe based on the rolls you get. Likewise when you 
are hit dice also roll to determine you’re 
damaged. 
 
The Y buttons will be mapped to four different 
items, which can be found inside your foes. A 
variety of items are included in the game such as 
an item that will predict or alter dice rolls, a 
variety of stat altering potions, invincibility 
items,  and a drill that will let you progress 
through dungeon wall to avoid monster filled 
rooms. Various orbs are also obtainable, via a 
lottery system, which will improve your abilities. 
 
After you beat the game on “Knight Mode” you’ll 
obtain a, “Fortuner Mode”, which will alter the 
game play, keeping the dungeon crawling style but 
giving you the ability to shoot to you and more of 
the monsters. The A button will be transformed 
into a double pistol, and the B will lob grenades. 
As well as two new specials that allow you to 
absorb enemy bullets or do a powerful shock

Digimon Tamers - Digimon Medley (c) Jul 12, 2001 
Shade, Inc. / Bandai Co., Ltd. 
 
"Digimon Medley" is based on the popular manga and 
and animé series Digimon, in which ordinary 
Japanese children find a way into a digital world, 
where they help good digital monsters fight 
against evil ones. The game is not directly 
plot-related to  Digimon Adventure or Digimon 
Tamers: Brave Tamer games. Instead, it follows 
more closely the actual episodes of the series. 
You play as various characters, such as the main 
hero Taichi and his friend Yamato from the first 
episodes, as well as heroes from the Digimon 
Tamers sub-series: Takato, Ruki, and Lee. The game 
is divided into short episodes, each one of which 
revives one of the battles in the series. You 
start with Digimon Tamers, as they venture into 
the DigiWorld, only to meet the enigmatic digimon 
named Impmon, who is up to some mischief. 
 
Each episode can be played as one of several 
available characters. Each character also has 
his/her own digimon who fights all the battles. 
The battles are random and occur while you are 
navigating your heroes through top-down dungeons. 
The attacks are displayed as short animé-style 
sequences. During your turn, you must press the A 
button repeatedly to increase the power of your 
attack. The enemy attacks simultaneously, and you 
have to invest enough power in your attack in 
order for it to connect.

This is the third in Bandai's "hamster simulation" 
series. In this game, you are the "master" of a 
hamster. The game flows in real time, but you can 
interfere and perform various actions. The hamster 
has its own room in a house, with a table and a 
wheel. There are many things you can do with the 
hamster. You can take in to a stroll in the 
forest, go shopping with it, make it play with a 
ball, and so on. You can also perform actions 
unrelated to the hamster, like re-decorating the 
house or writing and painting on a piece of paper. 
The game features a point-and-click interface: you 
move your cursor over an object (such as hamster 
or calendar), which brings up an action menu.

Square Co., Ltd. 
 
Hironobu Sakaguchi's Final Fantasy... the first of 
one of the longest role-playing game series known 
to mankind. Final Fantasy is the game for the NES 
console that started it all. 
 
The world is veiled in darkness. Winds don't blow, 
the seas are stormy, and the earth rots. All 
people can hope for is that the ancient prophecy 
will be finally fulfilled. "When the world is 
veiled in darkness, four warriors will come..." 
And indeed, they come - the four characters you 
have previously chosen. Their first quest is to 
free a princess from the evil Garland, and then 
the real journey begins... 
 
Final Fantasy is played with an adventuring party 
rather than with a single character. Before the 
game starts, the player chooses four characters 
from six different classes: Fighter, Thief, Black 
Belt, White Mage, Red Mage, and Black Mage. Which 
four classes the player chooses for his characters 
is entirely up to him. He also gives the 
characters names. 
 
In the game, the party walks around in a top-down 
world, visits cities, caves, palaces and other 
places to buy equipment, rest and get hints and 
new quests, and fights baddies when they are 
encountered. Final Fantasy uses a turn-based 
combat system

Final Fantasy II (c) Mar 28, 2002 Square Co., Ltd. 
/ Square Co., Ltd. 
 
This is the fourth entry in the  Final Fantasy 
series. It was known as Final Fantasy II 
internationally, because the  second and third 
games were never released outside of Japan. 
 
The military country of Baron is one of the 
strongest in the land, with a proud army and a 
majestic air force known as the Red Wings. But, 
while their armies are kind and loyal, the recent 
actions of the King are anything but. The young 
Captain of the Red Wings, Cecil, is ordered to 
steal a crystal from a village of innocent 
magicians, and when he questions the actions of 
his King, Cecil is immediately thrown out of the 
country and sent off to kill strange monsters. 
Little does he realize the price the King's 
actions will pay, and what the true secret of the 
crystals, and their powers, truly is... 
 
This is the first Final Fantasy game that 
introduced the famous ATB (active-time battle) 
system: during the battles, you have a time 
indicator for each party member that tells you 
when this character is able to act. If it takes 
you too long to select a command for this 
character, the enemy will act without waiting for 
your turn. The game abandons the job system that 
was implemented in the  first and the  third game 
in favor of pre-set character classes (paladin, 
white mage, ninja, etc.) assigned to each party 
member. 
 
The PlayStation version adds a new rendered intro 
and ending.

choose, the goal stays the same: Increase your 
experience points and abilities by defeating many 
varied enemies through-out the land. 
 
Much like the FF series of old (and new), you can 
choose members to join your party and the quest 
that lies ahead (either warriors, mutants or 
creatures). Every character has a limit to the 
amount of moves available during every battle and 
experience points are gained after each fight, 
increasing stamina, power, etc.

Works Co., Ltd. / Sammy Corporation 
 
The game takes place in 22th century. Scientists 
developed a new technique that allowed them to 
merge the DNA of humans and animals, producing 
powerful creatures known as "gears". The 
characters of the game participate in a 
tournament, the winner of which would face a gear 
who went out of control and is threatening to lead 
a gear rebellion against the humans. The game 
allows you to play as familiar characters from 
Guilty Gear series, such as the main hero Sol 
Badguy, who has a certain connection to the gears, 
and his rival, the leader of the Holy Knights 
named Ky Kiske. It also introduces a new 
character, the nurse Fanny, who fights with a 
syringe and has a mysterious connection to the 
genius surgeon, and later serial murderer, Dr. 
Baldhead. 
 
"Guilty Gear Petit" is a 2D fighting game. The 
story mode lets you pick a character and take 
him/her through a series of fights, while in time 
attack mode you can choose your opponents freely. 
The graphics are done in "super-deformed" style. 
The game retains key ingredients of Guilty Gear 
gameplay, such as building tension in order to 
execute powerful attacks, combo moves, etc.

Guilty Gear Petit 2 (c) Sep 27, 2001 Arc System 
Works Co., Ltd. / Sammy Corporation 
 
In 22th century, scientists found a way to create 
artificial beings whom they called "gears". These 
gears were very powerful, but did not have wills 
of their own, and were completely obedient to the 
humans. However, a gear named Justice was able to 
free himself from the control and led a rebellion 
against the humans. Since then, the humanity lived 
in fear that the gears will one day gain the power 
on the Earth. For that purpose, the Sacred Order 
of the Holy Knights organized fighting tournaments 
to find out who is strong enough to face the 
renegade gears. 
 
"Guilty Gear Petit 2" is very similar to its  
predecessor, having the same "super-deformed" 
graphical style, battle moves (including the 
tension system to accumulate power and combo 
attacks), as well as backgrounds for battles. 
Several new characters appear in "Guilty Gear 
Petit 2", such as Zato-1, the former head of the 
assassin guild, the pirate captain Johnny, the 
time traveler Axl Lou from the 20th century, the 
mysterious Faust, and others.

Hanjyuku Hero - Aah Sekai yo Hanjuku Nare (c) Feb

Hanjuku Eiyu is set in a semi-comical universe 
called the Egg World, populated by two nations: 
Hanjuku and Kanjuku, or soft-boiled and 
hard-boiled eggs, respectively. You take the role 
of the commander of the Hanjuku army, and your 
goal is to guide it successfully through a series 
of events (called "tales"), capturing enemy 
castles and defeating the bosses of the Kanjuku 
army. 
 
This is a real-time war strategy game. The game 
time is divided into months, each month taking a 
few minutes of real time. You control the hero and 
his generals, each one commanding units of foot 
soldiers. You send your army commanders through 
the world map to capture enemy castles. Once all 
the castles are captured, a new construction 
appears on the map, where the level boss resides, 
and your final goal in the chapter (tale) is to 
defeat this boss. Once you run into an enemy, an 
automatic battle sequence occurs, which you can 
interrupt, assigning commands to your army. Both 
Hanjuku and Kanjuku armies can summon powerful 
creatures called Egg Monsters, who can fight 
against a whole army or against each other in 
turn-based combat. Each month a "monthly event" 
occurs, such as changes in the land, earthquake, 
etc. Random events also pop out, during which you 
can buy supplies for your army.

of about ten sub areas. Scores are awarded based 
on kill ratio and completion time. New modes and 
easter eggs will be unlocked as you obtain higher

Various button combos will avoid certain 
obstacles, although a "one-button" easy mode is

rocket one can jump on and ride a short distance, 
others can merely be kicked out of the way or 
jumped over. 
 
Occasionally a crown will appear over an obstacle, 
if you successfully clear it you will briefly soar 
over the stage avoiding anything that might have 
been in your path. This is especially common 
before obstacles that might require outlandish 
button combos.

Yakusoku no Chi Riviera (c) Jan 12, 2002 Sting, 
Inc. / Bandai Co., Ltd. 
 
Riviera: The Promised Land is a turn based role 
playing game. It follows a traditional RPG formula 
- once peaceful land now ravaged by demons and 
their wars with angels. However, it also 
incorporates a "dating sim" as a subplot where 
your character must win affection of another 
character. 
 
It has similarities to Fire Emblem, Final Fantasy 
Tactics, Golden Sun and a number of others. 
Reaching high levels is important to make the game 
not too difficult at the end. The levelling up is 
similar to Secret of Mana, where the weapon skill 
for a character increases at a different rate to 
the character levels.

Romancing SaGa (c) Dec 20, 2001 Square Co., Ltd. / 
Square Co., Ltd. 
 
Once upon a time, three evil gods fought against 
the holy gods, and the holy God-Father chose a 
human warrior to help them. Finally, after a 
prolonged, terrible war, the leader of the three 
evil gods - Death, the eldest of them - 
surrendered. The youngest evil god, Schirach, 
became a human and has lost her powers. The middle 
one, Saruin, was sealed away in the dark world. 
Now, after thousand years have passed, and the 
seal of Saruin has weakened, it is time for you, 
the hero of the new generation, to defeat him. 
 
Romancing SaGa is the fourth installment in the 
long SaGa series - non-linear role-playing games 
with several main heroes. It is the first of three 
Super Nintendo entries. The first three games in 
the series were on the Gameboy and were known as 
"Final Fantasy Legend" outside of Japan. In this 
game, you play the stories of eight characters, 
which will later unite to face the ultimate evil. 
The eight characters belong to different classes 
and have different abilities. There are four male 
characters (noble son, thief, adventurer, and 
pirate), and four female ones (nomad, ranger, 
dancer, and savage). The combat is turn-based, 
with enemies visible on screen. Taking a cue from 
Final Fantasy II on the NES, instead of "Leveling" 
your character as a whole you level specific 
abilities such as a type of weapon or magic, as 
well as, stats such as HP and Strength and 
Intelligence. New to this entry abilities are 
randomly unlocked during battle as a light-bulb 
appears over the characters head and the new 
ability is unleashed to the surprise of friend and 
foe. This serendipitous element of gameplay along 
with the multiple heroes to choose from greatly 
enhance the replay value as no two playthroughs 
are alike. Which is good considering the steep 
learning curve of the SaGa games which require 
multiple playthroughs to truly master the system. 
 
"Romancing SaGa" was never released outside of 
Japan until the Playstation 2 remake "Romancing 
SaGa: Minstrel Song"

Wild Card (c) Mar 29, 2001 Square Co., Ltd. / 
Square Co., Ltd. 
 
Although made by  Square, the famous Japanese RPG 
developer, "Wild Card" is a game that is very 
different from classic Asian RPGs. Most 
importantly, it is not story-driven. The game is 
based entirely on quests which are not connected 
by a story arc. You play a nameless character with 
no background and there is no plot information or 
development beside your own progress with the 
quests. The gameplay consists entirely of playing 
cards. In the beginning of the game, an enigmatic 
woman named Maria asks you a series of questions, 
to determine the cards you get. After that, your 
character begins an adventure in a town. 
Locations, other characters, inventory, your 
movement - everything appears in form of cards. To 
get quests, you must choose your correspondent 
cards when encountering different people. You can 
buy weapons and equipment, and also fight enemies 
in turn-based combat by choosing the cards from 
your deck. You gain levels and become stronger in 
a traditional RPG fashion.

With You Mitsumete Itai (c) Jan 25, 2001 Cocktail 
Soft / Shall Luck 
 
With You is an adventure game with static 
graphics, in which the game advances as you choose 
what to do from a list of possible actions. Long 
time ago, a man and a woman made a promise, 
stating that although they were destined to be 
lonely souls, they should always remain together. 
But by a cruel joke of fate, they were separated 
and sealed into two jewels that were hidden for 
generations. Manami, who left the country 6 years 
before, has found one of the jewels while 
traveling. He will return to Japan to meet with 
their friends from childhood. This will entail a 
meeting of the two jewels again, for the second 
jewel seems to be owned by his father.

Wizardry - Scenario 1 - Kyounou no Shiren Jou (c) 
Mar 01, 2003 Sir-tech Software, Inc. / Bandai Co., 
Ltd. 
 
The first Wizardry game was one of the original 
CRPG dungeon crawlers, and stands along with  
Ultima and  Might & Magic as one of the defining 
staples of the genre. You generate and control a 
party of up to six different adventurers and send 
them into a 3D vector dungeon to fight monsters 
and find treasure. 
 
The game takes place in the domain of Trebor, the 
titular Mad Overlord. Trebor was once only 
power-mad, but went off the deep end after he 
acquired a magical amulet of immense power only to 
have it stolen from him by his nemesis the evil 
archmage Werdna. Werdna, not quite sure how to use 
the amulet properly, accidentally causes an 
earthquake which creates a ten-level dungeon 
beneath Trebor's castle. To avoid looking silly, 
Werdna declares the dungeon to be the new lair for 
him and his monster hordes. Trebor, not to be 
outdone, declares the labyrinth is in fact his new 
Proving Grounds where adventurers must prove 
themselves for membership in his elite honor guard 
(and incidentally retrieve his amulet in the 
process). Thus your goal in the game is to descend 
to the tenth floor of the labyrinth, defeat 
Werdna, and retrieve the fabled amulet.

Wonder Classic (c) Jan 18, 2001 Namco Limited / 
Bandai Co., Ltd. 
 
Wonder Classic is a golfing game where you will 
use different characters with specific abilities 
to your advantage. For example the character, 
Reiko Nagase nullifies the effects of wind, most 
others have certain benefits to certain types of 
shot. There are two starting characters and 
twenty-two unlockable and downloadable characters. 
 
The game consists of the following modes: 
 
1. Training: play whatever field you like as 
   long as you like. 
 
2. Character Get: you'll challenge your way 
   through ten golfers, after you beat them you'll 
   be able to play as them elsewhere in the game 
 
3. Stroke: play against the score 
 
4. Match: play by hole, each time golfer gets a 
   hole he will go "1UP" while his opponent will 
   go "1DOWN". Whoever is "UP" in the end wins. If 
   the "DOWN" player cannot win given the number 
   of remaining holes then the game will end. 
 
5. Mini Battle: Driving Contest: a match 
   contest where the golfers will only drive. 
 
6. Mini Battle: Near-Pin: a match contest that 
   will involve only shots near the pin. 
 
7. Mini Course: you play on a 3-par 9 hole 
   course, you may play against a computer if you 
   so wish. 
 
8. Tour: 32 contestants enter the tour, who 
   will win? You'll have to hone your Wonder 
   Classic golfing skills to best this. Winning in 
   tour mode will unlock new courses. 
 
9. Net Tour: this mode will allow you the 
   download the best 32 Tour scores that have been 
   uploaded via the WonderGate. And then play a 
   tour against those people, not the real people 
   but against their scores, in a tour. You can 
   also upload you own scores to compare them 
   online. 
 
The gameplay of Wonder Classic includes the 
ability to use the Y-buttons to augment just how 
your club will come in contact with the ball, to 
subtlety alter its trajectory. You'll also have 
six "Power Shots" which will have to be carefully 
conserved in each match. 
 
Using the WonderGate you could get new clubs as 
well as stat altering equipment, such as gloves. 
You also could get new characters and courses 
through the WonderGate as well. This feature also 
allowed you to see your score as part of a 
"global" ranking.
