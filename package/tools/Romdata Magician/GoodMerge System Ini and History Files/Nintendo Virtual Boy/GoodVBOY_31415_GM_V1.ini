Description=Alexey Pajitnov's classic puzzle game of falling blocks has a completely new perspective with 3D Tetris on Virtual Boy. The playing field is now in 3D, defined by wireframe graphics in the middle of the screen. Your goal is to manipulate a series of 3D blocks into a cube-shaped well to form solid layers. Clear ten layers to advance to the next level. Three play options include 3D Tetris, Center-Fill, and Puzzle. The latter involves creating specific shapes or patterns with the blocks to follow a picture displayed within the well. Battery-backed memory lets you save high scores for each game type.

Review=Review by Brett Alan Weiss<br><br>When GCE decided to include an Asteroids clone as a pack-in with their Vectrex system, it was a work of genius. The game not only exploits perfectly the system's vector graphics, it is a blast to play. As a matter of fact, some consider Mine Storm for the Vectrex to be even better than the arcade version of Asteroids. Quite a compliment, considering the fact that Asteroids is widely regarded as one of the best video games of all time. Myself, I've got a soft spot for Asteroids, but Mine Storm is an exciting and fun game in its own right.The enemy mines in this game are cleverly designed. Some of the bulkier mines are easy to destroy, but they crowd the screen. Many of the smaller mines hurl a fireball at you the second you shoot them. It's like they are sentient creatures, vowing revenge just as they meet their death.You should never be too close to a Fireball Mine when you shoot one, because the fireballs are difficult to avoid at close range. Luckily, if you get trapped by several mines, and you know you will surely meet death if you try to blast your way out, you can punch hyperspace, which will send you to another (randomly chosen) area of the screen.The controls for Mine Storm work wonderfully well. The mine-destroying blaster handles with precision and grace; it is extremely quick and can fire off volley after volley of shots with ease.Mine Storm looks fantastic. The ship and mines are sleekly designed, and the explosions are akin to a Fourth of July fireworks display.Mine Storm is a finely polished and professionally produced shooter. It's a great game for a great system. If you want to play Asteroids or an Asteroids clone for a home system, skip Asteroids for the Atari 2600 and find yourself a Vectrex.<br><br>Graphics (7)<br> Excellent use of the system's vector graphics. The game looks good even without the screen overlay.<br><br>Sound (5)<br> The game has a fitting but short musical intro. The sound effects are adequate, but the explosions and shots fired are staticy.<br><br>Enjoyment (8)<br> Mine Storm is an intense and challenging shooter.<br><br>Replay Value (8)<br> The game is hard without being frustrating.

Review=Review by Scott Alan Marriott<br><br>Even if you love pinball, you'll hate this game. Galactic Pinball is literally devoid of anything a pinball fan expects from a video game rendition. You want fast action? There's none to be found. You want a lot of targets to hit? The four pinball "tables" are nearly empty, aside from one main target, a few bumpers, and one or two ramps. You want realistic physics? How about substituting the ball with a hockey puck! Every time you use the flippers, the puck slowly moves up the surface as if it were struggling against a strong wind. The effect is like playing on an air hockey table -- but with a much heavier puck.It's a shame too: the game offers a great perspective of the tables with a convincing 3D effect. Each table is shown at a slight angle instead of the top-down view found in many console pinball games. The tables aren't traditional, either, since they float in the middle of space with tiny stars and small planets in the background. Adding to the galactic theme is one or two hovering objects (depending on the table), such as meteors that serve as a moving bumpers -- hit them and your puck will ricochet across the screen. Of course, the object of the game is like any other pinball title: score as many points as you can using your five pucks. The best feature of the game is that these scores will be saved to battery, which is something that should be found in all console pinball titles. Yet despite giving you some incentive to beat your last score, it still doesn't make the game more fun to play. The game needs more targets, more bonus rounds, more speech samples and more play modes. Galactic Pinball is a perfect example that having multiple tables isn't necessarily a great thing in a pinball game, especially if they're as empty as space.<br><br>Graphics (7)<br> The graphics look very nice, especially the 3D appearance of the tables.

Description=The Virtual Boy's first and only golf game features an 18-hole course at the fictitious Papillion Country Club. Choose either stroke or tournament play, with the latter pitting you against 47 computer players as you compete for the best total score. Before you hit the links, register your golfer's name so your stats can be saved to one of seven slots. The game will automatically save your best shots and track stats in the following eight categories:  longest drive, nearest to pin, average score, longest putt, number of victories, pars or better, longest chip, and fairways driven. Shots are initiated by navigating through a series of icons and reading the swing meter. Choose your club, adjust your stance, determine the power, and set the ball impact point, all while taking into account the direction and strength of the wind.<br><br>Features:<br> Choose one of two play options: stroke play or tournament<br> Compete against 47 computer-controlled golfers<br> Avoid water hazards, bunkers, and trees while making your shots

Review=Review by Scott Alan Marriott<br><br>Is it me or does the Virtual Boy have a lot of sports titles? That's a good thing for any new system; sports games are one of the most popular genres on the market. It also makes sense to use the 3D capabilities of the system to immerse fans into the game. Golf for the Virtual Boy doesn't skimp out on the features, either. You can create seven golfers, store individual or course records, and even save your best shots to battery. If you're familiar with T & E Soft's line of golf games, then you'll feel right at home with this one. The game uses a five-step system to set up your shot with icons to walk you through the process. The first step is to determine the direction of your shot. Keeping an eye on the wind direction and speed, you must position a cursor to the left or right of the screen. An overhead hole diagram will help you determine the right approach. The second step involves choosing from 14 possible clubs based on your distance to the pin. Next, select the stance icon to adjust your foot position and then determine the amount of draw or fade on the ball by moving your feet left or right. After fiddling with your stance, you're ready to begin the swing. A 3D arc meter will appear in the center of the screen with a line at the top signifying 100% power. Press a button and a little ball will move up the arc until it reaches the top; press the button again to determine the amount of power. Once the power is selected, a large golf ball will appear on the screen with a dot that zig-zags its way across the surface. As the dot reaches the desired point of impact, hit a button and a golfer will carry out the shot. Golf doesn't provide a very convincing sense of 3D. The problem is that the camera system doesn't follow the ball as it sails into the air, which would have given the game a believable sense of depth. Another issue is that a golf game doesn't look very attractive when you're looking at red grass and trees. While there is some excellent shading to give the game a realistic look, you certainly won't mistake this course for the real deal. I'm also a little wary about sticking my face in the system for such a long period of time -- this game isn't exactly a fast round of golf.The process could have been streamlined if the golfer was visible on the screen at all times: going through each menu takes too long and removes you from the action. Still, I'm very impressed with the attention to detail and depth of features for a Virtual Boy game. If you love golf and own a Virtual Boy, it doesn't get much better than this. An added benefit is that Mario and his buddies are nowhere to be found. Come to think of it, that might not have been such a bad thing...<br><br>Graphics (6)<br> Nice use of shading to overcome the limitations of the system.

Description=Take the gameplay of the classic Mario Bros., imagine a 3D twist and you'll probably end up with Nintendo's Mario Clash for the Virtual Boy. The Clash House tower is filled with little critters walking through pipes and along narrow ledges, so it's up to Mario to knock them off using Koopa (or turtle) shells.The twist is that the critters are moving in both the foreground and background, giving each level a 3D appearance. Defeat all of the enemies on a level and you'll move to the next, eventually making your way through 40 floors to the top of the tower. Of course, gameplay will become faster and you'll encounter more challenging enemies the higher you climb. No one said being a plumber was easy!

Review=Review by Scott Alan Marriott<br><br>Imagine Mario Bros. with a 3D perspective and you'll end up with Mario Clash for the Virtual Boy. As in the arcade classic, gameplay involves bouncing on small turtles (Koopas) and picking up their shells to throw at various enemies within a fixed, non-scrolling level. Two turtles will crawl out of pipes on either side of the screen along with enemies, the number of which depends on the level or floor of the tower. As you stomp and throw a turtle shell, another Koopa will emerge to replace the one lost. One set of pipes will take you up or down and another will take you deep into the background, adding a depth of play the original Mario Bros. never had. Mario Clash uses the new perspective to another advantage: you can throw turtle shells into or out of the background to knock enemies off ledges! Think of it as a shooting gallery only with shells as the ammo. In fact, most enemies can only be defeated in this manner.Mario Clash is a game that relies on split-second timing and jumping with precision. The problem with this is that the control is a little slippery: Mario isn't as heavy as he should be and jumping isn't as precise as it could be. When swirling fireballs and ghosts start flying around the screen, Mario's floating jumps can get frustrating.Another issue is that you can select from any of the game's forty levels right off the bat. This is both good and bad. Bad because people may skip to level forty, win the game and feel cheated; good because people who want to jump right in on the action won't have to waste time on the easier levels. Since it is an arcade game in which players compete for score, many won't mind this option at all. After all, you're not going to score as many points if you start on a higher level, and you'll also miss out on the bonus rounds.They will mind, however, that high scores are not saved after the game's turned off! This is regrettable since the game rewards skillful players with bonus points for defeating multiple enemies with one shot or within a certain time. Mario Clash is a fun game that ultimately suffers from its relatively simple, repetitive style of play, hurting its long term value. It's simply hard to come back to a game knowing that your best efforts will be erased as soon as you flick the switch.<br><br>Graphics (6)<br> All of the characters look like the ones from the Super Mario series.

Description=Mario's Tennis places you on a three-dimensional tennis court against one of seven characters from Mario's past games: Mario, Luigi, Princess Toadstool, Yoshi, Toad, Koopa or Donkey Kong Jr. All have individual ratings in speed, power and racquet contact area, so find a character that best suits your playing style and select a game of singles or doubles play. Don't worry, you won't have to control both characters; the computer will take over as your partner. Players can also select the difficulty level, length of match, or enter a tournament to play a series of singles or doubles matches until victorious. Tennis features such as hitting ground strokes, lobs, volleys and smashes are all incorporated in the game as are the official rules. Players can also check their statistics after each match, such as total aces served, double faults, errors, net points, baseline points and first serve percentage. Lakitu will be your Chair Umpire and keeps score for all of the matches, but don't think about arguing over line calls -- it's not allowed!

Review=Review by Scott Alan Marriott<br><br>Mario's Tennis is notable for being the first (and only) pack-in game for the U.S. Virtual Boy, and soon after powering up the gizmo, you'll see why. It's incredibly fun! There is a convincing amount of depth on the court which really immerses you into the game, and the inclusion of Nintendo's finest as your opponents helps keep things lively. While it isn't the deepest tennis game you'll play, I'd wager it's one of the most addictive, with the right blend of action and strategy to satisfy anyone looking for an arcade take on the sport. Before hitting the court, you'll first choose between playing a singles match, doubles match or entering a Tournament. (Single-player tournaments allow you to face three opponents, while doubles only two). Select between easy, normal and hard difficulty, the match length (one or three sets) as well as your character, teammate and opponent(s).Your character always appears in the foreground with the camera fixed behind and slightly above him, her, or in the case of Toad, it. The net is kept low, with one row of "hearts" separating your character from your opponent, making it very easy to see into the distance. Hitting the ball relies on the proper positioning and timing of your swing. If you hit the button while the ball is in the air, you'll perform an overhead smash; if you push left or right while swinging, the ball will move left or right on the court.Lobs are performed in the same manner but using a different button. The earlier you swing while pressing the directional pad, the more sharply a ball will travel. Serving simply involves pressing a button to toss the ball into the air and pressing it again to make contact. After serving, if you run toward the net you'll automatically volley once you get within a certain distance.To get the most out of this game, you'll want to play all of your matches on the "hard" difficulty level. This increases the game's overall speed and takes into account the various differences in characters. Each player has varying quickness, power, racquet sizes, as well as court strengths such as net, baseline and ground stroke ability. Yoshi, for example, is the fastest of the bunch, but he has small racquet contact area so you'll need to be more precise with your positioning to return volleys. A tennis game wouldn't be complete without a few faults (snicker, snicker), and this one is no different. Minor quibbles include the lack of league play, saved statistics, and multiple court surfaces such as grass or clay to compete on. It also would have been nice to play as or against more characters, with at least 14 to choose from instead of only seven. Apparently both Wario and Bowser had prior commitments... Yet Mario's Tennis remains an extremely entertaining arcade experience, one where it's easy to pick up but difficult to put down.<br><br>Graphics (5)<br> The clean graphics show detailed facial expressions for each character whenever they win or lose points. There is only one court, but there are different backdrops depending on the character you're facing (Princess Toadstool has a castle in the scenery, for example).<br><br>Sound (3)<br> Everytime you make contact with the ball you'll hear a "plink."<br><br>Enjoyment (8)<br> The game really does give you a feeling that you are there.

Review=Review by Scott Alan Marriott<br><br>Nester's Funky Bowling may not be the funkiest game of bowling out there, but as a Virtual Boy title, it certainly offers a lot of fun. Bowling fans shouldn't expect realistic physics or details such as lane conditions, different balls or individual skill ratings. It's a game designed to appeal to gamers of all ages and is reminiscent of those "bowling" games found at amusement parks. Just aim the ball and try to knock the pins down -- nothing too complicated.The game begins by choosing former Nintendo Power magazine star Nester or his twin sister Hester to bowl a Single Game, Practice or Challenge. Practice lets you set up the pins yourself and Challenge has you trying to make certain skill shots. After you choose the game mode, you can enter a four-letter name, choose your bowler's handedness and even the weight of the ball (from 8 to 16 pounds).Bowling involves positioning either Nester or Hester to the left or right of the lane, selecting spin by pressing a button while a horizontal meter moves back and forth, and then determining the strength of your shot by using a vertical power meter. Despite the simple interface, it's not easy to consistently strike, so you don't have to worry about bowling a perfect game every time you play. The pin physics are rather suspect at times, however. The problem is that the pins are flat instead of being in 3D, but you can pick tough spares if you aim your shot correctly.Adding to the action are funny little cinema screens appearing after every shot. You'll see things like a pin sticking out its tongue when you split or a large turkey whenever you throw three strikes in a row. Both Nester and Hester cheer if they get a strike or become angry if they miss (complete with steam coming out of their ears).While the animation is a cute addition, the missing features take away from some of the replay value. There needs to be a battery to save your scores, a tournament with multiple bowlers and a create-bowler feature with different abilities. Yet Nester's Funky Bowling offers a good time to software-starved Virtual Boy owners and comes highly recommended to anyone looking for a nice change of pace.<br><br>Graphics (7)<br> The lane is shown with a good sense of depth and the characters are very detailed.

According to legend, you must first acquire three celestial medals of power in order to unlock the gates securing the statue. Needless to say, these medals are well guarded by some strange characters! In Panic-Bomber, you must defeat these villains who stand in the way of your quest. To do this, you will have to beat them at their own puzzle game -- one in which you must line up falling blocks next to those with similar patterns. Match any three together and they disappear from the screen. A Bomberman game wouldn't be complete without a variety of bombs to wreak havoc with, so count on some explosive and frantic action. Bombs away!
SimilarGames=Columns
Review=Review by Scott Alan Marriott<br><br>While Panic Bomber doesn't use the Virtual Boy's depth for any new play mechanics (like 3D Tetris), the game is still very fun to play. Originally designed for the Super Famicom, Panic Bomber features similar type of action as found in Puyo Puyo, Kirby's Avalanche, Columns or Dr. Robotnik's Mean Bean Machine. You are trying to eliminate similarly shaped objects from the playing field by dropping blocks grouped in three. These objects (there are five different sets to choose from) can be rotated or moved from side to side as you search for a match either horizontally, vertically or diagonally.From time to time, a lit bomb will also fall from the top of the screen; position it near inactive bombs and you'll cause a chain reaction of explosions. The remains will then appear on your opponent's screen as "scorched bombs" that can only be removed with an active bomb's blast. As you eliminate the various objects from the playing field, a vertical Decker meter will gradually rise; once it's maxed, a special Decker Bomb will fall from the top of the screen destroying anything it touches! Since the object of Panic Bomber is to defeat computer opponents (you face two local characters and a boss for each of the four areas on the island), you have two choices of battle: Skull Mode and Normal. Skull Mode replaces any scorched bombs with bricks, which hold special power-ups once they are blown apart by a live bomb. While these items can have various outcomes, most are designed to harm the opponent: a floating Bomberman that interferes with the playing field; speed blocks; reverse controls; all bricks turning into unlit bombs; a stop sign that freezes the action for five seconds; and an icon that eliminates all of the blocks on the playing field.There are many more items that make each game feel different and unpredictable in this mode, which really adds to the excitement. Even if you think you've got the computer beat, a Skull Item could quickly reverse the momentum and really cause a panic! The only downside is there's no option to play a solo game without computer opponents or puzzle mode that could have offered various situations to work out of. Panic Bomber just screams for two-player support as well, although the system really isn't designed for such action (no link cable). While it would have been nice if there were more features, Panic Bomber is an enjoyable puzzle game that no Virtual Boy owner should be without.<br><br>Graphics (7)<br> The graphics can give you a headache if you choose certain pieces to play with.

Review=Review by Scott Alan Marriott<br><br>Red Alarm is an intense 3D shooter that almost overwhelms you with so much going on at once. While for most games in the genre this is positive, for Red Alarm it becomes rather disorienting. If you are looking for a Virtual Boy game to make you bump into the furniture immediately after playing, this is it. The problem stems from the way the graphics are presented. All objects are detailed wire-frames, meaning the game is drawn using only straight lines, similar to the arcade classic Battlezone. This makes structures hard to see because there is empty space between the lines defining them. Add multiple enemy fighters and ground defenses into the mix, and it can be very difficult to navigate your ship, especially when you are trying to fight back! You will have to concentrate very hard to take in all the game throws at you if you plan on making it through unscathed.Still, the game does deliver a true sense of depth like you've never experienced from a home console until now. You can fly into the background by speeding up -- or stop on a dime and fly in reverse -- with a simple button press. There are also multiple camera angles that can help you navigate, but the default view (behind the ship) is the most effective.The cockpit mode would have been perfect if not for one glaring fault: you can't tell the outline of your ship, making it easy to crash into obstacles you think you've cleared. In addition, the game is filled with surrounding walls that make it difficult to negotiate in this mode -- if you were flying in open space it would be much more practical.It's really hard to fault the developers of this game, as they have created a very detailed setting for which to fight in. Walls have faces stretching out of them like a scene from The Abyss, there are several interesting bosses to combat, and you'll even hear some speech. Deep down there is a fine shooter that is simply hard to enjoy due to the limitations of the hardware...and that is truly a shame.<br><br>Graphics (5)<br> Very detailed wire-frame graphics are interesting to look at, but very difficult to distinguish from one another in this intense shooter.<br><br>Sound (6)<br> Some speech and good music add a lot to the game.<br><br>Enjoyment (4)<br> The enjoyment factor is directly related to how well you can make out the various enemies and structures while flying.<br><br>Replay Value (4)<br> Shooters don't typically have high replay values and this one is no different.<br><br>Documentation (8)<br> Nice full-color manual that explains nearly everything you need to know.

Description=It is the 22nd century and boxing, as we know it, no longer exists. Technology has advanced to the point where remote controlled robots have replaced human fighters in countries all over the world. These Teleroboxers, as they are called, have recently organized to compete in a tournament to end all tournaments. Which fighter is skilled enough to be called the world champion? Nintendo's Teleroboxer lets you step into the ring controlling your alter-ego Harry the Robot as you vie for the championship. Use jabs, uppercuts, body blows, or the special "machine-gun attack" to knock out your foes. Defend yourself from punches by guarding, dodging or ducking to avoid damage to your strength meter. Each fight lasts up to five rounds, and after each bout your progress is automatically saved along with your overall record. Should you defeat all eight opponents in the tournament, you will become champion, but wait -- it's not over! You still have to face random opponents who will try to take it all away from you. If you lose, your champion will be permanently retired and you'll start once again at the bottom.

Review=Review by Scott Alan Marriott<br><br>Of the games that could benefit most from the Virtual Boy's capabilities, boxing fans were undoubtedly excited about the possibility of a 3D Punch-Out. Imagine their surprise as one of the announced launch titles was Teleroboxer, a futuristic boxing game in the same vein as the Nintendo classic. Okay, so it's with robots instead of over-the-top human characters, fans will be able to live with that. The mere notion of a first-person boxing game with a true sense of depth was a step in the right direction.The icing on the cake was that the game would save your won-loss records, and after you became champion, you'd fight random opponents until you lost your crown. Imagine watching your champ go 32-0 before finally losing to some young robotic upstart -- it's hard not to get excited about the possibilities.Rarely has a title showing this much promise been so disappointing. Teleroboxer is an absolute chore to control, from small delays after hitting button presses to extremely awkward moves designed for the Virtual Boy's unique controller. Since the action is coming at you so fast, it is crucial that you can be at "one" with the controls to react quickly. Even after staring at the list of commands for a seeming eternity, players still won't be able to get the robot to do what they want. To make matters worse, the computer is as fast as lightning -- making the sluggish controls even more painfully apparent. As you may or may not know, the Virtual Boy has two directional pads on both sides of the controller as well as two buttons on the back. To jab, uppercut or block, you have to press each pad along with the buttons to account for the left and right "hands" of the boxer. Yes, it sounds good on paper, but it is horribly implemented. Trying to string together a combination is a lesson in futility; counter-punching is counter-intuitive. After going 3-18 in your first 21 games, you'll come to hate that record saving feature that was such an interesting feature. Those who dream of becoming champion should realize it's just that -- a dream. And the game? An absolute nightmare.<br><br>Graphics (6)<br> The graphics are the best part of the game. While some of the robots look goofy (one looks like a cat, another looks like the Tin Man from The Wizard of Oz), they are very detailed. The flying fists give you a good sense of 3D, although the rest of the game's depth is unimpressive. A great effect is when you're knocked out and the screen is smashed by the computer. (Don't worry, you'll see this a lot!)<br><br>Sound (5)<br> Sound is also another bright spot with crowd cheers after you knock the computer out, but the punches don't sound like you're hitting machinery.<br><br>Enjoyment (1)<br> Poor control and cheap computer opponents absolutely destroy the fun factor. This game made me want to box with the developers for making it so difficult!<br><br>Replay Value (2)<br> It has the right features for excellent replay value except for one thing: fun!<br><br>Documentation (7)<br> It's just too bad all of the robots aren't described with their pictures, because I have a funny feeling many gamers won't see half of them...

Description=The classic game of Tetris has been translated to the Virtual Boy with 3D visual effects and a completely new play mode. Besides the original game, where you manipulate seven types of falling pieces to form horizontal lines, there is a new variation called Loop Tetris. Loop Tetris has you scrolling the playing field to the left or right instead of staring at a single screen. Since the entire well is like a cylinder, you'll need to constantly revolve the playing field so that one area doesn't get too high. V-Tetris also offers a variation on the original game in which you have to eliminate a certain number of rows before continuing on to the next level.The Virtual Boy shows both the well and pieces in the foreground while various images are positioned in the background, creating the illusion of depth. The Loop Tetris game even offers moving backgrounds such as falling snowflakes or leaves! The game also lets you enter your initials for each of the three game modes, but high scores are not saved once you turn off the console. While V-Tetris was released exclusively in Japan, all of the screen commands are in English, so gamers can still play without reading the instructions. Players can choose between three types of music tracks in addition to the starting level (from one to nine) and round (one to five).

In this 3D side-scrolling adventure, play as Wario gathering hearts, coins and mysterious artifacts -- all while defeating various baddies trying to stop you. In order to progress to the next level, you must first locate a key and then board an elevator moving you one step closer to the finish. Travel in between the foreground and background, underwater and through woods to locate the one hidden treasure piece on each stage. During the journey you'll face several boss characters, so it's a good idea to practice your moves. Along with the standard running and jumping, Wario will be able to swim, body slam, toss, stomp and barge into enemies. There are also four power-ups somewhere in the caverns, transforming you into Bull Wario, King Dragon Wario, Sea Dragon Wario and Eagle Wario. If that isn't enough, play several mini-games to get more lives, time or coins as you make your way up from the underground. Don't forget to save your progress and treasure totals in between levels... Happy hunting!

Review=Review by Scott Alan Marriott<br><br>Virtual Boy Wario Land really shows off the system's potential with its multi-layered graphics and convincing sense of 3D. The game is much more than a technical showcase, however. It is not only the best action-platformer on the system (in fact, it's the only one!), but it compares favorably with best of the Mario series.Only one thing keeps it from being an equal: the length of the game, which isn't as long as you'd expect from a Nintendo platformer. Still, this is a beautiful title that's extremely fun to play, with diverse moves, excellent control and challenging boss characters. The goal of collecting every piece of treasure will keep you glued to your red screen until you achieve the best possible ending.Fans of Wario Land for the Game Boy will recognize the style of graphics and play mechanics instantly. Wario is the antithesis of Mario, with a look that would make the Italian plumber squirm. His mustache is jagged and pointy; his eyebrows slope down giving him a menacing stare; and his teeth are always clenched in a wicked smile. In other words, he's fun to play! Wario has several moves up his yellow sleeve that'll help him defeat various nasties lurking within the underground levels.Along with the standard run, jump, swim and duck, Wario can lower his head and slam his shoulder into enemies; stun them by stomping on their heads; lift their stunned bodies and toss them into other creatures; or he can forgo the stunning and go right for the body slam, which will flatten most creatures right to the ground. Wario can also wear special hats giving him added abilities, such as flying or shooting fire.It's a good thing you have such a variety of moves. Enemies include bats carrying bombs, fish with chainsaw noses, spiked-hat throwing tortoises, watermelon-dropping bees and many more. Levels will also have their own sets of obstacles such as spikes, bubbling lava pools, swinging pendulums and bottomless pits. These dangers require you to move carefully instead of rushing right through the stages.The game probably sounds like a traditional 2D platform game, but you can move far into the background to continue your search for treasure, coins, hearts or keys. Every time you collect 100 hearts you gain a life; keys are needed to open locked doors; and coins are part of your high score. There is also one hidden artifact on each level (not including the boss stages). While the basic goal is to find the elevator and exit the area, to get the most out of this game you'll want to search and collect everything. A battery will keep track of your collected treasures, so you don't have to worry about starting from scratch every time you play. And play you will! The game lets you show off your platforming skills by offering enemies and huge bosses on two different planes -- all while you're searching for that missing piece of treasure. Wario may not get all the attention he deserves, but his game is every bit as fun as one of his brother's. Highly recommended!<br><br>Graphics (8)<br> Character graphics are extremely detailed and the environments really deliver a feeling of depth. Flying enemies will move from the background to the foreground with a believable sense of 3D.<br><br>Sound (5)<br> Sound is reminiscent of the original Super Mario Bros. for the NES. It's nothing spectacular, but it fits the game well.<br><br>Enjoyment (8)<br> If the Virtual Boy had more games like this when it was released, perhaps it would have enjoyed a longer life span. It's too bad that a company known for platform games couldn't have come up with a few more before the system's demise. The bottom line is that Virtual Boy Wario Land is extremely enjoyable and a worthy addition to your library.<br><br>Replay Value (7)<br> The levels are not that long, so you really need to search for the treasure to maximize the replay value. While the cartridge saves your progress, it also makes the game easier to finish, although you'll open up a more challenging difficulty level if you finish with all of the artifacts.<br><br>Documentation (8)<br> The manual is in full color and explains everything except for the treasure artifacts.

Description=The first (and only) American baseball release for the Virtual Boy brings together 18 teams from around the world to compete in one 3D ballpark. Kemco's Virtual League Baseball uses the Virtual Boy's unique perspective to make it seem like every pitch is coming at you. The game offers three different modes of play, including a Single Game, All-Star Game and Pennant Race.The pitching and batting interface is strictly arcade-style, meaning you steer each pitch and time your swing as the ball approaches the plate. While substitutions are allowed for both batters and pitchers, the game does not save any lineup changes or statistics. Virtual League Baseball is also missing both Major League Baseball and MLBPA licenses that would have allowed for real players and team names.

Review=Review by Scott Alan Marriott<br><br>Okay, here's the deal: a company (Kemco) is trying to convince American baseball fans (the target audience) that their game (Virtual League Baseball) is something worth owning, so they decide to advertise in various gaming magazines. Nothing wrong with that, right? Nope. Yet Kemco decided that tasteless humor was the best way to win fans over, so they used a two-page ad featuring the backsides of two portly men with their pants hanging dangerously low.The slogan? "Finally, baseball without the chili dog farts." You know something, I was waiting for a game that would finally capture the nuances of the sport without including those bothersome chili dog farts! The funny thing is, I'd rather sit directly behind those two fellows through a double-header than play this game past an inning. I guess there's no truth in advertising: Virtual League Baseball stinks.The differences between this game and the Japanese Virtual Professional Baseball 95 are merely cosmetic. Instead of the short, cartoon-like players and real Japanese teams, we have taller, more human looking players and fictional "international" teams. Yet despite the difference in visuals, the game plays exactly the same. This is not a good thing. Do you want a season mode? How about multiple ballparks and camera angles? Real players, trades and tracked statistics? Sorry, none of these elements are found in this game.Now perhaps the lack of standard baseball features would be okay if the title offered exciting gameplay, but Virtual League Baseball is reminiscent of Major League Baseball for the Nintendo Entertainment System. If you're not familiar with the game, here's a recap: plinky sound effects, only one stadium, all fielders moving in unison with the control pad (including the infield and outfield!), a batting and pitching interface that relies on one button, and base runners who move at the speed of light. Are these features you want in a 1995 release? Certainly not, especially on a system that's supposed to deliver a "virtual" experience. Avoid this game and pray that some other company delivers a suitable alternative.<br><br>Graphics (4)<br> The batters look much better than those found in Virtual Professional Baseball '95, but the high overhead fielding view means you'll have to squint to see them after making contact.<br><br>Sound (2)<br> Plink, plink, plink.<br><br>Enjoyment (2)<br> This game would have been acceptable had it been released ten years earlier.<br><br>Replay Value (1)<br> Even if it's the only Virtual Boy title you own, you'll have more fun looking at the box cover.<br><br>Documentation (6)<br> This is the one bright spot in an otherwise lackluster release.

Description=Kemco's Virtual Professional Baseball 95 offers eighteen professional Japanese baseball teams along with actual player statistics based on the 1994 season. Other than the differences in teams (there are no pro teams in the U.S. version), the game is essentially the same game as Virtual League Baseball with one other notable exception: the players resemble chipmunks! While the game features only one stadium, if you are looking to play as the Yakult Swallows, Yokohama BayStars or Seibu Lions, and don't mind non-human players, this could be your field of dreams.

Review=Review by Scott Alan Marriott<br><br>I don't understand this game, and it's not because it's in Japanese. What boggles my mind is how any developer could release such a simplistic game in 1995. Not only does this game completely ignore what the Virtual Boy has to offer, but the gameplay is almost exactly like the early baseball titles for the NES. Let's step back ten years to 1985, where we have small little characters, plinky sound effects, one generic stadium, a single batting view, fielders all moving in unison with the control pad (yes both infield and outfield!), a batting and pitching interface consisting of one button, and base runners scurrying at the speed of light.Yes, Kemco has included all of these "features" into their game. In fact, the only noteworthy aspect is that you determine the amount of speed on your pitch by holding down the button. I hope you were sitting down for that one... Baseball games have evolved over the years, but it's hard to tell looking at this title. I was shocked when I first played the game.The most aggravating thing is that baseball seems like a natural fit considering the Virtual Boy's 3D abilities. Imagine the batter's box view from a game like World Series Baseball, but with the ball zooming toward you at high speeds. Better yet, a fielder's view where you see the ball the moment it leaves the bat.These are the obvious uses of 3D, but what we are given is a view far behind the batter and a distant view of the stadium. Fielders are roughly the size of ants and run faster to the infield than they throw. I was surprised to see that you could make substitutions, so I guess the game isn't completely worthless. While the game features the Japanese pro teams, don't expect a huge difference in player abilities. The statistics are the only way to tell if a player is "good," but the simplistic arcade action means that everyone can hit home runs or steal bases, and the only difference between pitchers seems to be the velocity.From start to finish, this is a tremendous disappointment. Unless you feel that baseball games peaked during the first years of the NES, you should avoid this game at all costs. The Virtual Boy is capable of much more.<br><br>Graphics (2)<br> Little baseball players are supposed to be "cute." The best thing about the players is that they're not super-deformed with enormous heads.

Review=Review by Scott Alan Marriott<br><br>Waterworld was a strange movie. Regardless of what you actually thought of it, the press seemed to label the film as a colossal failure even before it was released. Plagued by well-publicized shooting delays due to unpredictable weather and several script changes, the 1995 movie debuted in late August -- on the tail end of the summer season. Not the perfect time to release an action movie, eh?Yet despite all of these issues (and an estimated $176 million price tag), the movie still made a profit. Why mention all of this? While the movie may not have been as dismal a failure as many would believe (at least commercially), the video game is. Waterworld for the Virtual Boy should have been sealed in cement and tossed overboard rather than being released in its present state.The biggest problem? That's hard to pin down, but the feeling that this game isn't finished is probably the most irritating aspect. Waterworld is structured like a bonus game -- something that should provide a diversion in between the main storyline.The view is set behind the Mariner's ship as you try to save ten stranded Atollers (and the little girl Enola) from the clutches of the Smokers, who ride around on jet skis, and Seekers, who travel by boat. To do this, you'll need to shoot them down before they can carry the Atollers away to sea. Sound interesting? Good, because that's the entire game.The levels repeat one after another until you eventually fail to save all of the Atollers or become sick of the repetitive nature of gameplay. Don't expect the 3D visuals to draw you in, because you'll be hard-pressed to tell you're playing something that could only be done on the Virtual Boy. The skyline is devoid of anything to make it seem like you're in a new world and the water is completely black.Levels all look the same with the exception of a few additional dangers to make it more difficult (a shark will appear after a few levels, for example). There are no additional objectives or missions to complete, zero power-ups or ship upgrades, you can't fight boss characters, it never feels like you're traveling over water, and the 3D effect is non-existent. It is precisely titles like this that make gamers shudder whenever they hear the words "movie-licensed game."<br><br>Graphics (3)<br> The graphics show very little sense of depth and the levels all look the same.<br><br>Sound (4)<br> The sound effects and music are not bad, but they do get repetitive after awhile.<br><br>Enjoyment (1)<br> The "game" should have been a bonus round!

Review=Review by Scott Alan Marriott<br><br>Is it me or does the Virtual Boy have a lot of sports titles? That's a good thing for any new system; sports games are one of the most popular genres on the market. It also makes sense to use the 3D capabilities of the system to immerse fans into the game. Golf for the Virtual Boy doesn't skimp out on the features, either. You can create seven golfers, store individual or course records, and even save your best shots to battery. If you're familiar with T & E Soft's line of golf games, then you'll feel right at home with this one. The game uses a five-step system to set up your shot with icons to walk you through the process. The first step is to determine the direction of your shot. Keeping an eye on the wind direction and speed, you must position a cursor to the left or right of the screen. An overhead hole diagram will help you determine the right approach. The second step involves choosing from 14 possible clubs based on your distance to the pin. Next, select the stance icon to adjust your foot position and then determine the amount of draw or fade on the ball by moving your feet left or right. After fiddling with your stance, you're ready to begin the swing. A 3D arc meter will appear in the center of the screen with a line at the top signifying 100% power. Press a button and a little ball will move up the arc until it reaches the top; press the button again to determine the amount of power. Once the power is selected, a large golf ball will appear on the screen with a dot that zig-zags its way across the surface. As the dot reaches the desired point of impact, hit a button and a golfer will carry out the shot. Golf doesn't provide a very convincing sense of 3D. The problem is that the camera system doesn't follow the ball as it sails into the air, which would have given the game a believable sense of depth. Another issue is that a golf game doesn't look very attractive when you're looking at red grass and trees. While there is some excellent shading to give the game a realistic look, you certainly won't mistake this course for the real deal. I'm also a little wary about sticking my face in the system for such a long period of time -- this game isn't exactly a fast round of golf.The process could have been streamlined if the golfer was visible on the screen at all times: going through each menu takes too long and removes you from the action. Still, I'm very impressed with the attention to detail and depth of features for a Virtual Boy game. If you love golf and own a Virtual Boy, it doesn't get much better than this. An added benefit is that Mario and his buddies are nowhere to be found. Come to think of it, that might not have been such a bad thing...<br><br>Graphics (6)<br> Nice use of shading to overcome the limitations of the system.

Description=Join Hudson Soft's famous hero as you search the mysterious island of Ever-Mist for the lost Golden Statue of Bomberman. According to legend, you must first acquire three celestial medals of power in order to unlock the gates securing the statue. Needless to say, these medals are well guarded by some strange characters! In Panic-Bomber, you must defeat these villains who stand in the way of your quest. To do this, you will have to beat them at their own puzzle game -- one in which you must line up falling blocks next to those with similar patterns. Match any three together and they disappear from the screen. A Bomberman game wouldn't be complete without a variety of bombs to wreak havoc with, so count on some explosive and frantic action. Bombs away!

Description=The first (and only) American baseball release for the Virtual Boy brings together 18 teams from around the world to compete in one 3D ballpark. Kemco's Virtual League Baseball uses the Virtual Boy's unique perspective to make it seem like every pitch is coming at you. The game offers three different modes of play, including a Single Game, All-Star Game and Pennant Race.The pitching and batting interface is strictly arcade-style, meaning you steer each pitch and time your swing as the ball approaches the plate. While substitutions are allowed for both batters and pitchers, the game does not save any lineup changes or statistics. Virtual League Baseball is also missing both Major League Baseball and MLBPA licenses that would have allowed for real players and team names.

Review=Review by Scott Alan Marriott<br><br>Okay, here's the deal: a company (Kemco) is trying to convince American baseball fans (the target audience) that their game (Virtual League Baseball) is something worth owning, so they decide to advertise in various gaming magazines. Nothing wrong with that, right? Nope. Yet Kemco decided that tasteless humor was the best way to win fans over, so they used a two-page ad featuring the backsides of two portly men with their pants hanging dangerously low.The slogan? "Finally, baseball without the chili dog farts." You know something, I was waiting for a game that would finally capture the nuances of the sport without including those bothersome chili dog farts! The funny thing is, I'd rather sit directly behind those two fellows through a double-header than play this game past an inning. I guess there's no truth in advertising: Virtual League Baseball stinks.The differences between this game and the Japanese Virtual Professional Baseball 95 are merely cosmetic. Instead of the short, cartoon-like players and real Japanese teams, we have taller, more human looking players and fictional "international" teams. Yet despite the difference in visuals, the game plays exactly the same. This is not a good thing. Do you want a season mode? How about multiple ballparks and camera angles? Real players, trades and tracked statistics? Sorry, none of these elements are found in this game.Now perhaps the lack of standard baseball features would be okay if the title offered exciting gameplay, but Virtual League Baseball is reminiscent of Major League Baseball for the Nintendo Entertainment System. If you're not familiar with the game, here's a recap: plinky sound effects, only one stadium, all fielders moving in unison with the control pad (including the infield and outfield!), a batting and pitching interface that relies on one button, and base runners who move at the speed of light. Are these features you want in a 1995 release? Certainly not, especially on a system that's supposed to deliver a "virtual" experience. Avoid this game and pray that some other company delivers a suitable alternative.<br><br>Graphics (4)<br> The batters look much better than those found in Virtual Professional Baseball '95, but the high overhead fielding view means you'll have to squint to see them after making contact.<br><br>Sound (2)<br> Plink, plink, plink.<br><br>Enjoyment (2)<br> This game would have been acceptable had it been released ten years earlier.<br><br>Replay Value (1)<br> Even if it's the only Virtual Boy title you own, you'll have more fun looking at the box cover.<br><br>Documentation (6)<br> This is the one bright spot in an otherwise lackluster release. Everything is explained clearly.
