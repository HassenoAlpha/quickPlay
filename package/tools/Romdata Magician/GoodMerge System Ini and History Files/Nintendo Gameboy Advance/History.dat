You take on the role of James Bond and must save 
the world.  The Phoenix International Corporation

throughout the world, but lately evidence has been 
found that the CEO of the corporation, Raphael

to find and use the warheads for his own purposes. 
 Because his plans are so well hidden, it is up to 
Bond, with the help of Q and his gadgets, to stop 
Drake at whatever cost. 
 
Throughout the game, you will be taken to more 
than ten exotic areas, reaching all areas of the 
globe, confronting the beautiful Bond women.  In 
your quest to stop the Phoenix Corporation, you 
have have a variety of weapons available to you, 
from your trusty Walther to more advanced and 
prototype machinery. 
 
There are twelve total missions, all of which 
combine stealth, combat, and Q's trusty gadgets, 
such as your laser watch and X-ray eye glasses.' 
 
There are five levels which take place in your 
Aston Martin V12 Vanquish, and other exotic but 
deadly sports cars. These missions aren't 
available in the computer version of the game, 
instead the Windows version has some other bonus 
missions. 
 
On the multiplayer side of things, there are over 
ten multiplayer modes, some of which include 
characters and settings from previous Bond moves.

to shoot a number of enemies within a certain 
time. The other is a strength test where Ace must

In the South Pacific, Master Higgins lives 
peacefully wearing only a grass skirt and a cap. 
That is until the Evil Witch Doctor decides to 
capture the Princess Leilani and hold her as his 
own. It's up to Master Higgins to gather throwing 
axes, fireballs and skateboards in order to aid 
his noble quest. 
 
The game is a side scroller, Master Higgins moves 
across the screen from left to right and finds his 
power-ups in giant eggs. This includes a 
skateboard which results in a great speed 
enhancement - until Master Higgins gets hit and 
loses his power. If he is not on a skateboard a 
hit means instant death. Another game mechanic is 
starvation which gets indicated through a meter 
which steadily decreases. If it hits zero the hero 
dies and the only way to fill it up is by 
collecting food on the way. Bosses await him at 
the end of levels, all the way to the Evil Witch 
Doctor himself.

With the construction of Jimmy Neutron's latest 
invention, he accidentally teleports himself into 
an alternate dimension, switching places with the 
evil Jimmy Negatron, who is now causing mayhem in

Jimmy Negatron, you control Jimmy Neutron as he 
battles his evil alter ego, Jimmy Negatron, to try 
and put Retroville back to normal.  The game is 
presented in a 3rd Person perspective using Mode 7

graphics to give the illusion that the player is 
in a fully 3D world.  As Jimmy travels through 
eleven different dimensions, he uses many 
different gadgets including the shrink ray, the 
robot disassembling ray, the dimension jump ray, 
the rocket ship and, of course, his robot dog, 
Goddard. 
 
The game also features two different multiplayer 
games: War of Electrons and Collecting Coins, both 
which can be played with up to two players.

Aggressive Inline (c) Aug 27, 2002 Full Fat 
Productions Ltd. / Acclaim Entertainment, Inc. 
 
In Aggressive Inline the player takes the role of 
one of nine real-life skaters with one specific 
goal: receiving as much points as possible by 
performing spectacular stunts. Every of the 13 
courses also has various special challenges, e.g. 
collecting or smashing certain items, which need 
to be performed to beat it. In contrast to the 
open areas of the console versions this one 
features more linear levels and tight time limits. 
 
It also replaces the "juice meter" with the 
so-called "grind meter" which is filled up by 
performing stunts. Every grind decreases this 
meter and if it is empty no grinds can be 
performed at all. Of course grinds are an 
elemental move to beat the challenges. 
There is also a freestyle playing mode where the 
player can unlock new skaters. 
The soundtrack is licensed.

Alien Hominid is a 2D side-scrolling shooter with 
heavy references to the Metal Slug series of games 
- from the hand-drawn graphics, huge explosions, 
right down to the ability to eviscerate FBI Agents 
when you get up close to them.  The graphics are 
by featured artist Dan Paladin.  Your goal, is 
quite simply, to get to the end of the stage, and 
die as little as possible.  Which is made 
difficult due to the fact that any bullet is an 
instant kill. 
 
To help you out, you can grab a range of 
power-ups, such as lasers, spread shots, shotguns 
and more, as well as hijacking vehicles and using 
them for protection.  Grenades can be lobbed, and 
you can jump on enemy shoulders and choose to bite 
their heads off if you like, or pick them up and 
throw them at other enemies.  You can also dive 
underground for a short period of time to avoid 
enemies - while underground, you can drag agents 
into the ground to kill them. 
 
The GBA version of the game is identical in 
gameplay, however, with a few bosses removed (such 
as the robot bee and the FBI big-fisted tank 
robot).  The PlayStation 2, Xbox and Xbox 360 
versions of the game include a special "PDA Game" 
with very simple-looking graphics.  Your goal in 
this game is to kill all the agents by hopping on 
their heads, and then reach the exit.  Included 
with this game is a level editor, allowing you to 
make your own levels and then send them to friends 
if you have the Xbox or Xbox 360 version.

defeating a boss monster. 
 
While the background story asks for finding 6 
pieces of the lost map to a goldmine (hence the 6 
worlds), the basic task is to collect gold for 
points and extra lives. The gold also works as an 
indicator to see how much of a level has actually

Animaniacs - Lights, Camera, Action! (c) Aug 12, 
2005 Warthog Sweden / Ignition Entertainment Ltd. 
 
Warner Bros. Studios is in massive financial debt 
- one zillion dollars worth of debt, to be 
precise!  And it's all because of Yakko, Wakko, 
and Dot!  Their madcap destruction has caused this 
dire financial situation, and the CEO, Thaddeus 
Plotz, has issued an ultimatum: either deliver 
three feature films on time and as cheaply as 
possible...or be locked in the Water Tower 
forever! 
 
In Lights, Camera, Action!, the player controls 
all three Animaniacs, as well as Pinky and The 
Brain.  Each Animaniac has their own abilities and 
drawbacks - for example, The Brain can activate 
complex switches, but cannot jump due to his large 
head, while Dot can glide through the air with her 
skirt, but refuses to push anything as it will 
damage her nails.  It's up to the player to switch 
between each Animaniac as they make their way 
through each scene, performing the required tasks 
given by the director. 
 
The Animaniacs are also never in any real danger - 
they're only filming.  However, they must always 
pick up film reels to keep the cameras rolling.  
If the player runs out of film, it's game over.  
Otherwise, if you fall into water or get hurt, 
you'll just have to restart the last scene that 
the director asked you to perform.

Arctic Tale (c) Oct, 2007 Atomic Planet 
Entertainment Limited / Destination Software, Inc. 
 
Arctic Tale is based on the National Geography 
documentary of the same name. Players control a 
polar bear (both cub and adult) trying to survive 
in a harsh climate of snowy landscapes. There are 
eleven stages where the little bear explores the 
environment, searches for foods and collects paw 
prints that unlock pictures in a photo gallery and 
additional chapters. Later, two other animals can 
be controlled as well: a walrus that is also able 
to explore underwater environment, the fast Arctic 
fox able to hunt down rabbits and an orca whale. 
 
The levels consist of free-roaming environments, 
on land or underwater, where the animals need to 
gather food to avoid having the heart icon fade 
away. While playing 16 different mini-games can be 
accessed where the player can earn bronze, silver 
and golds awards to unlock additional chapters. 
These games include Ice Slide (obstacle course), 
Shuffle (slide to the center of a ring), Food 
Fight, Ice Flow Rodeo (control a broken piece of 
ice through rough currents), Survive the Cold 
(cross an icy area using shelters to hide from the 
cold), Catch-a-Seal, Ice Sheet, Clam Scavenge 
(find eight hidden clams), Herd Flow (guide an ice 
block without hitting anything), Walrus Hunt, Orca 
Race and more.

Sound of Thunder, A (c) Feb 01, 2005 Mobius 
Entertainment Ltd. / BAM! Entertainment, Inc. 
 
A Sound of Thunder is an overhead shoot-em-up 
based on the 2005 film, which in turn was loosely 
based on the classic short story by Ray Bradbury. 
It is Chicago, 2055, and you are Travis Ryer, 
scientist and employee at Time Safari Incorporated 
(TSI), a business dedicated to taking wealthy 
clients back in time 65 million years and giving 
them the chance to do the impossible: hunt a 
dinosaur. 
 
Of course, there are dangers: the tiniest change 
can screw the future up in ways you can't possibly 
imagine. Somehow, one of the recent clients has 
managed to accidentally take a butterfly back 
through time with him. Soon, the present is rocked 
by time waves, waves which gradually change the 
future into how the butterfly-less past would have 
been. Dinosaurs have been popping up around the 
city, buildings are crumbling and decaying, and 
the last wave that hits may mean the end of the 
human race unless Ryer can return the butterfly to 
the past. 
 
With a nice arsenal of weapons at your disposal, 
such as grenade launchers, machine guns, stun 
prods, and time freezing bombs that will freeze 
all enemies for a short amount of time, plus 
vehicles such as an ordinary car or a tricked-out 
ATV, you may just get the necessary edge. You can 
also battle it out in four-player deathmatch mode 
or a two-player cooperative mode. You may want to 
hurry, though: you're racing against time... and 
time is NOT on your side.

where you jump around obstacles and walk towards 
the right of the screen. Many enemies such as fake

into the sky. Each level is concluded with a 
mini-game. The game closely follows the events of

Astro Boy - Omega Factor (c) Aug 17, 2004 
Hitmaker|Treasure Co., Ltd. / SEGA of America, 
Inc. 
 
Astro Boy: Omega Factor is a side-scrolling action 
game based off a 2003 remake of Osamu Tezuka's 
classic Astro Boy anime and manga series from the 
1960s. You play as the young, boylike robot Astro 
Boy, a true mechanical pacifist who's biggest 
dream is that one day humans and robots can 
coexist in peace. Armed with a strong punch, 
rocket powered feet and the ability to shoot 
laserbeams from your fingers, arms and behind, you 
set off on a quest against all sorts of evildoers 
from the Astro Boy series. 
 
The game has two distinctive types of levels: the 
more prevalent beat-em-up levels and the 
shooter-esque levels. During the beat-em-up levels 
you can walk around freely and your flying ability 
is limited to short bursts. The shooter levels 
differ from each other: sometimes you can float 
around the screen and shoot in both directions, 
other times you are flying in a set direction in a 
more on-the-rails fashion. 
 
The Omega Factor mentioned in the title is 
actually a simple upgrading system for your 
weapons. Every time Astro meets someone new (be 
they good or bad) he or she will be added to the 
Omega factor screen and Astro can upgrade one of 
his six weapons or abilities.

It's tough being an intergalactic superhero when 
you've got to finish your homework and make it in 
time to the basketball finals - but that's just 
what Atomic Betty, defender of the cosmos, has to 
do!  Take care of the spoiled Penelope with the 
help of your friends while you're on earth, then 
blast off into space and combat the villainous 
genius, Maximus I.Q. (Evil Master Mind). 
 
Atomic Betty is a mix of the platform and puzzle 
genres, and plays very similarly to The Lost 
Vikings, in that you control three different 
characters simultaneously, each with varying 
abilities.  However, because Atomic Betty is aimed 
at a younger audience, there are two notable 
differences: first, it is a lot more difficult to 
die, and second, the player only needs to get one 
character to the exit to successfully finish the 
level. 
 
When on Earth, the player controls one character 
that can finish the homework, one that can push or 
pull objects, and the last that can slide under 
narrow gaps.  In Space, one character can 
repeatedly attack and use special gadgets, one can 
use a jetpack for a very high jump, and the last 
can grab items and enemies.  In addition to the 
main levels, the game also features levels where 
the player must control the spaceship as it zooms 
through asteroid belts and high-speed space warps.

negative features (handling, speed, etc.). Finish 
each race above the needed result and you'll move 
onto the next level. Once you complete a circuit, 
you'll move up the rankings to harder tracks, 
better bikes and more difficult enemy AI riders.

Avatar - The Last Airbender - The Burning Earth 
(c) Oct, 2007 Halfbrick Studios Pty Ltd / THQ Inc. 
 
Based on the Avatar show, The Burning Earth 
follows Aang and his friends as they travel to the 
last remaining Earth Kingdom stronghold in search 
of Bumi, Aang's teacher and friend. 
 
Gameplay consists of brawling and puzzles. Each 
character has different moves, with each mission 
giving you different characters to control. While 
you directly control your main character, your 
secondary character can still assist in fights, 
and you can switch the primary and secondary 
characters at any time. The puzzles are based 
around your character's unique moves, and 
generally revolve around activating crystals.

Back To Stone is an isometric action game set in a 
world where humans have attained wisdom to 
overcome war and famine. However, someone traces 
down a black book and recites the words that 
unleash a horde of demons, vanquishing the humans. 
Some are kept alive as guinea pigs in dark 
experiments. One of their subjects, the nameless 
protagonist, managed to escape. He has been 
infused with a demonic essence that robs him from 
his human form, but grants him super strength and 
the ability to turn flesh into stone. 
 
The game provides at least a 10 to 15 hour-playing 
time, peppered with cinematics and dialogues. 
There are various objects throughout the quest in 
order to solve many enigmas and obtain magical 
powers. When things get harder, a small friendly 
helper will show up and guide the player through 
the dangerous world. 
 
This GBA game comes on a 32 Mb cartridge and offer 
about 20 different environments (desert, villages, 
ice lands, mazes, forest, swamp, lost cities…). 
Each environment has its own specificities of 
experiences and interactions (wind, water, 
sliding, moving pavement…). This world is 
inhabited by some 30 monsters and many Boss Master 
demons.

Batman - Vengeance (c) Oct 31, 2001 Ubi Soft 
Divertissements Inc. / Ubi Soft Entertainment, 
Inc. 
 
Trouble is brewing in Gotham City: The Joker has 
another nefarious plan for bringing down Batman. 
It begins with a break-in at the Gotham Museum and 
ends with the Joker falling from the Gotham 
Bridge, apparently to his death (as depicted in 
the first levels of gameplay). 
Now, Gotham's other supervillains, including Mr. 
Freeze and Poison Ivy don't rest and want to fill 
the void left by the Joker. Thankfully, Batman is 
not alone in his efforts to stop them, as his 
trusted companions Robin and Batgirl are there to 
help. 
 
Batman: Vengeance for the GBA has the same basic 
story as its counterpart on consoles (and uses 
stills from that version's rendered sequences for 
story cutscenes), but differs in gameplay. Both 
games are inspired by the 1990s Batman animated TV 
series rather than the comics. 
 
The game has four different kinds of levels: 
 
In the side-scrolling levels, Batman runs and 
jumps from left to right, beating up various 
henchmen with kicks and punches. He can also use 
various gadgets: batarangs and smoke bombs to take 
out enemies and a grappling hook to reach 
otherwise inaccessible areas. 
 
In the Batmobile stages, viewed from the top, the 
Batmobile has to reach a goal within a certain 
time limit. Naturally, the road is filled with 
both traffic and other obstacles that take time 
from the clock or slow Batman down. Thankfully, 
the Batmobile is equipped with a gun that can take 
some obstacles out of the way. 
 
It's Robin and Batgirl's turn in the Batplane 
stages, which are similar to traditional 
side-scrolling shoot'em'ups. The Batplane has to 
be steered through an automatically scrolling 
landscape, filled with flying hazards and various 
guns. The plane can be made invulnerable for a 
short time by employing an energy shield, and it 
is also equipped with a gun to fight back. 
 
Finally, Robin goes at it solo in the so-called 
Puzzle stages. Viewed from the top, Robin must 
navigate a labyrinth of rooms and find the exit. 
Crates block the way that have to be moved in the 
correct order to free the path. Passwords and key 
cards must be found to open barriers. To gain 
access to areas behind holes that are too small to 
pass through, a remote-controlled robot called the 
Batcrawler can be used. These stages also have 
enemies to be defeated. 
 
Once the game has been finished in Story Mode, a 
password is given out for Advance Mode. Advance 
Mode features slightly different versions of the 
original levels with different goals: in the 
side-scrolling, Puzzle and Batmobile levels, three 
data disks must be collected and the end of the 
level reached before a timer runs out. In the 
Batplane levels, the Joker has placed three "Pyro 
toys", which have to be destroyed, again before a 
timer runs out.

In a twist for the series, Beyblade VForce: 
Ultimate Blader Jam is not based on spinning top 
battles. Instead, the game bears a closer 
resemblance to Marble Madness. In each level, 
you'll need to get your top to the exit, 
negotiating narrow paths, and watching out for 
enemies. There are collectibles in each level, 
called Bit Beasts, and each level has a par time 
to beat. Of course, you're controlling a top, not 
a marble, and so you have a spin gauge. The lower 
this gauge gets, the harder your top will be to 
control, and the closer you are to losing. The 
story features a group of mysterious strangers who 
are systematically beating the world Beyblade 
champions. 
 
This game also has a multiplayer mode. Battle 
against a friend in the battle mode, and try to 
knock your opponent's Beyblade off the level, or 
just stay spinning longer. There is also a race 
mode, which challenges you to reach the exit 
before your opponent.

Bionicle - Heroes (c) Nov 14, 2006 Amaze 
Entertainment, Inc. / Eidos, Inc.|TT Games 
Publishing Ltd 
 
In the GBA version of Bionicle Heroes, based on 
the LEGO Bionicle franchise, players take on the 
guise of the TOA Anika team. Set on the island of 
Voya Nui, they need to retrieve the Mask of Life, 
stolen by the Piraka race who also enslaved the 
Matoran, the native inhabitants, in the process. 
Unlike the console and the DS versions, a top-down 
perspective is used. 
 
The game takes place on six zones of the island, 
followed by a final showdown. The player starts as 
a TOA of Fire, but by completing zones and killing 
the level boss, additional masks can be collected: 
Air, Stone, Ice, Earth and Water. Each TOA has a 
primary and secondary weapon based on the mask's 
elemental nature, with specific features. During 
the levels, there are also weapon upgrades to be 
found. The second weapon is limited by an energy 
meter which needs some time to recharge. Each zone 
requires a specific TOA guise, but in the Free 
Play mode completed levels can be revisited and 
players can then switch between the forms at any 
time to use different abilities. TOAs can strafe 
while fighting - there is an option to face 
enemies automatically or to control this manually. 
 
TOAs are assisted by proto-spawn orbs, sidekicks 
that circle around the hero and fire at enemies. 
The orbs are chased off when they take too much 
damage, but they can also be upgraded based on the 
6 elements and the weapons can be customized. 
Players can define to have the orbs fire in spread 
patterns or rapid bursts, lock on targets with 
fire, cause explosions, fire through shields or do 
double damage. Additional attacks are provided 
through elemental runes, which provide a one-time 
limited effect, such as freezing enemies, 
activating a lightning shield, smashing enemies 
with spikes from the ground, temporary 
invulnerability, full health and regeneration, and 
a fire blast. 
 
By destroying objects and buildings in the 
environment, blue, gray or gold LEGO pieces are 
revealed, providing health and bonus points. The 
TOAs also need to use pieces to build bridges, 
platforms, elevators, turrets, barricades or 
moving platforms. At the end of each zone, the 
rank and score is shown. Based on the performance 
or specific actions, there are 12 medals to 
collect, of which a few can only be found in the 
Free Play mode. 
 
Each zone contains secret cheat words. Upon 
discovering them, they are added to a cheat menu. 
They allow to play as a golden TOA or to obtain a 
new mask with a sombrero, open up a music jukebox, 
provide a hidden Cluck gun or grant invincibility 
or one-shot kills.

The player controls all of the six Toa Metru, and 
he has to use their individual special skills to 
overcome the challenges thrown at him. During the 
course of the game, each Toa Metru can enhance gis 
special skills, each representing a different 
element (ice, air, earth, fire, stone, and water). 
While the standard gameplay takes place from a 
top-down view, combat is played out in turn-based 
fashion similar to Golden Sun.

Black Matrix Zero (c) Aug 30, 2002 Flight-Plan / 
NEC Interchannel, Ltd. 
 
This installment of the Black/Matrix series is set 
in the same universe, a world which is populated 
by angels with white bird-like wings, demons with 
black bat-like wings, and wingless humans. For 
many years, the war between angels and demons has 
been going on. You control an ordinary boy named 
Cain. You live on a secluded island as a servant 
of a woman named Matia, far away and seemingly 
safe from the battle areas. But as both demons and 
angels seem to be interested in Matia and she gets 
kidnapped eventually, Cain realizes he must do 
everything to save her, and becomes involved in 
the great struggle. 
 
This is a strategy RPG with turn-based combat, in 
which you navigate your party members on the 
isometric battle screen and attack or use magic 
spells when the enemy is in range. Story sequences 
occur between battles which take up most of the 
gameplay.

Blackthorne is an action-adventure game that takes 
place on the planet Tuul. Tuul was a peaceful 
place, until the evil warrior Sarlac used the 
power of the Darkstone to take control.  
Blackthorne's father, the good King Vlaros, sent 
him to Earth just as his kingdom crumbled around 
him.  Now, 20 years later, Blackthorne is grown 
and must return to Tuul to free it from the 
clutches of Sarlac. 
 
This game is played from a side-view with 
non-scrolling backgrounds. It has strong 
similarities to Prince of Persia, except you 
battle your foes using guns and bombs instead of a

Django has been stripped of his valuable weapon of

your chances of survival. 
 
The sequel to Boktai: The Sun is in Your Hand 
combines the classic RPG adventure of old with 
survival and stealth elements. Of course, the sun 
sensor returns in-built into the cartridge, and 
you must use the light of the sun to build up the

Boktai - The Sun is in Your Hand (c) Sep 16, 2003 
Konami JPN / Konami of America, Inc. 
 
Following in his father's footsteps, you play 
Django the vampire hunter, who uses the power of 
the sun to defeat the many evil beings that infest 
the world. Search out the various levels for the 
evil inside, and destroy the immortal that rules 
the area to complete the level. 
 
This isometric platformer does not have you 
fighting evil with the usual assortment of weapons 
and devices, but it will have you playing 
outdoors. The inbuilt sunlight sensor on the 
cartridge detects levels of sunlight, which 
determines not only the time of day you play, but 
also acts as ammo for your weapon. Run out of 
sunlight, or play in the dark, and evil will have 
the upperhand. 
 
Many elements to the sunlight can have an effect 
on how the game plays out. For example, you can 
only replenish ammo during play by standing 
outside or, if indoors, under light from a window. 
Sunlight batteries can be collected during play to 
store sunlight, so you can play at night.

Bomberman was a robot in a bomb making factory who 
longed for his freedom. Rumors circulated that 
escaping to the surface would allow the robot to 
become human. Getting out would be the trick. Each 
room is inhabited by monsters that must be 
neutralized and the exit itself hidden underneath 
bricks. 
 
The first of the Bomberman series. Bomberman is a 
single player game with a top down view and 
simplistic controls. In fact, in addition to 
movement, you only have a single ability: placing 
bombs. Each bomb explodes into a cross-shaped 
blast (4 directions) which can destroy either 
enemies or blocks. Power-ups may be found to 
increase the size of the blast, place additional 
bombs, increase the speed of the Bomberman or to 
walk through walls. Your goal on each level is to 
destroy all enemies and escape through the exit 
before the time limit is up.. Hitting the exit 
with a bomb blast releases more enemies which must 
also be destroyed.

Bit Generations Boundish (c) Jul 13, 2006 Skip, 
Ltd. / Nintendo Co., Ltd. 
 
Boundish is a series of five different two player 
games, mostly based around the very first video 
game ever made, Pong.  You can choose to play 
these games either versus a CPU opponent, or 
head-to-head against another player.  Player one 
is always red, and player two is always blue.  The 
games are: 
 
Pool Flower 
Two players bounce a ball left and right between 
each other, aiming to get it past the opposing 
player to score a point.  Players can move up and 
down the entirety of the screen, as well as 
forward and back about a third of the screen.  
Circles of varying size float around the screen - 
if these are hit, they turn the same color as the 
last player who hit the ball away. 
 
Box Juggling 
The odd game out of the bunch - this game is 
instead based on Nintendo's very first Game & 
Watch game, Ball.  One player walks left and right 
at the bottom of the screen, keeping a box in the 
air.  If the box hits the ground, it's game over.  
Pressing A makes the player push the box back in 
the air - if the player hits the box with their 
head, it still counts as a hit, but the player is 
briefly stunned.  Power ups and additional boxes 
appear as the game progresses to keep things 
different. 
 
Power Slider 
Two players stand around the edge of a 
binocular-shaped field.  They bounce a puck 
between each other, and each time it bounces, it 
leaves a hole in the playfield.  Players can hold 
the A Button and let it go just as the puck 
approaches them to perform a power shot.  Players 
hug their circular side of the playfield to take 
shots at the puck. 
 
Human League 
The screen is divided into two sides, and two 
human-shaped paddles are on each side.  The game 
plays somewhat like doubles tennis, in that if the 
first player misses the ball, the second player 
has a chance to recover it.  Using Up and Down 
moves both players (the second player moves more 
slowly), while Left and Right moves the player 
closer to the net only.  Pressing A while holding 
Up or Down will make the outer player make a dash 
for the corner in that direction. 
 
Wild Go Round 
This game has the two players rotating around a 
vinyl record.  The goal is to get the opponent to 
drop the ball off the record.  Each time a player 
hits the ball, the record rotates, and the label 
changes color.  If the label is the same color as 
your player, you will score a point.  The record's 
rotation also affects the movement of the ball.

Ryu was a young boy who has memories of a strange 
village far away and a magical doorway which 
sucked him through. However those are only distant 
memories. Ryu and his best friend Bow are 
apprentices in the Ranger's Guild. As adventurers 
they take on posted jobs needed by the 
townspeople. However it isn't long before one job 
goes awry and Bow is accused of stealing a 
valuable item. In order to clear his friend's name 
and find the meaning of his dreams, Ryu will 
explore the world, eventually discovering the 
meaning of his dreams and hidden abilities inside 
himself. 
 
Breath of Fire II is a role playing game. The 
majority of game is played from a top-down map, 
however battles are seen from an isometric view. 
Ryu will form parties from among 8 other 
characters, each with their own set of skills and 
powers that will help him discover the truth 
behind the mystery. 
 
In the GBA version, you can use a link-cable to 
link to a friends and exchange weapons and items

Every hundred years, the dark vampire known as 
Dracula resurrects and terrorizes the land. A 
vampire hunter named Simon Belmont bravely 
ventures into the Count's mansion in order to 
defeat him. Along the way he'll have to defeat 
skeletons, bats, fishmen, medusa heads and other 
evil creatures. 
 
Castlevania is a side-scrolling platform action 
game. The player taking the role of Simon Belmont 
is able to jump and crack his whip directly in 
front of him. Power-ups can be obtained by 
defeating enemies or by whipping candles that 
appear in the castle. One such power-up increases 
the power and length of Simon's whip.  Different 
weapons can be gathered which consume hearts when 
used, these hearts can also be collected from 
monsters and candles. Additionally, some walls 
will hide secrets such as the health-restorative 
turkey or the Double and Triple shot abilities for 
the weapons Simon has collected. At the end of 
each section of the castle is a boss, which must 
be defeated. Progression through the castle 
eventually leads to a confrontation with Count 
Dracula himself.

Castlevania - Aria of Sorrow (c) May 06, 2003 
Konami Computer Entertainment Tokyo, Inc. / Konami

Normally a solar eclipse isn't a dangerous event, 
but for Soma Cruz being sucked through a portal 
and into Dracula's castle during one will turn his 
day into a total nightmare. As Soma you must 
venture through the castle and find a way out. As 
you do so, you will discover the true meaning 
behind the event, and why Dracula has risen yet 
again. 
 
Although set in the future, all of the weapons and 
hazards are the same or similar to those seen in 
past Castlevania titles. Soma can find or buy 
weapons of all types such as swords, spears, and 
axes. Through his mysterious power of Dominance 
Soma can take the souls of his enemies and use 
their powers as his own, providing passive stat 
boosts, powerful magic, or even summoning them 
forth to fight on his behalf. Dracula's castle is 
a single continuous building, and as Soma's power 
of Dominance grows and he acquires more monster 
souls to power abilities he can bypass obstacles 
that were previously insurmountable. Players can 
link up with a friend's copy of Castlevania: Aria 
of Sorrow to trade souls between them.

Castlevania - Circle of the Moon (c) Jun 11, 2001 
Konami Computer Entertainment Kobe, Inc. / Konami 
of America, Inc. 
 
Count Dracula has been resurrected and evil will 
reign supreme unless he is stopped.  As Nathan 
Graves, you'll hunt down the Count and use your 
whip and a variety of special items to destroy his 
minions.  Battle your way through Dracula's castle 
and rid the world of his evil once again. 
 
Castlevania: Circle of the Moon is the first of 
the series to be based on the action/RPG structure 
of Castlevania:Symphony of the Night rather than 
the level-based action style of all previous 
Castlevania games. Dracula's castle is a single 
continuous building, and as Nathan discovers 
artifacts within it he gains new abilities that 
allow him to explore more of it. While Nathan can 
only use his Killer Whip as a weapon, he can find 
and equip different kinds of armor and accessories 
that change his stats. Unique to this entry in the 
series is the Dual Set-up System, where a 
combination of two cards will give Nathan unique 
magical abilities. For example, equipping a fire 
type card with a whip card will give the Killer 
Whip a fire attribute, while equipping it with a 
summon card will let Nathan summon a fire demon to 
attack onscreen enemies.

Konami Computer Entertainment Tokyo, Inc. / Konami

Castlevania: Harmony of Dissonance is the second 
Castlevania game to appear on the Game Boy 
Advance. Juste Belmont and friend Maxim are drawn 
to the newly resurrected Dracula's Castle in order 
to save their mutual friend Lydie, although it 
remains to be seen who will be saving whom. 
 
The game is another Castlevania in the action/RPG 
style of the previous Castlevania: Symphony of the 
Night and Castlevania: Circle of the Moon. Juste 
is able to dash at will similar to Alucard, and 
use subweapons like the axe and holy water. By 
combining subweapons with magic tomes located 
throughout the castle he can increase both their 
power and their properties, such as turning the 
holy water into a rain that damages every monster 
onscreen, or turning a Bible into a holy shield 
that circles him. Juste can equip many kinds of 
armor and accessories, and he can modify his 
Vampire Killer whip with different tips that 
change its elemental property or increase its 
power. As an optional side quest, Juste can also 
find furniture and furnishings left around the 
castle and decorate a room with them, although 
there is no reward for doing so beyond a nice 
looking room.

The Game Boy Advance version of the Catwoman movie 
license is a straightforward isometric action/

the key abilities of the cat-lady as seen in the 
movie, and must traverse levels full of platforms 
and "bad guys", and climbing walls, occasionally. 
 
The game opens with a tutorial mission and then 
switches to a series of images resembling 
comic-strips that explain how Patience Phillips 
became Catwoman. The player then goes through the 
24 levels of the game mostly jumping, climbing and 
sometimes fighting. 
 
The look of the graphics aims toward a comic-book 
feel instead of the more realistic looking 3D of 
the console and PC versions.

Championship Manager Quiz (c) Apr 01, 2002 King of 
the Jungle Ltd. / Eidos Interactive, Inc. 
 
Championship Manager Quiz is the unexpected result 
of developer Sports Interactive looking to branch 
out from their successful football management 
series called, funnily enough, Championship 
Manager. 
 
If you think a quiz game may not be the best use 
of their skills then think again. This isn't just 
a collection of thousands of football trivia 
questions with points scored for each correct 
answer - that would be too simple. The football 
fans at Sports Interactive have managed to create 
a quiz game that not only mixes football knowledge 
but also the rules and tactics involved in the 
sport too. 
 
The quiz is played out like a real game of 
football. You see the pitch and two sets of teams 
and get to pick who you want to play as at the 
start. The idea is to pick your favourite team as 
the questions will really probe your love for the 
club. From the kick-off, you must pass the ball 
around the field by answering questions correctly. 
Below the shirt of each player are question 
categories. Pass the ball to that player and 
answer the question correctly to keep possession. 
Of course, answer a question incorrectly and the 
ball goes to the opposition. Get the ball to a 
striker, answer the question correctly and you've 
scored. Whoever gets the most questions correct is 
irrelevant

free 2003 flash game of the same name. The player, 
controlling Chicken Bill, shoots all the chickens 
that appear on the 2D hand-drawn screens, shown 
from a first-person perspective. There are 3 game 
modes: 
 
1. Arcade: shoot a specific number of chickens 
   to move on to the next level. There is no time 
   limit and the enemies attack by throwing eggs 
   towards the screen. There is no time limit and 
   when Chicken Bill's 100 points are depleted, 
   the game is over. 
 
2. Classic: the same gameplay as Arcade, 
   requiring a certain number of chickens to be 
   shot, but now with a time limit added. Certain 
   chickens carry time packages, providing time 
   bonuses. 
 
3. Multiplayer: score more points than your 
   opponent in a set amount of time. 
 
There are three difficulty levels and support for 
high scores (not saved after powering off). At the 
end of each level, statistics are shown based on 
the shots fired, hits, accuracy, general score, 
and energy or time remaining. There are different 
types of weapons (pistol, shotgun, uzi, machine 
gun, laster, flame thrower and bombs) and a 
limited amount of ammo. During gameplay, accuracy 
is shown through a thermometer on the screen. When 
it rises to the top, all hits are awarded with 
double points.

CIMA - The Enemy (c) Nov 18, 2003 Neverland Co., 
Ltd. / Natsume, Inc. 
 
The CIMA aliens feed on humankind hopes and 
dreams. They build elaborate mazes and trap people 
inside them as a way of producing their food. A 
force called "Gate Guardians" was created to 
protect the population from this menace. Three 
Guardians were on a train delivering settlers to a 
distant station, when suddenly a portal for 
another dimension appeared and transported 
everyone to a strange moon-like place. The 
Guardians must find the way home and bring back 
safely every passenger. 
 
CIMA: The Enemy is a RPG with strategic elements. 
Although labeled a RPG, the game doesn't have the 
usual trappings of the genre: there is no 
levelling up, nor any form of currency or shops to 
buy equipment. Instead, the game is focused on the 
management of a huge party of characters (16 by 
the end of the game). The main objective is to 
guide these civilians on mazes, using their unique 
abilities to overcome obstacles and defeat 
enemies. Each character has a special trait that 
can be used to the player's advantage (a medic 
that concots health potions, a blacksmith that 
upgrades armor and weapons, etc). 
 
Pressing the R button brings up a cross with the 
party portraits at each point and a multicolor 
cross on the middle. The characters can be 
individually guided by selecting their portraits 
or moved in groups by selecting the multicolor 
cross. Three way-points can be set for easier 
manouvering (almost a necessity, the characters 
have a tendency to get stuck on corners and 
walls). The groups to be moved can be selected by 
hitting the L button (a cross with numbered tents 
at each point appears). 
 
One crucial gameplay aspect is the amount of trust 
the party members have on their Guardians. Each 
character has a gauge that shows the amount of 
trust they have. This number increases and 
decreases according to actions within the game. If 
a character is hurt his/her trust decreases, and a 
red heart with an arrow pointing downwards appears 
over his/her head. Likewise, if a character sees a 
guardian slaying a monster the opposite effect 
happens, and a green heart with an upwards arrow 
appears over his/her head. Trust is important 
because the characters only cooperate with the 
Guardians when they have the right amount of it. 
 
Using the START button brings up a cross with the 
following functions: 
 
? The south point has a wrench icon. It accesses 
the game options menu that can save the game (at 
any time), quit it or change the text speed. 
 
? The north point has a face with a speech ballon 
icon. It is the dialogue screen, where the 
characters speak about the situation and how they 
are feeling. 
 
? The middle of the cross has a sword and a potion 
icon. It is the inventory screen, where potions 
and other items can be equipped on a cross. The 
main character's inventory cross can be accessed 
in-game by pressing the A button. The other 
characters use items automatically when needed 
(they don't equip them automatically, though). 
 
? The east point has a stylized file of people 
icon. This is the group screen, where characters 
can be organized in groups for easier management 
and manouvering. 
 
? The west point has a stylized body and heart 
icon. It is the statistics screen, where the 
player can check what weapons, stats and armor 
each character has. 
 
The top-left of the main game screen shows the 
health points bar of the main character. Below 
that occasionally is shown a health bar of any 
near party member being attacked. When a party 
character is about to expire, a jewel is displayed 
besides the main character's health bar, and an 
alarm sound is played. Death of any party member 
ends the game instantaneously.

Sword series. It is a third-person point-and-click 
adventure entirely in 2D. The player controls 
George Stobbart, an American tourist spending his 
autumn vacation in Paris. He barely escapes a 
bombing of a café and decides to investigate the 
clues left behind by the killer. This eventually 
leads him to a mystery dating back to the legend 
of the Knights Templar. 
 
The game is entirely in 2D and gameplay is in 
typical point-and-click fashion. The player moves 
the character around using the mouse, examines the 
environment, talks to other people and collect 
items stored in an inventory. These items need to 
be used or combined with other items to solve 
puzzles. George gets help from Nicole Collard, a 
French journalist. 
 
The story has been divided into eleven chapters 
and takes place in locations such as Paris, 
Ireland, Syria, Spain and Scotland.

closer to the color of the cursor (for example, if 
you select a red tile when the cursor is blue, the 
red tile will become purple).  There are also two 
special tiles which can be cleared: one clears all 
tiles on-screen of one color

Sketch Turner was a starving comic book artist, 
living with his pet rat Roadkill... that is until 
a lightning storm mysteriously brought his cartoon 
villain, Mortus, to life and imprisoned Sketch 
within the pages of his own comic book. Now 
trapped in the world that he himself created, but 
someone else is now drawing, Sketch must battle 
through the pages of his own comic book, and past 
his own creations, to a final battle with Mortus. 
Perhaps one of his own creations, General Alissa 
Cyan might be able to help... 
 
Comix Zone is a side-scrolling fighting game with 
a difference, you're inside of a comic book and 
you yourself know it. Smash enemies into the sides 
of frames, rip through the paper to unleash a 
super move and otherwise wreck havoc throughout 
the limitations of the graphic novel. Sketch 
himself can jump, attack and use various items 
that he finds along the comic book, including his 
rat friend, Roadkill. Button combinations can be 
used to unleash powerful techniques. 
 
The game progresses linear through each page of 
the comic book, however secret paths and alternate 
routes through the story can be discovered. At the 
end of each level, Sketch receives a super hero 
rating for how well he's progressing.

The GBA version was licensed separately, and only 
the characters remind of the Crazy Frog world. The 
typical music and soundbites are not present. 
 
Only singleplayer is available, and no story at 
all. The main game modes are Grand Prix, two modes 
based on checkpoints (alone or against opponents), 
and Last Man Standing where the last one drops 
after each lap. Grand Prix consists of three 
classes based on different speed, with three cups 
each, and and extra cup. Controls allow for 
speeding up, braking, using items to hinder your 
opponents (mines, nails, boxing gloves...), and 
there is a button to drift through the corners. 
Record times can be saved on the Battery Backed

CT Special Forces (c) Jun, 2002 Light & Shadow 
Production / Light & Shadow Production 
 
CT Special Forces is a side scrolling platform 
shooter that has a superficial similarity to the 
games of the Metal Slug series. The player 
controls an operative of a counter-terrorist force 
on a mission around the globe to stop terrorist 
activity and arrest its leaders. The digital pad 
moves the character, while the B button shoots the 
weapon and the A button makes the character jump. 
The character can't shoot downwards. The L trigger 
cycles through the inventory (displayed on the 
top-left corner of the screen) and the R trigger 
throws grenades (when they are available). By 
selecting an ammunition type, the character uses 
the corresponding weapon (gas canisters for the 
flamethrower, machine gun pents for that weapon, 
etc). The default rifle has an infinite number of 
bullets. Other items include a grappling rope and 
a pair of handcuffs to arrest surrended enemies. 
Ammunition and health packs are scattered 
throughout the levels, as are proximity mines and 
assorted enemies. 
 
The regular gameplay is occasionally broke by 
mini-games and entirely different sections: when 
the character collides with a reticule placard, 
the game switches to a first-person shooting 
gallery where the player has to shoot down a 
certain number of terrorists and rescue the 
hostages. When colliding with a parachute, two 
gauges with a red line on the middle appear on the 
screen. The one on the left measures the position 
of the falling character and the one on the right 
measures height. The character must be guided to 
the right spot, and the shooting button must be 
pressed when both gauges reach the red bar. Some 
mission stages change the game to a vertical 
shooter that recalls Tiger-Heli and similar games, 
where the player controls a helicopter viewed from 
the top. 
 
The game has 4 missions, each with its own theme: 
snow mountain, desert, jungle and a city. A 
password system is provided  (the password is 
displayed after the completion of every mission).

CT Special Forces 2 - Back in The Trenches (c) 
Jun, 2003 Light & Shadow Production / Light &

CT Special Forces: Back to Hell is the sequel to 
CT Special Forces and the story picks up right 
where the last game ended. Having destroyed the 
terrorist group Network the CT Special Forces are 
going back to do training missions, but more and 
more reports about new terror threats keep popping 
up. Could this be a new terrorist organization, or 
maybe Network is back for a second round? It's up 
to the CT Special Forces to stop the treat of 
terrorism once again! 
 
The game plays in 5 different game modes. The 
majority is made up of side scrolling platform 
action, somewhat similar to the Metal Slug games, 
where you pick up various weapons, grenades and 
even a tank to squash the terrorist threat. Every 
now and then you'll come across a wooden sign with 
a cross-hair on it. Doing so will change the game 
into first person view, where you have to shoot 
terrorists and save hostages. Sometimes you'll 
find a parachute pack, and you'll have to play a 
mini game where you have to make two meters align 
to make a drop successfully with your parachute. 
 
There are also two kinds of helicopter stages. One 
is a top down shoot'em up, where you have to bomb 
land targets and gun down enemy helicopters. The 
other one is a side scrolling chopper rescue game, 
where you have to save hostages and bring them to 
your base, while gunning down enemies across the 
stage.

Darius R (c) Dec 13, 2002 Rideon Incorporated / 
PCCW Japan 
 
Darius R is a Japan-only remake of the original 
Darius for the GBA. It places you in the cockpit 
of the Silverhawk once again in order to defeat 
the forces of intergalactic fish threatening the 
galaxy in standard side-scrolling space shooter 
fare. 
 
Standout features include the use of the classic 
Darius level selection scheme that allows the game 
to branch in different stages and thus offer a 
series of different endings depending on what road 
you take. Unique for this GBA remake is the 
ability to play each stage individually (once you 
unlock it in the main campaign) in a level-select 
mode.

Defender (c) Nov, 2002 OutLook Entertainment, Inc. 
/ Midway Home Entertainment, Inc. 
 
Released in conjunction with a 3D update of the 
classic arcade game on consoles, the Game Boy 
Advance version is also an update of the original, 
but retains its side-scrolling gameplay. 
 
The cartridge includes several variants of the 
game. The main mode is called "XGP". Its basics 
are the same as in the original: The player's 
spaceship flies left or right over a scrolling 
landscape that wraps around after a few screens. 
The goal is destroy all invading aliens before 
they can capture the humans sitting on the ground. 
Besides updated graphics with various backgrounds 
and sprites for the enemies and humans, there are 
other differences as well: players can select from 
different ships, all with slightly different 
weapons and ratings for shields and speed. The XGP 
mode offers six different levels to complete. It 
can also be played by two players over the System 
Link. 
 
The cartridge also includes "Classic" mode, which 
is a port of the original arcade game. Finally, 
"XG" mode is the same gameplay-wise as Classic, 
but has been updated with graphics similar to the 
XGP mode.

Defender of the Crown (c) Oct 08, 2002 Cinemaware 
Corporation / Metro3D, Inc. 
 
Defender of the Crown puts you in the role of one 
of four Saxon knights in medieval England, in a 
time where the land is in turmoil as the King is 
dead and his crown was stolen. The Saxons and the 
Normans blame each other and fight for control of 
England. 
 
After a short introduction by Robin of Locksley 
himself, you start the game with a single castle 
and 10 soldiers at your command. From there, you 
have to build your army, take control of 
additional territories and fight the three Norman 
lords - and sometimes your Saxon friends as well. 
 
The game has several different styles: You may 
either engage in a jousting contest where you have 
to knock your opponent off his horse using a 
lance, you can go raid a castle for loot or you 
can attack another territory/castle. 
 
The game was originally created on the Amiga 
platform in 1986 by Cinemaware with wonderful 
graphics by James D. Sachs and great music by Jim 
Cuomo, then ported to the PC whilst keeping its 
original appeal and quality.

A top-down racing game where you race on tracks in 
various countries.  As you race, be sure to pick 
up any power-ups such as money and repairs.  You 
should also avoid running into things very much as 
your car will explode if you have too much damage. 
 If you are smart, you can slow your opponents 
down a lot by running into them in certain ways, 
however. 
 
Play the game in quick race, or tournament mode, 
or choose to play a friend in link mode.  Race 
each track and try to set records as you strive 
for first place in each track and your name in the 
high scores list. 
 
If you play in the tournament mode, you can buy 
upgrades for your car between each race.  This is 
not an option for the quick race mode.

Ogura, the villain from Densetsu no Stafi, is 
furious at his defeat at the hands of Stafi, the 
starfish prince.  After escaping from his prison, 
he kidnaps the queen, and whisks her away to a far 
off land.  Stafi must travel across the kingdom to 
rescue his mother and defeat Ogura once again. 
 
Densetsu no Stafi 2 is the sequel to the original 
Game Boy Advance game.  As Stafi, you can swim 
around freely in the water, as well as run, jump 
and later glide in the air while out of water.  
You'll receive help from Kyorosuke the Clam, your 
mentor, as you play.  Stafi's goal in each level 
is to find the treasure chest and grab it.  
However, access to each chest is usually blocked 
off until you complete a specific task for a 
character in the level, such as destroying a 
particular amount of enemies or finding certain 
items. 
 
Once you make your way through all the levels in a 
world, you'll have to face a boss.  It's you 
versus them - the first to lose five hit points 
will lose.  Each boss can only be hit during a 
particular time or in a particular area.  Once you 
beat the boss, it's onto the next world for more 
levels to beat and another boss to conquer.

After defeating Ogura in Densetsu no Stafi 2, 
Stafi has earned a break.  However, Ogura manages 
to escape once more, causing havoc across the 
kingdom as he flees.  Stafi must track him down, 
and this time his little sister Stapi is along for 
the ride as well. 
 
Densetsu no Stafi 3 is the third game in the 
Densetsu no Stafi series, and the first to 
introduce a new playable character.  Players 
control both Stafi, and his younger pink sister 
Stapi.  While Stafi retains his original moves, 
Stapi has some tricks of her own, such as a wall 
jump and crawling through narrow gaps, which allow 
her to access places that Stafi can't. 
 
The goal of each level is to reach the bonus 
roulette at the end of each stage.  This is done 
by performing tasks for characters, as the path to 
the roulette is initially blocked off.  Tasks 
usually consist of finding an item, destroying 
enemies, or defeating a boss.  Along the way, 
Stafi and Stapi will learn additional moves which 
will allow them to access areas that were 
previously unreachable. 
 
Players can collect orbs within the level - these 
both serve as the game's currency and health.  
Bonus orbs can also be earned by scoring 
consecutive enemy hits within a time period.  Orbs 
can be used to purchase outfits for Stafi to wear.

Dexter's Lab - Chess Challenge (c) 2002 Virtucraft 
Studios, Ltd. / BAM! Entertainment, Ltd. 
 
Dexter's Laboratory: Chess Challenge is a game 
based on the popular cartoon TV show of the same 
name. This chess game is a game mainly aimed at 
children who aren't normally interested in chess 
or board games and would be more easily convinced 
into learning how to play by playing a video game 
starring characters from the hit show. 
 
Players can choose from 4 selectable characters 
from the cartoon series and there are also 4 
different gameplay types to choose from. 
 
Tournament Mode 
In Tournament Mode, the player begins as a 
character and has to fight the other three 
characters in a chess match. It's pretty simple to 
figure out, since it's just normal chess. 
 
Versus Mode 
Versus Mode is a two-player mode which can be 
played with one GBA, where both players alternate 
control of the console or it can be played with 
two GBAs using the Link Cable. Players can choose 
their character and play chess. 
 
Quick Play 
This plays just like tournament mode except 
players only face one person. Players choose their 
own character and play a single game of chess 
against the computer. 
 
Puzzle mode 
The most complex game mode. The player has to 
clear the chess board by using his or her wits and 
different combinations of moves. This is the main 
part of the game. There are many different levels 
where the player has to find the correct solution.

Bit Generations Dial Hex (c) Jul 13, 2006 Skip, 
Ltd. / Nintendo Co., Ltd. 
 
Dialhex is a simple puzzle game for the Game Boy 
Advance.  While it looks similar to Hexic on the 
surface, it is actually quite different.  The play 
field for Dialhex is a large hexagonal bin.  
Triangles of different colors fall from the top of 
the bin, and react to gravity to fall to the 
bottom-most centre of the bin.  Using the Control 
Pad, players can move a hexagonal cursor around 
the bin, and rotate any of the triangles around by 
using L or R.  To clear the bin, players must 
rotate the triangles to fit six triangles of the 
same color together.  The hexagon then disappears, 
and any remaining triangles fall to the centre of 
the pile. 
 
Dialhex has two special triangles that can help 
you as you play.  If you slot a white flashing 
triangle into your colored hexagon, when the 
hexagon clears, it will also clear all triangles 
in the bin of the same color.  If you slot a black 
flashing triangle into your hexagon, when the 
hexagon clears, a beam of light will cut through 
the bin, and assorted triangles will pour through 
the bottom of the bin for a short period of time. 
 
Dialhex features two modes of play.  The first 
mode is Solo - in this mode, you start with two 
different types of colored triangles pouring into 
the bin.  Your aim is to complete six hexagons of 
each color - when you do this, a new color will be 
added to the bin, and so on. 
 
In Endless mode, you aim for the highest score 
possible.  There is no real goal in this mode 
except to survive.  In both modes, the game is 
over if your bin fills entirely to the top.

Dig Dug is a 1-2 player arcade game in which you 
have to use your shovel to dig your way through 
the earth. Stopping you from doing this are two 
monsters, called Pooka and Fygar, who will 
continually chase you around. The only weapon that 
you carry is an air pump, which you can use to 
inflate the monsters to the point where they 
explode. (if you start to inflate them but stop 
doing so, the monsters will get turned back to 
their normal selves.) Furthermore, rocks are 
scattered throughout the earth, and you can use 
these rocks to squash them. If the monsters do not 
find you for several seconds, they will eventually 
get turned into ghosts, which are able to walk 
through the earth. They are invincible and cannot 
be killed. From time to time, vegetables will 
appear in the center, and you can get these for 
points.

The Digimon prove themselves to be versatile 
creatures as they hop in cars and compete against 
each other in this kart-style racing game. 
 
The third Digimon game for the Game Boy Advance, 
Digimon Racing has all the features you'd expect 
out of a racing game. There's a good variety of 
colorful and light-hearted tracks (15 in all, 
including a wide variety of themes such as 
jungles, deserts, busy city streets, ice tracks, 
and gravel-covered hills), nearly a dozen Digimon 
to pick from and unlock, and several gameplay 
modes ranging from cup races to time trials. A 
handful of boss races round out the action, and 
provide a challenge for players. 
 
The twist to this game comes as the racers collect 
energy on the track to digivolve into upgraded 
versions of themselves. Once you've digivolved, 
you can use additional offensive powers to further 
hamper your opponents and keep your own Digimon 
ahead of the others. 
 
While the single-player game will keep you busy 
for a while with its many modes and characters, 
Digimon Racing really shines in the multiplayer 
arena. Since it includes support for up to four 
players using the link cable or wireless adapter, 
the multiplayer experience is the real highlight 
of the game.

Boo has returned to Monstropolis and it is your

version) to get her back home.  However, to make 
things difficult, Randal has destroyed her door. 
 
Avoid Randall and the CDA (Child Detection Agency) 
as well as other dangers as you try getting Boo 
home.  This platform scroller will have you trying 
to find out where you have been as you make your 
way through multiple doorways, up and down 
ladders, and more.  Pick up items along the way as 
you jump and dodge enemies, use your roar attack,

Disney's Aladdin (c) Sep 28, 2004 Capcom Co., Ltd. 
/ Capcom Entertainment, Inc. 
 
Disney's Aladdin is based on the 1992 Disney 
animated film. For the GBA and the SNES editions 
development was handled by Capcom. Like other 
versions, the game is a side-scrolling platformer 
where the player controls Aladdin through 
locations from the movie like the city of Agrabah, 
the Cave of Wonders, and Jafar's palace. Some 
locations not appearing in the film include a 
trippy, candy-colored world inside the Genie's 
lamp and an ancient pyramid. Enemies standing in 
Aladdin's way include the Sultan's guards, animals 
and various magical creatures. They can be 
dispatched by jumping on top of them or by 
throwing apples at them. Besides jumping and 
throwing, another one of Aladdin's abilities 
consists of him pulling out a blanket and using it 
to slow his fall. 
 
Besides the platform levels, the game also 
includes magic carpet rides as well as a bonus 
game played between levels: if Aladdin collects a 
golden scarab in a level, he can play a wheel of 
fortune for extra health, lives or continues.

Jake Long is an average Asian boy from New York, 
with a secret: he is the American Dragon, and can 
transform at will into a powerful dragon to 
protect the magical creatures of America.  
Leprechauns, Unicorns, Mermaids: all of these 
creatures (and more) are real, but living in 
hiding, away from public view.  It's up to the 
American Dragon to protect them from the 
Huntsclan, a band of evildoers who have hunted 
dragonkind and magical creatures for generations. 
 
Rise of the Huntsclan! is a side-scrolling 
beat-em-up starring Jake Long, from the Disney 
cartoon series.  As Jake, players can beat up evil 
doers such as trolls, imps harpies and other 
mischievous creatures out to give Jake a hard 
time.  He can also use his skateboard by holding 
the R Button to travel more quickly.  Jake can 
also build up his "focus meter" by collecting blue 
orbs - when full, he can briefly transform into 
the American Dragon, and destroy his foes with 
powerful fire attacks and flaming breath. 
 
Jake's friends, Fu Dog, Trixie and Spud, and 
Grampa can also be summoned in for their own 
special abilities.  As well as this, Jake can 
select an ability to upgrade at the end of each 
level, such as how long his transformation lasts, 
how powerful his various attacks are, or his 
speed.

Set after the events of the 2002 movie, Disney's 
Lilo & Stitch lets players take control of the two 
lead characters in a variety of action adventure, 
shooter, and puzzle style levels. 
 
Hawaiian life is going well for the newly 
Earth-adjusted Stitch until a group of aliens, led 
by Dr. Pestus, kidnap Lilo and take her to their 
home planet.  Stitch resolves to save her, and 
gameplay shifts between the events of both Lilo 
and Stitch throughout eight levels. 
 
Stitch's levels are all shooter intensive, similar 
to games like Metal Slug for the side-scrolling 
levels, and Gyruss for the shooter levels.  In the 
side scrolling levels, Stitch blasts everything in 
his path with his laser pistols and pineapple 
bombs, until he is eventually able to  find a 
spaceship and continuing his rescue mission to the 
Junkyard Planet. 
 
Lilo's levels are set in an Out of the World or 
Flashback style, where Lilo must use stealth, 
solve puzzles, and use Scrump, her doll, to evade 
and confuse her alien captors. 
 
Once Lilo and Stitch find each other, they must 
escape via an alien tank to stop Dr. Pestus and 
escape back to Earth. 
 
Along the way, players can collect stills and 
small video clips featuring scenes from the movie. 
 The game uses a password save to continue where 
players left off.

Huey, Dewy and Louie went to hide in the attic to 
hide from their uncle Donald's temper when they 
came across a mysterious book.  Upon opening it, 
hand appears and kidnaps the boys into Storybook 
Land.  Now Donald Duck and his pal Mickey Mouse 
must go save the boys by defeating the evil King 
Pete! 
 
This game is for one to two players. You can 
choose to play as either Mickey Mouse or Donald 
Duck.  Options also include difficulty settings. 
 
The gameplay starts off much the way previous 
Magical Quest games have in that you jump on your 
enemies, spin them around, collect coins, etc.  
Later both Mickey and Donald will be given 
costumes that will give them special abilities.  
You will first receive a set of armor.  While 
Mickey receive a full knight's armor which 
includes a lance with a giant boxing glove at the 
end and a shield. Donald, however, gets a barrel 
and a hammer because his butt's too big for the 
armor. Both costumes has its pros and cons - for 
example, Donald's weapon can only be aimed forward 
while Mickey's can be aimed up/down/forward.  But, 
in water Mickey's armor will drag him down and 
sink while Donald's can float.  If playing with 
two players, these attributes can be used together 
so, for example, Mickey can take a ride on 
Donald's back across the water. 
 
In each stage, there are various hidden doors 
which will give you access to Bonus Games, shops 
and areas with coins and treasures. In a Bonus 
Game,  you will pick one of our three cards and 
unless you get the card with King Pete's picture, 
you will receive some sort of prize.  In the 
shops, you can purchase upgrades for your 
costumes, lives and hearts for your health meter.

Classic NES Series - Donkey Kong (c) Nov 11, 2002 
Nintendo Co., Ltd. / Nintendo of America Inc. 
 
Released in the arcades in 1981, Donkey Kong was 
not only Nintendo's first real smash hit for the 
company, but marked the introduction for two of 
their most popular mascots: Mario (originally 
"Jumpman") and Donkey Kong. 
 
Donkey Kong is a platform-action game that has 
Mario scale four different industrial themed 
levels (construction zone, cement factory, an 
elevator-themed level, and removing rivets from 
girders) in an attempt to save the damsel in 
distress, Pauline, from the big ape before the 
timer runs out.  Once the rivets are removed from 
the final level, Donkey Kong falls, and the two 
lovers are reunited.  From there, the levels start 
over at a higher difficulty. 
 
Along the way, Mario must dodge a constant stream 
of barrels, "living" fireballs, and 
spring-weights.  Although not as powerful as in 
other future games, Mario can find a hammer which 
allows him to destroy the barrels and fireballs 
for a limited amount of time.  Additionally, Mario 
can also find Pauline's hat, purse and umbrella 
for additional bonus points. 
 
Donkey Kong is also notable for being one of the 
first complete narratives in video game form, told 
through simplistic cut scenes that advance the 
story.  It should also be noted that in versions 
of the game for early 1980's consoles, Donkey Kong 
only used 2-3 of the original levels, with the 
cement factory usually omitted.

Donkey Kong V3 (c) Apr 21, 2003 Nintendo Co., Ltd. 
/ Nintendo of America Inc. 
 
Released in the arcades in 1983, Donkey Kong 3 is 
the third of the "Donkey Kong" arcade game series, 
changing the format to more of an action-shooter 
than a platform game. 
 
As Stanley the Bugman, players are positioned 
under Donkey Kong, who has taken over a 
multi-level greenhouse.  Stanley's goal is to 
remove Donkey Kong from the greenhouse, but the 
big ape isn't willing to leave without a fight. 
 
Donkey Kong will agitate two beehives that are 
close to him to send down a swarm of angry 
Buzzbees, Beespies and destructive Queen Bees 
toward Stanley.  These insects, as well as 
caterpillars which creep down nearby vines are 
intent on destroying the flowers below Stanley.  
Donkey Kong will also send down projectiles 
himself in an attempt to stop Stanley's attacks.  
Stanley must jump between the levels and use his 
bugspray to repel the insects, and send Donkey 
Kong into the next area of the greenhouse. 
 
Once Stanley pushes Donkey Kong high enough, a can 
of super bugspray will become available, allowing 
a larger shooting radius, and is able to send 
Donkey Kong up the vines faster. 
 
Once Donkey Kong is sent through the three levels 
of the greenhouse, Donkey Kong will end up with a 
beehive on his head, and the levels start all over 
again.

PocketNES V9.98 - Donkey Kong Jr. (c) Sep 16, 2002 
Nintendo Co., Ltd. / Nintendo of America Inc. 
 
Mario has kidnapped Junior's Papa! 
 
Donkey Kong Jr. was originally released in the 
arcades in 1982 as a sequel to Donkey Kong.  In 
this game, Mario plays the antagonist, finally 
having captured Donkey Kong, and has put the ape 
in a locked cage.  As Donkey Kong Jr., players 
will have to make their way through four different 
levels (Vines, Springboard, Chains and Mario's 
Hideout) in an attempt to find keys to free the 
little monkey's Father. 
 
Along the way, Mario will send out Snapjaws, 
swooping purple birds, and electric sparks in an 
attempt to stop Junior.  Junior can defend himself 
by dropping fruit found around the levels on the 
heads of his foes.  The more foes a piece of fruit 
hits in a falling sequence, the higher bonus 
points can be scored. 
 
Junior can also avoid enemies more easily by 
grabbing hold of two chains or vines at a time to 
climb away faster, or by jumping over his foes.  
However, any long fall or falling into the water 
on certain levels will mean the loss of a life for 
Junior. 
 
In the final cut scene, Junior will free Donkey 
Kong and both will escape after giving Mario the 
boot.  Once all four levels are cleared, the game 
levels will start over at a higher difficulty. 
 
Like the original Donkey Kong, the earlier 1980's 
console versions do not have all of the levels and 
animations from the arcade.

DOOM (c) Oct 26, 2001 id Software, Inc. / 
Activision Publishing, Inc. 
 
The Union Aerospace Corporation has been 
experimenting with teleportation technology on 
Mars' moons Phobos and Deimos. After early 
successes, something goes wrong. It seems the 
scientists have opened a gateway straight to Hell. 
Phobos base is overrun with demonic creatures, and 
the whole of Deimos simply vanishes. A squad of 
marines is sent to Phobos, but all except one are 
quickly slaughtered. It falls to the surviving 
marine to grab some guns and strike back at the 
demons. 
 
id Software's follow-up to their genre-defining 
Wolfenstein 3D, DOOM is another first person 
shooter: full-on action seen from the space 
marine's perspective. Like Wolfenstein, the game 
consists of distinct episodes, playable in any 
order. The first episode, Knee-Deep in the Dead, 
takes place in the Phobos base and is freely 
available as shareware. The full game continues on 
Deimos in The Shores of Hell and culminates in 
Inferno, the final episode which takes place in 
Hell itself. Each episode consists of nine levels, 
one of which is a hidden level. 
 
The basic objective in each level is simply to 
reach the exit. Since dozens of enemies stand in 
the way, the only way to get there is through 
killing them. Switches and buttons must be 
pressed to advance at certain points and often 
color-coded locked doors will block the way - 
matching keycards or skull keys must be found to 
pass. 
 
DOOM's engine technology is more advanced than 
Wolfenstein's, and thus the levels are more varied 
and complex. The engine simulates different 
heights (stairs and lifts appear frequently) and 
different lighting conditions (some rooms are 
pitch black, others only barely illuminated). 
There are outdoor areas, pools of radioactive 
waste that hurt the player, ceilings that come 
down and crush him, and unlike Wolfenstein's 
orthogonally aligned corridors, the walls in DOOM 
can be in any angle to each other. An automap 
helps in navigating the levels. 
 
Stylistically, the levels begin with a futuristic 
theme in the military base on Phobos and gradually 
change to a hellish environment, complete with 
satanic symbols (pentagrams, upside-down-crosses 
and portraits of horned demons), hung-up mutilated 
corpses and the distorted faces of the damned. 
 
DOOM features a large weapon arsenal, with most 
weapons having both advantages and drawbacks. The 
starting weapons are the fists and a simple 
pistol. Also available are a shotgun (high damage, 
slow reload, not good at distances), a chaingun 
(high firing rate, but slightly inaccurate in 
longer bursts) and a plasma rifle (combining a 
high firing rate and large damage). The rocket 
launcher also deals out lots of damage, but the 
explosion causes blast damage and must be used 
with care in confined areas or it might prove 
deadly to the player as well as the enemies. Two 
further (in)famous weapons in DOOM are the 
chainsaw for close-quarter carnage, and the 
BFG9000 energy gun, that, while taking some 
practice to fire correctly, can destroy most 
enemies in a single burst. The different weapons 
use four different ammunition types (bullets, 
shells, rockets and energy cells), so collecting 
the right type for a certain gun is important. 
 
DOOM drops some of Wolfenstein's arcade-inspired 
aspects, so there are no extra lives or treasures 
to be collected for points, but many other 
powerups are still available. Medpacks heal damage 
while armor protects from receiving it in the 
first place. Backpacks allow more ammunition to be 
carried, a computer map reveals the whole layout 
of the level on the automap (including any secret 
areas), light amplification visors illuminate dark 
areas and radiation suits allow travel over waste 
without taking damage. Also available are berserk 
packs (which radically increase the damage 
inflicted by the fists) as well as short-time 
invisibility and invulnerability powerups. 
 
The enemies to be destroyed include former humans 
corrupted during the invasion, plus demons in all 
shapes and sizes: fireball-throwing imps, floating 
skulls, pink-skinned demons with powerful bite 
attacks and large one-eyed flying monstrosities 
called Cacodemons. Each episode ends with a boss 
battle against one or two especially powerful 
creatures. 
 
DOOM popularized multiplayer in the genre with two 
different modes: Cooperative allows up to four 
players to move through the single-player game 
together, while Deathmatch is a competitive game 
type where players blast at each other to collect 
'frag' points for a kill and re-spawn in 
a random location after being killed.

DOOM II (c) Oct 23, 2002 id Software, Inc. / 
Activision Publishing, Inc. 
 
In this sequel to the original Doom, you play the 
same hero - the last remaining space marine. After 
having single-handedly saved Mars from demonic 
threat, you return to Earth, only to find out that 
the demons have already invaded it, killed all its 
inhabitants or turned them into demons. It's your 
task to kill all the demons and to save the Earth. 
 
Doom II looks and plays very similarly to its 
predecessor, utilizing the same 3D graphical 
engine with 2D sprites for enemies. The gameplay 
once again consists entirely of navigating the 
hero from first-person view through 3D 
environments and shooting at the demons while 
attempting to find your way out by flipping 
switches and looking for keys. Unlike in Doom, 
which is divided into three episodes, the 30 
levels of Doom II (plus the 2 secret levels) form 
one long episode. 
 
You have the same weapons as in the first Doom, 
plus a new one: a super shotgun. There are also 
some new demons in this sequel, such as the 
chaingun-toting Heavy Weapon Dudes, the skeletal 
Revenants who launch homing missiles and the 
Arch-Viles who have a highly damaging fire attack. 
There is also one new power-up, a Megasphere which 
boosts your health and armor to the max.

colored line as you race against other lines for 
first place.  The idea is to keep your line as 
straight as possible, as you travel fastest in a 
straight line.  But opponents will get in your 
way, causing you to swerve and slow down.  You'll 
also need to dodge obstacles strewn across the 
track. 
 
There are two different game modes initially 
available in Dotstream, with a third mode that is 
unlockable.  The first, 'Campaign', is a Grand 
Prix-like event.  Select your line color and try 
to to come first in each race.  Points are 
allocated based on your position at the end of 
each race.  The line with the most points at the 
end of the campaign is the winner. 
 
The second, 'Spot Race', is a short race around 
any of the tracks that you have previously 
unlocked.  In this mode, you can aim to improve 
your best time.

Dragon Ball: Advanced Adventure follows the 
exploits of young Goku as he sets out for the 
first time to seek the legendary Dragon Balls. 
Based on the earliest manga chapters (before the 
series turned into Dragon Ball Z series), players 
fight their way through platform levels, bashing 
countless goons and bosses inspired by pivotal 
events and characters from the series. 
 
While the game's levels are straightforward 
brawls, special duels and tournament sequences 
play like classic fighting games, albeit with 
simplified controls. Goku can punch, kick and use 
his magic staff. After a certain point in the 
game, getting the Flying Nimbus, he receives the 
ability to engage into air combat. After 
completing the story mode, duel characters become 
available for customizable one-on-one bouts. 
Additional characters and mini-games can be 
unlocked by satisfying special requirements, e.g. 
completing the story mode unlocks Goku's fiend 
Krillin as a playable character.

Dragon Ball Z - Taiketsu (c) Nov 24, 2003 Webfoot 
Technologies, Inc. / Atari, Inc. 
 
Taiketsu is another game adaptation that is based 
on the famous Dragon Ball manga series that were 
written and illustrated by Akira Toriyama. The 
current Dragon Ball game features the following 
options: 
 
1. One Player: Option that allows you to 
   compete as one of the 15 Dragon Ball fighters 
   in the modes available. 
 
1. Tournament: You start with 7 fighters but 
   can unlock more to reach a total of 15. All 
   fighters have the same combos and moves (like 
   block, throws, ki blasts, etc.) and a set of 3 
   unique attacks that do more damage to the 
   opponents. There’s also a combo of buttons that 
   if pressed allows the battle to take place on 
   the air. When on air you can’t use any of your 
   current fighter’s moves but instead you must 
   press rapidly the buttons that appear at the 
   bottom of the screen in order to inflict damage 
   to the opponent. When completing this mode you 
   either get money as a prize or a new character 
   is unlocked. 
2. Endurance: Mode in which you have to fight a 
   set number of opponents with only one life bar. 
3. Time Challenge: Just like Tournament mode 
   you fight a number of opponents with the 
   exception that here you must do the least 
   possible time. Again just like the Tournament 
   mode if you complete the Time Challenge you 
   either get money as a prize or unlock a new 
   character. 
4. Sparring: Here you can select any of the 
   fighters and practice their moves. 
5. Endurance 2x: Same as Endurance mode apart 
   from the number of opponents which is doubled 
   this time. The current mode is unlocked via the 
   Z-Store. 
 
Multiplayer: By teaming up with another player via 
the link cable you can fight two opponents 
controlled by the CPU. 
 
Z-Store: The place where you can spent the money 
  you have earned to buy images, character bios, 
  bonus settings (make both fighters invisible, 
  one hit instant death and others), etc.

Dragon Quest Monsters Caravan Heart (c) Mar 29, 
2003 Tose Co., Ltd. / Enix Corporation 
 
Following in the footsteps of the media phenomenon 
Pokémon, Dragon Quest Monsters lets players travel 
a fantasy world on a quest to capture monsters and 
train them in battles against other creatures. An 
aspect integral to the Monsters series from the 
start is the breeding or merging of monsters to 
create stronger offspring inheriting the parents' 
skill sets. 
 
Only released in Japan, Dragon Quest Monsters: 
Caravan Heart puts players once again in the role 
of prince Kiefer from Dragon Quest / Dragon 
Warrior VII. Like previous Dragon Quest Monsters 
games for the GameBoy Color whose plot took place 
before Dragon Quest VI, Caravan Heart is set 
before the events of the main series' part from 
which it was spun off. 
 
Hiding from the consequences of one of his 
infamous pranks again, young Kiefer is whisked 
away by the goddess Rubiss, known from Dragon 
Quest II and III, to the land of Alefgard. There 
he meets the boy Lewin whose parents have fallen 
ill. To cure them with the 'Ball of Roto' artefact 
and secure his passage home, Kiefer takes the lead 
of a monster caravan travelling through the 
country. 
 
The monster caravan, made up of the Dragon Quest 
series' iconic covered wagons, acts as players' 
mobile base from which they plan their monster 
hunts. Travelling with it consumes food rations, 
one of the game's resources. 
Unlike in the first Dragon Quest games, Kiefer can 
recruit monsters as well as human protagonists 
into his party which can take on various jobs. The 
monster breeding from previous titles was replaced 
by merging monsters, requiring the game's other 
resource, monster hearts.

Drowzee loves to eat dreams and unfortunately the 
only things about are belligerent primeapes that 
don't take kindly to having their dreams served up 
as food. 
 
As Drowzee you'll need to hypnotize your mark 
before you can eat it's dream. You'll do this by 
moving to the primeape's left or right at sending 
soporific mental waves into the back of it's head. 
Waves are cast with a and movement is done wit the 
d-pad. If the primeape spots you it will punch you 
right out of the screen so be careful to be on the 
side it's not looking at. 
 
After you put the primeape to sleep you'll 
automatically feast on it's dream, gain a point, 
and then move onto the next monkey. The primeapes 
get swifter for each dream you've eaten. 
 
The game can be accessed by scanning the long 
dot-code on the Pokemon-e Aquapolis cards Drowzee

Dungeons and Dragons - Eye of the Beholder (c) Nov 
07, 2002 Pronto Games, Inc. / Infogrames, Inc. 
 
Dungeons & Dragons: Eye of the Beholder is a 
classic dungeon crawler that challenges the player 
to lead a party of adventurers on a quest for fame 
and fortune in a world based on Forgotten Realms, 
a Dungeons & Dragons universe. 
 
The party will scour the dark underbelly of 
Waterdeep for an evil source of power that 
threatens the streets above. Nary an hero would 
dare step into these dungeons alone, so the player 
must create a party of up to six adventurers from 
four base classes (Wizard, Rogue, Cleric and 
Fighter) and seven races (Human, Half-Elf, 
Half-Orc, Moon Elf, Lightfoot Halfling, Rock Gnome 
and Shield Dwarf). All are based on character 
types from the Dungeons & Dragons 3rd Edition 
license. 
 
The first-person view draws the player into the 
role of adventurer. A handy auto-map feature helps 
to navigate the complex mazes of slime-covered 
walls and hidden passages. For the turn-based 
battles, the view switches to an isometric 
overhead perspective. Each character can be 
assigned commands for moving, attacking and 
spell-casting. Characters can also learn over 100 
unique skills, feats, and spells that are straight 
out of the Dungeons and Dragons 3rd Edition rules. 
 
As with all RPGs, success depends on constantly 
upgrading equipment, assigning new spells and 
reordering the group. Over 100 items, both magical 
and ordinary will keep the player adventuring for 
hours.

Dynasty Warriors Advance (c) Aug 29, 2005 KOEI 
Co., Ltd. / Nintendo of America Inc. 
 
Dynasty Warriors Advance is a Game Boy Advance 
adaptation of the Dynasty Warriors franchise. 
Based on the "Three Kingdoms period" of ancient 
China,  it takes place at the end of the Han 
Dynasty during 190 A.D. As the previous government 
collapses, warlords rise up and fight among one 
another, eventually establishing three powerful 
kingdoms: Wei, Wu and Shu. Generals from each of 
these nations spend the next 100 years fighting 
among one another, each trying to become the 
dominant power. 
 
Dynasty Warriors Advance is a top-down turn-based 
strategy board game, but with a focus on action 
combat. Since it is based on the earlier Dynasty 
Warriors titles, many of the same concepts carry 
over. Players begin by choosing one of three 
available characters from the lands of either Wu, 
Shu or Wei. Each character has their own unique 
storyline and missions. A briefing is given for 
each mission detailing specific objectives before 
allowing the player to equip themselves with 
weapons and skills at the camp. Once begun, the 
player moves the designed number of spaces 
(determined by movement) around the "board". If an 
enemy player is encountered, the game shifts to a 
top-down action fighting mode. Here the player 
uses one button to attack, another button to 
charge and another to unleash a misou special 
attack once it is powered up. Misou energy is 
charged by successful attacking enemy units. The 
player's success against the enemy unit will 
determine the unit's "heath" and will be destroyed 
completely if all of it's units are destroyed. 
Some enemy units contain not just soldiers but 
enemy generals who have their own special moves 
and greater health. Many missions feature specific 
objectives rather than just defeating all enemies.

Earthworm Jim 2 (c) May 30, 2002 
 
An ordinary average earthworm named Jim goes about 
his normal daily life, cruising around avoiding 
crows and doing other general worm-like things. 
Jim is suddenly struck by a very large ultra- 
high- tech- indestructible- super- space- cyber- 
suit. Through sheer luck, Jim rests safely in the 
neck ring of the suit. 
 
Suddenly, the ultra-high-tech space particles of 
the suit begin interacting with Jim's soft wormy 
flesh. A radical light-speed evolution takes 
place. 
 
Jim soon realizes he is in control of the suit. 
 
Gameplay is similar to the first game, with Jim 
jumping and running through the levels. There are 
5 weapons more than the original game to collect. 
Characters like Princess Whats-Her-Name and 
Psy-Crow appear.

Ecks vs. Sever (c) Nov 08, 2001 Crawfish 
Interactive Ltd. / BAM! Entertainment, Inc. 
 
Ecks vs. Sever is the amongst the first FPSes to 
be featured on the Game Boy Advance. The game 
tells the story of Ecks, an ex-FBI Agent whose 
orders are to hunt down the beautiful assassin 
named Sever. As the cat-and-mouse-hunt progresses, 
both agents will find out that they are mere pawns 
in a larger government conspiracy... 
 
In the Single Player mode, the player can choose 
wether he wants to play as Ecks or Sever. The 
choice makes a radical difference in the 
single-player campaign. As Ecks, your orders are 
to chase Sever, whilst as Sever, you have to evade 
him. The levels for both characters tend to be the 
same, but with different objectives, and different 
locations for both characters. 
 
As an example, the orders of Sever are to hunt 
down and kill a government agent whilst as Ecks, 
your orders are to prevent the assassination. 
During this level, both characters will encounter 
each other. As Ecks, you'll have to try and snipe 
Sever whilst evading her grenades. When you play 
this level as Sever, you'll have to throw grenades 
at Ecks, whilst avoiding his sniper fire. 
 
The game also has a multi-player mode for up to 4 
players with three different modes, which are 
Deathmatch (Every man for himself), Assassination 
(one player is the assassin who has to hunt down 
the VIP who's being protected by bodyguards) and 
Bomb kit (Try to gather all parts of a bomb before 
the other players do).

Elevator Action - Old & New (c) Dec 19, 2002 
MediaKite / Taito Corporation 
 
A re-release of the original Elevator Action (the 
"old") with an additional arranged version created 
specifically for the GBA (the "new"). 
 
Elevator Action casts you as a super-spy with the 
mission to collect secret documents from an enemy 
building and escape unharmed. Played from a 
non-scrolling side view, you have to direct your 
agent to each office in order to collect the 
documents while avoiding enemy guards and their 
weapons. You can navigate from floor to floor by 
controlling the many elevators that fill the 
building, as well as shoot your enemies or light 
fixtures in each floor to give you an edge while 
your enemies stumble in the dark. 
 
The new arranged version features remade cute-fied 
graphics, multiple selectable characters (each 
with different abilities and attacks), a health 
bar, and expanded levels with more challenges and 
new enemies such as robots and zombies. But 
otherwise plays just like the original.

Elf - The Movie (c) Nov 04, 2004 Human Soft Inc. / 
Crave Entertainment, Inc. 
 
This platformer is based on the hit 2003 movie 
starring Will Ferrell who played a boy who was 
raised by elves in the North Pole and became a 
large elf comparatively. At 30 years of age, Buddy 
goes on a journey to New York to find his real 
father and a place where he can fit in.  The 
game's release was timed to come out the following 
2004 holiday season with the dvd release and 
contains the choice of 5 languages. 
 
The main game is a side-scroller where you guide 
Buddy as he makes his way across icebergs while 
avoiding chasms and polar bears, dodges Manhattan 
traffic, and more. There are 10 missions based on 
the movie's events as he journeys to also help 
Santa and save Christmas.  You must collect 
missing sleigh parts, letters (to spell "New York" 
in one level) or parcels.  You will be penalized 
falling into the icy water or getting hit by a car 
which drains your health. To restore it, you   
jump for lollipops and candies, Buddy's favorite 
foods. There are also 3 mini-games available from 
the start menu: Snowman Building is like Sokoban, 
Santa Says is a memorization game, and Cobbler's 
Workshop has you matching elves' shoes to put them 
in boxes. Plus, more minigames are available 
within the game.

Eragon (c) Nov 17, 2006 Amaze Entertainment, Inc. 
/ Sierra Entertainment, Inc. 
 
Eragon for the Game Boy Advance is a traditional 
turn based RPG with a combat system that 
emphasizes motion and action.  Players use 
combinations of spells, melee attacks, and ranged 
attacks to battle Urgals, thieves, soldiers, and 
other various enemies.  This is an RPG where 
combat strategy plays a key role in success. 
 
Players can make use of the RPG mechanics to 
create offensive and defensive potions, craft 
better armor and weapons, learn offensive and 
defensive spells, or become trackers who are able 
to find hidden encounters.  This design encourages 
experimentation, opens up a lot of strategic 
possibilities, and allows a lot of replayability. 
 
The player assumes the role of Eragon, a young boy 
with a mysterious origin and an important future, 
on his perilous journey to avenge his father, 
rescue the woman of his dreams and join forces 
with the Varden in their war against King 
Galbatorix. On this adventure Eragon encounters 
many allies

differences with this American version. 
 
One difference is the branding of ESPN on the

giving the game the look of an ESPN television 
broadcast.  Also, whereas the Japanese version 
featured characters that were geared towards anime 
and had larger heads, this version's characters 
are more realistically designed to look like 
actual people instead.  It also features the 
ability to allow four friends to play against each

One of the Game Boy Advance's launch titles from 
Majesco (alongside Boxing Fever and Iridion 3D), 
F-14 Tomcat is essentially a port of Absolute 
Entertainment's 1994 SNES game Turn and Burn: 
No-Fly Zone. The game content is exactly the same, 
but it features a multiplayer mode between other 
systems (if they have a copy of the game and the 
GBA Link Cable, of course) and a brand new 
storyline: the player controls a F-14 pilot chosen 
by the US government to be assigned in the theater 
of operations of a war between the republics of 
China and Taiwan to protect America's "interests" 
in the region. 
 
The game includes, apart from the previously 
mentioned multiplayer mode, a landing practice 
mode, like Turn and Burn. It was later implemented 
in Majesco's two following GBA flight sims, 2004's 
Super Hornet F/A-18F and 2007's F24 Stealth 
Fighter, which re-used this game's engine, with 
the option of selecting between a landing carrier 
or a landing strip.

As a young detective (whom you name yourself), you 
work as an assistant for the famous investigator 
Utsugi. Your first important assignment is to 
investigate a murder case. A girl named Yoko was 
found murdered near a central bridge. During the 
investigation, you discover a strange rumor about 
a mysterious ghost-like "girl who stands at the 
back", spread around the school Yoko studied at. 
Soon the young detective realizes that the case 
grows more and more complex and that he will need 
all his wit and talents to find the criminal! 
 
This adventure game is dedicated entirely to 
investigation. You have a menu with various 
choices (Talk, Investigate, Think), as well as 
multiple topics to ask the suspects about. You 
should find clues by questioning people and 
gathering information, but also by examining areas 
- in certain places you should move a hand-like 
cursor over the screen and click on a precise spot 
to examine it.

FIFA Football 2003 (c) Nov 12, 2002 Exient 
Entertainment / Electronic Arts, Inc. 
 
FIFA 2003 continues the trend of improving each 
year's new release by keeping the formula that 
worked, while also adding new features to make the 
game more enjoyable. 
 
Some of these new features including a "Freestyle" 
control, which is activated by the right 
thumbstick, causing you to do special moves, such 
as a deke, or kick the ball a fair length forwards 
to gain some speed. 
 
New and improved "dead ball" control makes corner 
kicks, free kicks, etc. more controllable and 
gives you more options.  The passing game has been 
improved as to allow better passing by kicking 
directly to a teammate, passing to nowhere in 
particular, or open passing to allow anybody to 
take it. 
 
FIFA 2003 includes all FIFA clubs, leagues, and 
players.

FIFA Football 2004 (c) Nov 04, 2003 EA 
Canada|Exient Entertainment / Electronic Arts,

FIFA Soccer 2004 features eighteen leagues, with 
thirty-five national teams and over ten thousand 
players. Take them into a multi-season career, or 
individual tournaments or matches. 
 
Like EA's other 2004 games it has an in depth 
career mode, where you must manage your budget and 
team.  Promote players, demote players and 
renegotiate contracts, all in an effort to get 
your team to the finals again and again. 
 
The skills to master range from kicked passes and 
headers to lob passes and bicycle kicks. You can 
take control of players before the ball reaches 
them, which makes it easier to find space to take 
the ball. Like other 2004 titles, FIFA uses the 
right analog stick for it's Freestyle gameplay. 
 
Console versions use the EA Sports Bio, whereby 
you can continue to improve your gamer level and 
unlock rewards by playing other 2004 titles, such 
as Madden NFL 2004 or NBA Live 2004.

FIFA Football 2005 (c) Oct 12, 2004 Electronic 
Arts Canada|Exient Entertainment / Electronic 
Arts, Inc. 
 
Released only a few months after Euro 2004, FIFA 
2005 brings several features to the franchise, 
such as the return of a player creation tool, 
where a player can be created from scratch from 
customizing the face (while it's not possible to 
define the texture like in previous EA Sports 
games such as NHL 2000, the player can customize 
the facial features such as shape of the eyes or 
the cheeks, in a way similar to RPGs such as 
Neverwinter Nights), accessories and playing 
abilities. It's also possible to create all kinds 
of competitions. 
The Career mode was also extended, allowing now up 
to 15 seasons, and giving the player the chance to 
turn the tide of a simulated match anytime. This 
mode is a "light" managerial mode, where the 
player not only plays, but also signs new players 
and increase the clubs abilities in trainers, 
medical staff and other club staff). 
 
The main gameplay change was the addition of 
"First Touch" controls. By performing one of the 
"trick" moves before the player gets possession of 
the ball it's possible to do a number of moves, 
such as touching the ball forward to gain a few 
yards ahead of the defenders or touch the ball to 
one side, and roll to the other of a rushing 
defender, and then pickup up the ball a bit ahead 
leaving the opponent stranded, and the inclusion 
of a fake shot move, which allows forwards to sit 
a goalkeeper before scoring in style or make 
defenders jump from their positions, opening room 
for a through pass or a run into goal. Other 
aspects of the game, such as the "Off The Ball" 
controls (allows the control of players that 
aren't in possession, moving them into an open 
position) remain unchanged. 
 
Another new feature is the FIFA Shop, where the 
player can trade points earned in many ways, from 
simple tasks like having a peek at the Jukebox to 
obtaining 10 victories in a row in Career mode, 
for several items, such as third jerseys, 
additional music, more balls and night stadiums. 
 
As it became the norm with the series, the game 
features 18 leagues and 38 national teams (some of 
these, due to licensing problems feature only 
generic kits and logos), summing up around 11'000 
real footballers.

Final Fantasy II (c) Dec 12, 2005 Square Co., Ltd. 
/ Nintendo of America Inc. 
 
This is the fourth entry in the  Final Fantasy 
series. It was known as Final Fantasy II 
internationally, because the  second and third 
games were never released outside of Japan. 
 
The military country of Baron is one of the 
strongest in the land, with a proud army and a 
majestic air force known as the Red Wings. But, 
while their armies are kind and loyal, the recent 
actions of the King are anything but. The young 
Captain of the Red Wings, Cecil, is ordered to 
steal a crystal from a village of innocent 
magicians, and when he questions the actions of 
his King, Cecil is immediately thrown out of the 
country and sent off to kill strange monsters. 
Little does he realize the price the King's 
actions will pay, and what the true secret of the 
crystals, and their powers, truly is... 
 
This is the first Final Fantasy game that 
introduced the famous ATB (active-time battle) 
system: during the battles, you have a time 
indicator for each party member that tells you 
when this character is able to act. If it takes 
you too long to select a command for this 
character, the enemy will act without waiting for 
your turn. The game abandons the job system that 
was implemented in the  first and the  third game 
in favor of pre-set character classes (paladin, 
white mage, ninja, etc.) assigned to each party 
member. 
 
The PlayStation version adds a new rendered intro 
and ending.

Final Fantasy III (c) Feb 05, 2007 Square Enix 
Co., Ltd. / Nintendo of America Inc. 
 
This is the sixth entry in the  Final Fantasy 
series. It was called Final Fantasy III because 
three of the five previous installments of the 
series were never released outside of Japan. 
 
1,000 years ago, the War of the Magi occurred. 
People remember it as one of the most horrible 
tragedies in history. Since the War of the Magi, 
magic has been all but forgotten, technology began 
to grow, and people returned to seemingly normal 
lives. The only true worry people had was the 
Empire, whose leaders were looking to revive the 
great force once known as "magic". 
 
But then...something happened that would change 
the course of history forever... 
 
The Empire had heard word of the remains of a 
mystical being, known as an "Esper", being found 
in the mining town of Narshe. Quickly, three 
soldiers were dispatched to find this Esper and 
bring it to the Emperor. One of the soldiers, a 
young girl, triggers a power in the Esper that 
will begin one of the most dangerous series of 
events ever. And the only ones who can help her 
are a rag-tag band of rebels and heroes, whose 
very hearts and souls are the only ones that can 
save the world from the mad plans of the Empire. 
 
The game maintains the ATB (active time battle) 
system of the two previous  Final Fantasy games, 
spicing classic turn-based combat engine with a 
real-time element. The customization system 
combines character-specific classes with 
free-flowing character development. By finding 
various Espers and equipping them on characters, 
you can improve their parameters in different ways 
and choose the magic spells you want to learn for 
each character.

Final Fantasy I & II - Dawn of Souls (c) Nov 29, 
2004 Square Enix Co., Ltd. / Nintendo of America 
Inc. 
 
The two titles that began the Final Fantasy 
Adventure return in an updated and improved 
portable form. Both titles feature updated visuals 
from their original NES origins and an improved 
translation of the story, filling in certain plot 
holes previously untold in other re-releases.  
Both games have also been rebalanced to require 
less "grinding," and feature gameplay fixes such 
as party members re-targeting a new enemy if the 
one they currently are targeting dies.  Players 
are also able to save at any point outside of 
combat (including dungeons) and return upon 
loading. 
 
As with other Final Fantasy titles, players take 
on the role of a group of four heroes out to save 
the world. Using a vast collection of spells, 
weapons, and potions, players will travel across 
the kingdom fighting a range of evil characters 
and gaining experience to increase strength and 
magic abilities. Final Fantasy I allows players to 
build their party out of six possible classes, 
with varying spells and stats.  Final Fantasy II 
brings more characterization to the party members, 
and builds their stats exclusively by constant use 
in battle. 
 
Both games get additional content in this version. 
 Final Fantasy I features four "Soul of Chaos" 
dungeons, unlocked during the course of the plot.  
These elemental dungeons are for high-level 
players, and feature a collection of bosses taken 
from later Final Fantasy games.  Final Fantasy II 
features an extra storyline known as the "Soul of 
Rebirth."  This mode is unlocked after completing 
the game and acts as an epilogue, featuring 
characters killed off in the main story.  Both 
games gain a Bestiary that tracks all the monsters 
the player has fought and their stats and 
weaknesses.

Final Fantasy Tactics Advance (c) Sep 08, 2003 
Square Enix Co., Ltd. / Nintendo of America Inc. 
 
Marche and a few friends are out on a usual 
venture through their local town, St. Ivalice, 
only to discover a book filled with fantasy and 
magic. Setting their mind to the thoughts of a 
magical land, they get transported to the world of 
Ivalice, which happens to be based on one of the 
friends' favourite games, Final Fantasy. 
 
Finding himself alone, Marche must join a clan of 
warriors and travel through this new land of 
mystery to find his lost friends, and return to 
the real world, while learning all about this new 
place and the magic it holds. 
 
Not a direct sequel to Final Fantasy Tactics, FFTA 
combines the many elements of the tactical 
original with a slightly modern feel, and an 
original storyline for the GBA. As a clan leader, 
you must manage your team (from their combat 
skills and inventory to each and every battle you 
face). 
 
Both your basic handheld weapons and magic are 
available to you, with the ability to summon 
monsters for support. Two players can link GBA's 
for battles, trading items and clan members as 
well.

The Elemental Crystals...the life source of the 
planet. With them, gentle winds blow, the seas are 
active, fire burns bright, and the earth is full 
of life. All seems well in the world, until the 
wind suddenly stops, the sea begin to grow 
stagnant, the heat of fire becomes scarce, and the 
earth begins to wither. King Tycoon, sensing a 
premonition of evil, hurries off to check on the 
Wind Crystal, only to witness it destroy itself. 
 
Meanwhile, a young traveler named Butz is camping 
in a field when a giant meteor strikes the planet. 
When he heads out to examine the meteor, he is 
shocked to find a young girl named Lenna, who is 
the princess of Tycoon, and a old man named Galuf, 
who is on a critical mission. Later, joined by 
Faris, a pirate captain, the foursome must travel 
the land in search of the destructor of the 
Crystals, and save the planet at any cost! 
 
Final Fantasy V featured many new gameplay options 
and tactics, including an improved Job/Ability 
system (like in Final Fantasy Tactics), the return 
of the ATB (Active Time Battle) turn system, and 
all of the classic FF gameplay you've come to know 
and love! 
 
Final Fantasy V was released as a stand-alone game 
in Japan, and again in Final Fantasy Collection. 
Its U.S. debut was as part of Final Fantasy 
Anthology. It was also later ported to the Gameboy 
Advance, adding 4 new Jobs, a new 30-floor 
dungeon, a bestiary, a music player, the ability 
to quick save anywhere, a few extra pieces of 
equipment, and a newly update translation.

Fire Emblem - The Sacred Stones (c) May 23, 2005 
Intelligent Systems Co., Ltd. / Nintendo of 
America Inc. 
 
Eight hundred years ago, the sacred stones were 
used to defeat the Demon King. Sealing his soul 
inside the stones, peace was brought to the 
continent of Magvel and five nations were built 
around the power of the sacred stones. 
 
However, after 800 years of peace, the Grado 
Empire suddenly attacks his longtime ally Renais 
and a larger war threatens to break out. The 
player takes on the role of Prince Ephraim and his 
sister Princess Erika, two of the few survivors of 
Grado's attack, following their different paths 
through the story. 
 
Gameplay in Fire Emblem: The Sacred Stones is 
similar to its predecessors or the Advance Wars 
games. The player controls several different units 
in tactical turn-based battles. 
 
There are many different classes ranging from 
knights, thieves and archers to paladins, wyvern 
riders, great knights and more. As in RPGs, units 
receive experience points for their actions and 
may choose to upgrade to a different class once 
they reach a high enough level. 
 
A key element in Fire Emblem's gameplay are the 
three different types of weapons and magic. One 
type of weapon or magic is always strong against 
one, and weak against another type. 
 
During battles, it is also possible to visit 
stores to buy equipment, or houses to gain hints. 
 
Sometimes neutral units will also participate in 
battle. They can be convinced to join the player's 
army if the right person talks to them. 
 
Unlike most similar games, when a unit dies in 
battle it is impossible to revive it.

In fire hoops your goal is to set 100 hoops on 
fire by leaping through them as the flaming horse 
Rapidash. The game starts with Rapidash running 
across a field when a golden bird, Ho-oh, flies 
ahead of him. Rapidash gives chase. 
 
Rapidash stays on the left side of the screen 
while rushing towards the hoops. Pressing up on 
the d-pad will initiate a jump, how long you hold 
the direction will dictate how high the jump is. 
One missed hoop and the game resets. 
 
The game can be accessed by scanning the long 
dot-code on the Pokemon-e Expedition cards, 
Rapidash (51) - version 1/2 and Ho-oh (52) - 
version 1/2. Version 1 was included with the

Fire Pro Wrestling has a stacked roster, comprised 
of many not-quite-copyright-infringing wrestlers 
like "The Bionic Man" Steve Majors ("Stone Cold" 
Steve Austin) and Axe Duggan (Hulk Hogan), making 
WCW vs. WWF vs. ECW matches possible.  The 
controls are much more than the typical "mash 
buttons until something happens" that were so 
popular in earlier wrestling games, instead 
relying on timing to properly execute a move or 
hold.

In this second version of the Fire Pro series in

usual CAW mode allowing to increase that number by 
77. Along the Practice Dojo and the Exhibition 
match, the main mode is the Ironman road, where 
the initial roster of 10 wrestlers (11 once you 
finish training mode) is expanded as you beat your 
opponents one by one. Both Exhibition and Ironman 
Road feature match kinds such as Gruesome and 
Deathmatch (inside a electrified cage) with all 
assorted rule changes included. There's also the 
ability to play in a four-man Battle Royal. 
 
The CAW mode, one of the selling points of the 
original SNES titles, is as good as ever, allowing 
to create Wrestlers from scratch, personalizing 
them from how they look to how they fight, as well 
as trading them between federations.

Follow Hoothoot (c) May 05, 2003 Nintendo Co., 
Ltd. / Wizards of the Coast, Inc. 
 
In this game a young Hoothoot, one legged owl, 
will learn to dance from his hoary Hoothoot dance 
instructor. The instructor believes the best 
method is for you to copy exactly what does, get 
it wrong to many times and he'll storm off, class 
over. 
 
You'll have to mimic the moves of the professor 
using the directional pad and the A and B buttons 
to perform special moves. Dance your way to the 
highest score you can! 
 
The game can be accessed by scanning the long 
dot-code on the Pokémon-e Skyridge cards Hoot-Hoot 
(65/144),  Sunflora (105/144), Venonat (112/144), 
Weedle (114/144). Or in Japan, the Pokemon e-card 
expansion 5 cards Hoot-Hoot (63/88),  Sunflora

Ford Racing 3 (c) Nov, 2005 Razorworks|Visual 
Impact / Destination Software, Inc. 
 
The handheld versions of Ford Racing 3 allow 
players to race in a number of Ford-licensed cars, 
from classics (Model T) to new models (2005 
Mustang GT), cars from movies, off-road tracks and 
even concepts vehicles such as the Mustang GT-R 
Concept. 
 
From the main driver profile where all statistics 
are recorded, players can do a quick race of one 
of the three competitions: Ford Competition, Ford 
Challenge and Ford Collection. Most of the game's 
features need to be unlocked first. Next to the 
regular racing controls there is also a button 
used for boost. The different competitions offer 
ten racing types: 
 
1. Standard: race for the first place. 
 
2. Elimination: race five opponents over three 
   laps. After the first and the second lap, the 
   last two cars are knocked out and a duel ensues 
   in the final lap. 
 
3. Duel: a 3-lap race against six challengers 
   in succession. After each won lap, a new one 
   starts. 
 
4. Drafting: stay in the opponent's slipstream 
   to raise a power bar. 
 
5. Driving Skills: race against the time and 
   keep the timer going by passing through gates 
   that award time bonuses. 
 
6. Seconds Out: race against the time while 
   collecting bonuses. 
 
7. Time Attack: a straightforward timed race. 
 
8. Boost: race with two boosts per lap. 
 
9. Relay: transfer a baton three times around 
   the track. 
 
10. Overtake: overtake a number of vehicles 
    before time runs out.

Fortress (c) Aug, 2001 Pipedream Interactive, Inc. 
/ Majesco Sales, Inc. 
 
Fortress is a Tetris-variant puzzle game. As in 
that classic game, geometric pieces fall from the 
top of the screen and must be arranged in lines. 
Only instead of eliminating lines, the objective 
this time is to add them to the screen. The game 
starts with a timer (that counts a moment where 
neither player attack) and a castle gate falling 
between two flags (the opponent's flags can be 
seen to the left of the screen). Once placed, the 
remaining pieces are used to build a castle around 
it, as every 2x3 grid of pieces transforms into 
its walls. A grid of 8x3 pieces transforms into a 
wizard's tower that can summon a creature to 
attack the enemy castle. 
 
Certain special blocks add features to the 
building: a cannon block places a shooting cannon 
that starts to attack automatically the opponent's 
fortress. A block with a window adds one to the 
building. Repairing peons come out of it to help 
fix the damage to the castle's walls. A block with 
a bomb adds a cannon that fires a peon towards the 
opponent's castle (an aiming reticule is shown 
over the enemy castle to help choose the right 
spot). Building walls around these special blocks 
prevent their destruction from the enemy attack. A 
monster appears randomly at the bottom of the 
screen to attack both players. 
 
The player's goal at each level is to reach a 
number of score points before the opponent. The 
pieces can be maneuvered with the digital pad, and 
pressing UP on it makes them fall fast downwards. 
They can be rotated clockwise and anti-clockwise 
with the A and B buttons, respectively. Holding 
the R trigger allows the player to move the screen 
with the digital pad (for a full view of battle 
scene). When pressed, the L trigger destroys the 
top 3 rows of your castle and decreases the score. 
 
The game has three game modes: tournament, battle 
and blitz. They vary in the amount of seconds on 
the timer and the goal score. There are four 
themes: pre-historic, medieval, pirate and space.

challenges and complete mission objectives. The 
action takes place in and around Foster's Home for 
Imaginary Friends and features many of the

level is to avoid all the monsters you will find 
as well as avoid the many dangerous obstacles. 
 
The game includes both land and underwater levels 
for a total of 16 levels in 4 worlds, with over 20 
different enemies to face.  There are also bonus 
levels that can be found. 
 
As your work your way through the levels, Frogger 
will gain various special abilities such as being 
able to float or jump to really high areas.  These 
abilities allow Frogger to get through the more 
difficult levels.

The Eternity Wand has been broken and Hocus has 
come to ask Frogger to find the 5 Magic Shards to 
repair the wand.  Frogger, always enjoying 
adventure, heads off to different islands to find 
the shards. 
 
On your journey, you can pick up extra lives and 
can open bonus levels.  There are classic Frogger 
areas (such as jumping across logs on a river) and 
new types of areas for Frogger to travel. 
 
Work your way through the islands to find the five 
shards without falling or getting squashed.  
Unless you can find the five shards to restore the 
wand, magic will become wild.  You see an example 
of what is in store for the world in the 
introduction as your TV remote suddenly pops 
flowers out of it when you try to use it.

Garfield has lost his Pooky bear and its your job 
to help find Pooky by controlling Garfield in his 
search. The search for Pooky will take Garfield 
through his most known locales, he will meet the 
other characters (like Jon, Odie, Arlene, etc.), 
and of course encounter typical Garfield elements 
like spiders, food, mice, dogs, etc. 
 
During his search Garfield will inevitably eat 
food and lots of it of course. In the game food 
will also represent energy. The more food Garfield 
eats, the more energy he has to do extraordinary 
moves. A level plays like a sideway scrolling 
platform game, though some levels will also scroll 
up and down to span a larger vertical area. 
Garfield moves from one side of the screen towards 
the other and must pick up food and other goodies 
on the way. At the same time all sorts of 
obstacles will have to be avoided, such as web 
spinning spiders, happy Odie rushing towards 
Garfield, bad food, annoying kids, angry 
pit-bulls, and more.

Gauntlet - Dark Legacy (c) Nov 20, 2002 Pocket 
Studios / Midway Games, Inc. 
 
A port of the arcade game, Gauntlet: Dark Legacy 
is the follow-up to Gauntlet: Legends and another 
installment in the long-running Gauntlet series of 
hack-and-slash action games. As with all the 
Gauntlet games, you play a medieval fantasy 
character who, along with allies if you have them, 
fights his or her way through hordes of evil 
creatures on the never ending quest for more gold 
and perhaps even an eventual goal. 
 
This version contains the characters and levels 
from Gauntlet: Legends, plus the new characters 
and levels from the Dark Legacy arcade game, with 
a few extra levels thrown in. 
 
There are eight characters to initially choose 
from: the mighty Warrior, the deadly Valkyrie, the 
quick-footed Archer, the powerful Wizard, the 
spellcasting Sorceress, the stalwart Knight, the 
valiant Dwarf, and the chaotic Jester. Although 
there are similarities between characters from the 
two games, each character looks and plays 
differently. In addition, there are eight 
alternative-modes for these characters to unlock, 
plus dozens of secret characters to obtain. With a 
multi-tap, up to four players can play, with rules 
governing how much they can hurt each other. 
Unlike the original Gauntlets, the levels you'll 
face take place in various terrain from forests to 
mountains to volcanic plains. Many of the monsters 
are familiar to old fans of the series, but there 
are some new blood among the ranks of evil, 
including some rather large foes. 
 
Unlike the early Gauntlet arcade games, the camera 
angle varies from location to location, from 
bird's eye to nearly ground level. The lands, 
creatures, and heroes are all rendered in 3D. 
While the graphics have been upgraded, the game 
play is very similar. You basically run around 
levels, hacking at what seems like unlimited 
armies of monsters, searching for gold, keys, and 
health-giving food...as well as a way out of the 
level. Bosses and other scripted events slow down 
the repetitious nature of the originals. 
 
While levels can be gained and characters saved, 
Gauntlet: Dark Legacy is an action game with some 
RPG trappings and should not be confused with the 
more true types from that genre.

Gensou Suikoden Card Stories (c) Sep 13, 2001 
Konami Corporation / Konami Corporation 
 
Set in Suikoden universe, the game follows closely 
the story of  Suikoden II. The hero is a young 
member of the Unicorn Brigade of the Highland 
Army. One night, your camp is attacked. You and 
your best friend Jowy escape, and the fate takes 
you into different directions, when you get 
involved in a war between several nations. 
 
Unlike "mainstream" Suikoden games, this is a card 
RPG. Most of the game is spent playing a special 
card game with your opponents. The complex card 
game is not unlike a strategy battle: you have 
three types of cards, some of which take you to a 
specific "mission" (you open the game with such 
cards), while others represent various characters 
with different strengths and weaknesses. You can 
acquire cards in shops, get them from your 
opponents, and also look for them in randomly 
generated dungeons.

Rider, although going against Mephisto's will, 
agrees to stop this plan only to save the woman he 
loves, Roxanne Simpson. 
 
The player as The Ghost Rider must stop this plan 
by battling many demons on Earth while on foot 
with upgradeable attacks done with fists and the 
Hell chain. The player must also race across miles 
of land on the Hell Cycle killing the demons on 
their various transportation ways with the hell 
chain and fireballs.

Goemon New Age Shutsudou! (c) Feb 28, 2002 Konami 
Corporation / Konami Corporation 
 
A sequel of sorts of Ganbare Goemon: Shin Sedai 
Shumei, New Age Shutsudo takes you back to the 
world of the "updated" Goemon in which you control 
a younger and less humorous version of Goemon who 
fights crime in modern Japan instead of the 
classic wacky ninja that tries to save feudal 
Japan and originated the Ganbare Goemon series. 
 
Borrowing the template from the previous portable 
title in the series, the game thrusts you in the 
shoes of either Goemon or his pal Ebisu as they 
traverse side-scrolling stages attempting to 
defeat all enemies within and ultimately save the 
city. 
 
Between levels you take control of the rest of 
Goemon's friends in bonus rounds as they take on 
specific challenges, and the game also brings back 
the Impact sequences, in which you take control of 
giant mechas in first-person sequences and attempt 
to defeat certain bosses.

Isaac is from the town of Vale, on the island of

Psynergy, the technique of moving objects without 
touching them. Mages from the rival island of 
Gondowan plan to destroy Angara by using four 
Elemental Stones, so Isaac has assembled a team to 
snatch the stones. 
 
In the universe of this role-playing game, four 
different types of elements (fire, water, wind and 
earth) are combined to create spells. Combat often 
involves facing multiple monsters at each time. 
 
Djinni creatures can be captured and used to give 
one of your characters extra strengths. Energy is 
needed to cast spells, but this constantly 
replenishes while you are not using one. A 
two-player link-up game exists.

Guilty Gear X - Advance Edition (c) Aug, 2002 Arc 
System Works Co., Ltd. / Sammy Studios, Inc. 
 
When the humans created artificial beings named 
"gears" in 22th century, they didn't expect that 
their creation will eventually turn against them. 
Because gears had no will of their own and could 
only obey humans. Only one gear, named Justice, 
was able to transfer his will onto other gears and 
to rebel against the humans. In year 2180, Justice 
was killed as a result of a bloody tournament 
organized by the Sacred Order of Holy Knights. Yet 
recently, a new gear was discovered. He showed no 
signs of hostility, yet he had no master and was 
roaming about free. It was impossible to capture 
or to kill him because he was immensely strong. 
Fearing a new Justice will grow out of this gear, 
the Order organized yet another tournament, this 
time with a solid prize: five hundred thousand 
world dollars for the winner. 
 
"Guilty Gear X" is a follow up to  Guilty Gear, 
and is also a 2D fighting game. There are now 16 
characters available for you to choose. The battle 
system became more complicated, thanks to the 
variety of moves you can perform. Beside special 
attacks which you can execute if you build up your 
Tension Gauge by attacking or advancing towards 
your opponent, there is also a variety of 
defensing moves to perform. The instant kill moves 
are back from the previous game.

Guru Logi Champ (c) Nov 29, 2001 Champ Team / 
Compile 
 
Guru Logi Champ is a Japanese-only puzzle game.  
In it, you control a cannon manned by two ducks.  
Each level shows a grid with missing blocks that 
you must fill in using your cannon.  You can only 
fire and suck in certain bricks from this grid, 
and any blocks you shoot must land on another 
block so that they stop moving.  It's up to you to 
use a combination of shooting and sucking, as well 
as rotating the screen using the L and R Buttons, 
to fill in any missing blocks from the grid.  When 
this is complete, the level will end, and you will 
be shown that the missing blocks created a 
picture. 
 
The game has a series of levels, each with their 
own set of puzzles.  There is a main goal for each 
level.  In one, ducks in spiky eggshells have 
stolen a tap handle, and a thirsty athlete needs a 
drink of water.  You need to solve a set amount of 
puzzles before you can break the last puzzle in 
the stage open, solve it, and reclaim the item 
needed to help the person or people for that 
stage. 
 
Multiplayer mode features the same basic mechanics 
as single player, except that the puzzles are 
extremely simplified (usually not requiring more 
than four blocks to fill).  Each player has their 
own puzzle grid to manipulate, and the first 
player to fill in all of their blocks wins the 
round.  This makes for some very hectic and close 
matches against other players.  Whoever wins the 
most out of the preset amount of rounds wins the 
game.

Harlem Globetrotters - World Tour (c) 2006 Full 
Fat Productions Ltd. / Destination Software, Inc. 
 
Harlem Globetrotters: World Tour is a licensed 
basketball game featuring 2-on-2 matches. There 
are two main modes: Quick Match (only the fourth 
quarter of a game) and World Tour. The latter has 
the player go through a series of matches, beating 
the other teams to become world champion with 
gameplay similar to the NBA Jam games. Each 
character has a range of statistics such as speed, 
offense, defense and stamina. All the regular 
moves are present: player switches, a tip off, 
passing, 1-2 passing, shooting, targetting, steals 
and dunks with hoop hanging. 
 
While playing, a stamina bar is shown. A temporary 
boost can be activated, but the amount will slowly 
decrease during the match and eventually 
substitutions may be needed. Another feature is 
the special bar, fed by impressive dunks and 
passes. When maxed out, players are able to 
perform special dunks. 
 
Progressing through the World Tour unlocks new 
teams. The DS version adds multiplayer support for 
two players.

Harry Potter and the Chamber of Secrets (c) Nov 
15, 2002 Eurocom Entertainment Software / 
Electronic Arts, Inc. 
 
The game for Game Boy Advance based on the second 
Harry Potter book and movie is, like its 
predecessor, an action adventure, this time with 
an isometric perspective. 
 
In Harry's second year at Hogwarts, bad things are 
happening. The ancient Chamber of Secrets has been 
opened, and what lurks within is attacking 
students. To get through this ordeal alive (and 
advance the plot) Harry must again complete 
various challenges. 
These mostly consist of navigating large mazes - 
fighting monsters, solving puzzles, flipping 
switches and pressing buttons for doors to open. 
Six spells are available to help. As Harry is 
often in places he shouldn't be, stealth sequences 
are also a large part of the game. To avoid 
teachers and prefects, he can sneak around slowly 
and hide behind curtains. If he is caught, he is 
thrown out (to try again) and house points can be 
deducted. 
 
As in other Potter games, there are a lot of 
collectibles, found both in plain view and in 
hidden areas. Sets of Famous Wizard cards unlock 
bonuses, Every Flavour Beans get Harry passwords 
that let him move through shortcuts in the school 
and Chocolate Frogs increase his maximum stamina. 
 
Finally, Quidditch is also back in this game, this 
time in three-dimensional space, viewed from the 
back.

Harry Potter and the Goblet of Fire (c) Nov 08, 
2005 Magic Pockets / Electronic Arts, Inc. 
 
Take on the role of Harry, Ron and Hermione as 
they begin their fourth year at Hogwarts School of 
Witchcraft and Wizardry. This year, the Triwizard 
Tournament takes place, and Harry is mysteriously 
entered into the tournament himself. 
 
Harry Potter and the Goblet of Fire for the 
Nintendo DS and Game Boy Advance is a top-down 
action/adventure game where you play as the three 
friends and progress through the story based on 
the book and film. 
 
Make your way through various scenarios by 
attacking enemies and solving puzzles using 
spells. One button fires a ranged spell, such as 
Confoundus, while another is used for stream 
spells, like Wingardium Leviosa, which can be 
moved around with the Control Pad. You can also 
call your friends for added power to your magical 
spells. 
 
The DS version includes a small bonus game where 
you take care of a magical creature called a 
'Niffler'. It is a simulation game, like a very 
simple Tamagotchi. You can feed the Niffler, clean 
it, and give it toys - depending on what you do, 
it will become more or less pleased with you.  
Perform well enough, and it will become really 
happy, and let you pat it to make it even happier.

Harry Potter and the Sorcerer's Stone (c) Nov 16,

The first Harry Potter game for the Game Boy 
Advance is an action adventure that lets you play 
as Harry in his first year at Hogwarts School of 
Witchcraft and Wizardry, following the story of 
the book and the movie. 
 
You control Harry from an overhead view and must 
complete several tasks. These range from mundane 
class assignments like collecting ingredients for 
a potion to facing off against a giant troll. To 
master these challenges, Harry can learn five 
spells that allow him to push back opponents, flip 
switches, open doors, levitate objects and more. 
If Harry is hurt, he can find and eat Bertie 
Bott's Every Flavor Beans to regain health. By 
performing admirably in learning spells and 
completing missions, Harry can gain extra House 
Points so that Gryffindor might win the House Cup. 
If he misbehaves by attacking other students, or 
being caught wandering the halls at night, points 
will be deducted, however. 
As seeker for the Gryffindor team, Harry must also 
compete in Quidditch matches. The game has a 
special mode for Quidditch and other events where 
Harry might have to mount his broom.

Following in the footsteps of Harvest Moon: 
Friends of Mineral Town, on this occasion you play 
the part of a young girl striving for a new life 
in the country. To do so, you have to build and 
maintain a farm while making friends with the 
locals, keeping a track of your funds and taking a 
closer look at your love life ... there's some 
bachelors out there waiting. 
 
The main aim of the game is to maintain your farm. 
To do so, you must plant and take care of various 
kinds of crops, keep your own home in order and 
feed the livestock. You'll have the opportunity to 
both buy and sell goods, since without money the 
farm will soon fall under. 
 
Making friends and attending various events in the 
town will also help to gain your character some 
extra items, more business and perhaps that life 
partner who can help you out, in more ways then 
one. 
 
More Friends of Mineral Town also connects to

items before time runs out. In Pursuit the player

In Ice Climber one or two players need to climb 
their way to the top of 32 different mountains. 
Each mountain is broken up into eight levels of 
platforms along with a bonus stage at the top. 
Attempting to stop you from making upward progress 
are different creatures ranging from polar bears 
to condors as well as treacherous landscapes with 
falling icicles, moving platforms, and icy floors. 
To help out, your only weapon is a mallet which 
can be used to knock out enemies as well as bust 
away bricks in the platforms to give you some room 
to jump up to the next level. When you finally 
reach the top, it's time to move on to the next, 
more difficult level.

Incredibles, The (c) Nov 01, 2004 Helixe / THQ 
Inc. 
 
In the game based on the movie of the same name, 
you take control of Mr. Incredible when he is 
summoned to the island of Nomanisan for a secret 
assignment. The GBA version is a side-scrolling 2D 
beat-em-up. Initially, you can only play as Mr. 
Incredible but the other members of the family, 
along with Frozone, are playable in the later 
levels. The main buttons are used for basic 
attacks, combos and jumps, and the R button 
triggers special abilities known as 
"incredi-moves". Each member has a different 
special move: Mr. Incredible gets super strength, 
Dash runs faster, Violet has a force field and 
becomes invisible, and Helen can extend her arms. 
Using these depletes an additional meter on the 
screen. It is recharged by collecting icons and 
defeating enemies. 
 
Next to the icons used for incredi-moves, you can 
also collect band-aid to restore your health, 
extra lives, and frozone bottles. There are more 
than 30 levels, with a few chase sequences 
(playing as Dash), and familiar characters such as 
Syndrome, E and Bomb Voyage make an appearance. 
Both the enemies, carrying a variety of weapons, 
and the levels have a distinct hand-drawn, 
comic-book look, rather than mimicking the 3D 
visuals from the film. After completing a level, 
you receive a password to continue the next time.

Invincible Iron Man, The (c) Dec 10, 2002 Torus 
Games Pty. Ltd. / Activision Publishing, Inc. 
 
Trouble at Stark Enterprises: Tony Stark aka Iron 
Man finds that one of his Iron Man suits has been 
stolen. Given enough time, the thief might be able 
to reverse engineer the technology and use it to 
find weaknesses to exploit or, even worse, 
duplicate it and use it for sinister purposes. 
Thankfully, each suit is outfitted with a locator 
beacon. Tony slips into one of his remaining suits 
and sets out to get the stolen suit back and find 
out who is behind the theft. 
 
Iron Man's quest will take him through a number of 
large levels in a side-scrolling platformer. His 
primary weapon against the many enemies awaiting 
him is the repulsor blast fired from the gauntlets 
of the suit. Another attack is a quick shoulder 
tackle. The boot jets of the suit allow Iron Man 
to get to places not reachable with a normal jump. 
 
Firing the repulsor blast depletes the energy 
supply of the suit. The supply slowly recharges on 
its own, but a quicker way to regain spent energy 
is finding energy powerups. Other powerups include 
health boosts and some special weapons. 
 
At the end of some levels, boss battles await. 
Between the levels, comic-style cutscenes continue 
the storyline.

Tokyo-to, a city not unlike Tokyo, somewhere in 
Asia, in the near future. This is the story about 
the GG's, one of three rival teenage gangs who 
ride motorised inline skates and are tagging the 
streets with graffiti. There is a turf war going 
on between the gangs GG's, the Poison Jam, and the 
high-tech freaks, the Noise Tanks. The evil 
Rokkaku Corporation has the corrupt police in 
their grasp, and, headed by Captain Onishima, the 
cops are hell-bent on subduing the unruly teen 
protagonists. But there is light in the darkness: 
the underground DJ, "Professor K," and his Jet Set 
Radio station keep tabs on what is happening on 
the streets of Tokyo-to, and soon our teens will 
have something much darker than the police to 
worry about. 
 
As one of the GG's, you skate through a variety of 
different levels, from busy streets to run-down 
rooftops and smelly sewers where you learn new 
moves, collect spray cans, and tag the streets 
with graffiti. New graffiti designs can be 
unlocked by finding "Graffiti Souls" in levels, by 
designing new graffiti yourself, or by going 
online and downloading any images you find while 
browsing the internet. Fight the rival gangs 
"Poison Jam" and the "Noise Tanks", the evil 
mega-corporation Rokkaku and their police cronies 
in this fresh take on the platform genre, mixing 
traditional platform elements with skating similar 
to that of the Tony Hawk's Pro Skater games. 
Players are scored on their performance in a 
level, both on the level of graffiti attempted as 
well as optional tags and skating tricks. As the 
game progresses challenge maps open that test the 
player's ability to do larger tags, more tricks, 
or race against an opponent. 
 
The American and European release contained two 
new levels based on New York. The story and order 
that you meet characters was modified to include 
these two levels. Both releases also have 
different unique soundtracks for these levels.

JGTO Kounin Golf Master: Japan Golf Tour Game is 
the first in the genre to appear on the GBA 
platform as one of the Japanese launch games. The 
game features 14 characters and multiple courses 
with different themes and with about 20 holes 
each. There is a match mode to go against 
AI-controlled players to beat their ranking or 
another mode for just one player. 
 
Gameplay is divided into two different parts. 
Players use a top-down overview to track the ball 
and the hole, while the putting and swinging is 
done from a third-person perspective. Taking the 
wind into account, players can choose from 
different clubs, determine the direction and 
finally the strength of the shot based on a moving 
bar requiring the player's timing for accuracy. 
Obstacles on the course such as sand or trees 
influence the shots and there are also different 
weather conditions. In the match mode games are 
announced by a TV anchor. The game keeps detailed 
statistics of the score and the player's handicap. 
Courses and new characters are unlocked gradually. 
 
Most of the game's content was later used in the 
US GBA game ESPN Final Round Golf 2002 with some 
minor differences.

Juka and the Monophonic Menace (c) Oct, 2006 
Orbital Media, Inc. / SouthPeak Interactive, LLC 
 
A long time ago, the mysterious "Ancients" created 
machines across the land that were able to harness 
the power of sound.  The Ancients disappeared, 
leaving only their devices for future 
civilizations to discover.  Years later, the 
"Settlers" arrived and built their cities in the 
lands where the machinery was left, and all was 
prosperous. 
 
However, nothing remains perfect forever.  
Powerful alchemists tried to harness the power of 
the Ancients' machines in their lust for power, 
and war broke out.  Those that tried to use the 
Ancients' machines, or The Dark Alchemists, as 
they became known, were killed or exiled, and 
peace eventually returned.  Rumour has it though, 
that the last of the Dark Alchemists, the 
Monophonic Menace, has returned to conquer the 
world. 
 
Juka and the Monophonic Menace is an 
action-adventure game.  The title character, Juka, 
is an alchemist who can collect ingredients from 
trees, water, bushes, and other places to mix and 
create potions.  Potions can be used as a form of 
defense against enemies, can alter the landscape, 
or even activate machines.  Juka also has a "Sound 
Staff", which can be used to absorb and fire back 
different types of sounds at certain enemies.

dugtrios, donphans, sudowoodos and boulders. 
 
The goal is to see how long you can last before 
touching one of these creatures, some are easier 
to hit than other. Once you lose the poor doduo 
will cry in shame. 
 
The game can be accessed by scanning the long 
dot-code on the Pokemon-e Aquapolis cards Doduo 
(73/147) and Dodrio (46/147). Or in Japan Pokemon 
e-card expansion 3 cards Doduo (61/87) and Dodrio 
(62/87).

A unique combination of side-scrolling platform 
and puzzle solving genres, where you must solve 
the puzzles behind the DNA of many of the 
dinosaurs featured in the movie Jurassic Park 3, 
and many others featured in the rest of the 
Jurassic Park movie series. 
 
You start by choosing one of two characters, a 
professional photographer or pilot, and find your 
way through more than 12 levels of side-scrolling 
action, dodging dino's and other dangerous 
hazards. Along the paths are pieces of DNA. The 
task for each level is to collect enough DNA to 
open the exit at the end, opening the second part 
of the game, Dinosaur Creation. 
 
With the DNA you have collected, you must match 
them together correctly to create 10 different 
species of dinosaur. As you reach further into the 
game, the harder it becomes to correctly match the 
DNA samples.

Fat Productions Ltd. / Midway Home Entertainment,

Justice League: Chronicles is the sequel to 
Injustice for All and like its predecessor, is 
based on the Cartoon network Justice League 
animated series. 
 
When Martian Manhunter spots a powerful psychic 
presence in the arctic, it's up to the other six 
members of the Justice League to investigate.  
each level, you'll control a pair of super-heroes. 
 In single-player, you'll switch between them with 
the select button and the inactive character will 
be handled by the AI.  There is also a cooperative 
mode, where a second player links up and you each 
control a character. 
 
There are three sets of levels: Green Lantern and 
Flash, Superman and Wonder Woman and finally 
Batman and Hawkgirl.  The levels are presented in 
a pseudo-3D fashion with characters able to move 
along the x and z axes.  Levels could have you 
moving up, left right or down to reach your 
objective, or stuck in one place with the enemies 
coming to you. 
 
The fighting system involves the standard jump and 
attack button, but also has special attacks that 
are unique to each character.  This attack is 
controlled by a special meter below the health 
meter.  use of you character's special completely 
depletes this meter and it cannot be used again 
until the meter fills back up, which takes several 
seconds. 
 
In addition to the main story mode, there is a 
Watchtower training mode which allows you to use 
any pair of characters in any level.  However, you 
cannot use two of the same character.

Justice League Heroes - The Flash (c) Oct 17, 2006 
WayForward Technologies / Warner Bros. Interactive 
Entertainment Inc. 
 
Justice League Heroes: The Flash is a handheld 
spin-off of Justice League Heroes. You play as The 
Flash in a game that plays something like Final 
Fight on speed. 
 
An army of robots has invaded Earth, starting with 
Flash's hometown of Keystone City. Flash must 
defeat them there as well as other DC Comics' 
locales such as Metropolis, Gotham City and the 
Amazon. 
 
As usual for this genre, you walk from left to 
right and punch and kick enemies using combo 
attacks until their life-bar is depleted with an 
occasional boss-battle. However, this has the 
added twist of Flash's super speed powers. There 
is a button to instantly dash to the next enemy 
and another slows down time, though Flash himself 
still moves normally, allowing him to run around 
defeating multiple enemies before they can react. 
 
While Flash is the only playable character, other 
Justice League members do have cameo appearances, 
Black Canary, Superman, Wonder Woman, Martian 
Manhunter and Green Arrow can all be summoned to 
proved brief assistance in clearing enemies. 
 
In addition to the main story mode, there is a 
boss rush mode, a minigame where you race Superman 
and a making-of.

into the game and surf. 
 
PS2, XB, and GC description, further below is the

2: Kiteretsu Shogun Magginesu for the GBA. In both

fight evil across the land. 
 
Both games are action platformers, with the unique 
addition of several mini-games and different 
gameplay sequences to mix things up a little. 
Goemon (and his pal Ebisumaru in the sequel) can 
use a wide variety of weapons and items, which can 
be collected in-game or bought at special stores. 
 
For the GBA version both games have been updated 
with a save-game feature, as well as with minor 
fixes and additions (such as the ability to switch 
characters on the fly). There's also a new 
playable character for the second game, new 
graphic effects and new mini-games which once

Kid Icarus (c) Aug 10, 2004 Nintendo Co., Ltd. / 
Nintendo Co., Ltd. 
 
Far away in peaceful Angel Land lived a young 
angel warrior named Pit, who has been given the 
task of defeating the monstrous Medusa, who wishes 
to destroy Angel Land and all of the people, and 
she has started by kidnapping Palutena, the 
Princess of Angel Land. 
 
Young Pit must rescue the Princess and restore 
peace to Angel Land. He will travel from the deep 
caverns of the Underworld to Medusa's palace in 
the sky on his journey, and deadly monsters will 
attack him every step of the way. But he has the 
power of the Gods on his side! A powerful bow and 
arrows, Water of Life, and Angel Feathers will 
assist Pit on his quest to destroy Medusa and save 
the princess! 
 
Kid Icarus is a platform game where the player 
goes through several vertically outlaid levels, 
shooting enemies with his bow on the way and 
collecting hearts they leave behind. Pit's bow can 
shoot both forward and upwards. As Pit continues 
upwards, more and more of the level ends up beyond 
the bottom of the screen and if Pit falls down out 
of the screen, he dies. 
 
The levels contain doors which lead to chambers of 
various types - some chambers are filled with 
enemies, some are treasuries which allow Pit to 
obtain a power-up, some are stores where Pit can 
buy stuff, some will replenish his health, in some 
Pit will be able to take a test in hopes of 
getting a powerful weapon, and finally some 
chambers give Pit a chance of receiving a strength 
upgrade, therefore increasing the amount of damage 
his attacks deal. 
 
Pit earns experience as he defeats enemies, and he 
gains levels from this experience. The more levels 
Pit has, the more maximum health he has. 
 
Hearts taken from enemies are used in shops to buy 
various items and power-ups. Items include a 
protective shield which harms enemies, a more 
powerful bow, a mallet which allows you to smash 
the poor Palutena's warriors turned to stone who 
will later help you to fight a boss, a torch to 
see yourself in dark areas and others.

Kim returns to battle fiendish villains once

her klutzy partner, Ron Stoppable.  Together the 
pair work as a team to take on Monkey Fist, Senior 
Senior Sr. and Jr., and of course, the 
ever-incompetent Dr. Drakken, as they try to work 
out who stole Kim's grandmother's photo album. 
 
Players must use both Kim and Ron effectively as 
they make their way through the many large levels 
of Team Possible.  Each character has their own 
strengths and weaknesses: Ron does not have much 
attack power, but he makes up for this later by 
getting better gadgets than Kim.  Kim, on the 
other hand, can defeat enemies without much 
difficulty, but cannot access particular areas 
without Ron's help. 
 
The game is also unique in that two players can 
link up and play the game co-operatively, with one 
playing as Kim, and the other as Ron.  This also 
makes certain sections, such as the rocket skate 
racing levels, more competitive.

A millionaire named Gustav Munchausen is 
organizing and sponsoring another edition of the 
world-famous "King of Fighters" Tournament. With 
the championship invitations in hand, the fighters 
(some of them) decided to participate not just to 
compare their strength, but also to investigate 
rumors that Gustav is involved with serial 
kidnappings involving children and also his 
involvement with a secret operation related to the 
Orochi Power. 
 
Being the second installment of the KOF Series on 
Nintendo's 32-bit handheld, this title brings a 
lot of gameplay characteristics and elements taken 
from its arcade/console counter-part The King of 
Fighters 2000 like the backgrounds and a good part 
of its musical repertoire. 
 
However, a set of additional stuff was included, 
like the appearance of 3 all-new exclusive 
characters (the male Reiji Okami and the females 
Miu Kurosaki and Jun Kagami), 2 new backgrounds, a 
modified Striker System (where the 2nd and 3rd 
players of a team will assume progressively this 
function) and a "Ranking Mode", where you'll be

King of Fighters EX, The - NeoBlood (c) Nov 05, 
2002 Artoon Co., Ltd.|Marvelous Entertainment Inc. 
/ Sammy Studios, Inc. 
 
Two years have now passed since the last edition 
of "King of Fighters" Tournament, accomplished in 
1997: after Orochi was sealed by the joint forces 
of Kyo Kusanagi, Chizuru Kagura and Iori Yagami, 
all the fighters returned to their normal lives. 
But suddenly, a mysterious host decided to reopen 
the tournament and have been sent serial 
invitations to the most powerful fighters. But 
there are many secrets surrounding this happy-hour 
fighting clash, as the apparent disappearance of 
Iori Yagami and a remote distrust behind this 
unknown sponsor: that he would be using the 
championship to accomplish secret operations 
involving (maybe) the Orochi power... 
 
This title marks the first installment of King of 
Fighters Series on Nintendo's 32-bit handheld. It 
brings a lot of gameplay characteristics based in 
both KOF Evolution (most of the graphic stuff and 
principally both "Striker" System and backgrounds, 
now represented by a static 2D frame instead of 
the original 3D ones) and KOF 2000 (the musical 
repertoire). 
 
Besides the traditional game modes (Team Play, 
Team Battle, Single Play, Single Battle, Endless 
Survival and Survival Time Attack), this game 
marks too the debut of a new-exclusive female 
character named Moe Habana. 
 
With the permanence of 3 on 3 combats (plus 
Striker Attacks) and the introduction of a new 
female fighter, the main cast is composed by: 
 
1. Hero Team: Kyo Kusanagi, Benimaru Nikaido, 
   Moe Habana and Shingo Yabuki 
2. Fatal Fury Team: Terry Bogard, Andy Bogard, 
   Mai Shiranui and Joe Higashi 
3. Art of Fighting Team: Ryo Sakazaki, Robert 
   Garcia, King and Yuri Sakazaki 
4. Ikari Team: Leona Heidern, Ralf Jones, Clark 
   Steel and Whip 
5. Psycho Soldier Team: Athena Asamiya, Sie 
   Kensou, Bao and Chin Gentsai 
6. Korea Team: Kim Kaphwan, Chang Koehan, Choi 
   Bounge and Jhun Hoon

Kirby & The Amazing Mirror (c) Oct 18, 2004 
Flagship Co., Ltd.|HAL Laboratory, Inc. / Nintendo

Kirby stars in his first four-player simultaneous 
adventure!  There's trouble in neighboring Mirror 
World, but when Kirby goes off to help, he's 
attacked by a shadowy Meta Knight and split into 
four colored versions of himself!  The four 
Kirbies set off for Mirror World on an exciting 
new adventure! 
 
Kirby & The Amazing Mirror is set out in a 
Metroid-style manner.  The game features one 
sprawling overworld that players gradually uncover 
as they progress through the game.  It's also 
possible to discover hidden treasure chests that 
show the player the overworld layouts, life bar 
extensions, different colors for Kirby, and 
unlockable music and sound effects. 
 
Amazing Mirror uses the familiar 'suck-in and 
copy' mechanic of other Kirby games, but the 
addition of having four players able to co-operate 
simultaneously can make the game easier or more 
difficult - depending on the situation.  There are 
also three mini-games to play via the Game Boy 
Advance Single-Cart Multiplayer feature.

Klonoa returns in another puzzle-platform game for 
the Game Boy Advance.  In this sequel, Klonoa is 
whisked away to a heroes tournament, where he must 
compete against friends and foes alike for the 
title of "Greatest Hero". 
 
New enemies and puzzles await for players, with 
Klonoa now able to plant enemies in flower pots, 
creating a makeshift ladder.  He can also grab 
hold of electric foes that will rocket him through 
breakable blocks and enemies.  The side goal of 
collecting all a stage's Dream Stones returns, and 
in addition to this, there is also a special 'Sun 
Stone' hidden in each stage.  Diligent players 
will be rewarded with bonus tougher levels to 
complete. 
 
In addition to the standard puzzle-like platform 
stages, there are also fast-paced hoverboard 
races.  These stages auto-scroll upwards, and have 
Klonoa facing the top of the screen.  Players need 
quick reflexes to make it through these tricky 
stages.  In addition to this, deadly bosses await, 
in tough left to right auto-scrolling boss stages 
- you'll have to be quick on your feet to make it 
to the end...or get crushed by the boss 
relentlessly chasing you!

Klonoa - Empire of Dreams (c) Aug 30, 2001 Namco

Klonoa stars in his first adventure for the Game 
Boy Advance.  An emperor who cannot sleep who has 
banned dreaming, and Klonoa has been imprisoned 
for breaking the law.  Klonoa must go on another 
adventure to save the empire and allow the 
residents to dream once again. 
 
Klonoa: Empire of Dreams is a lot more 
puzzle-focused than the PlayStation versions of 
the game.  Most of the game is very slow paced, so 
that players can take their time and carefully 
think about their next move.  You still use the 
same mechanic of inflating your enemies and using 
them to either double jump or throw them at other 
enemies, but the action now takes place on a fixed 
2D area. 
 
Players can also aim to collect all the Dream 
Stones within the levels, which will unlock secret 
bonuses.  Auto-scrolling surfing levels break up 
the puzzle-level action, and are much more hectic.

Kong - The 8th Wonder of the World (c) Nov 21, 
2005 Ubisoft Divertissements Inc. / Ubisoft, Inc. 
 
Based off Peter Jackson's King Kong movie that was 
released in 2005, you are now able to play the 
movie. 
 
The plot consist of film maker, Carl Denham 
wanting to make one of best movies.  He finds 
theater actress Ann Darrow and wants her to play 
the part of one of his characters.  Carl gets 
writer Jack Driscoll to finish Carl's script while 
they are traveling on a ship to an island that 
Carl believes to be real, but no one else does.  
He plans to shoot his movie there.  Once they 
arrive at the island known as Skull Island, Ann is 
captured and now Carl, Jack, & the cast of Carl's 
movie goes out to find her. 
 
This is a top-view game with cartoon-like visuals 
and some Legend Of Zelda type gameplay.  You start 
out with Jack, Carl, & Ann and at that point, you 
learn how to play the game in a short tutorial.  
Jack has a machete and a tommy gun so that makes 
him the attacker against the creatures that lurk 
on Skull Island.  Carl has grenades.  You could 
attack enemies with it, but your suppose to use 
them for getting rocks out of the way that block 
the entrance of caves.  Ann (in the beginning) can 
heal Jack & Carl.  After Ann is captured, you have 
to play as Jack & Carl. 
 
You can also play as King Kong a few times in the 
game.  They are short levels that consist of you 
playing as Kong in levels that are timed and that 
are like beat-em-up games we've seen in the past, 
and you slowly beat up the creatures that come 
after you.  You also get an energy boost when you 
defeat most of the enemies.

Kururin Paradise (c) Dec 06, 2002 Eighting,Raizing 
/ Nintendo Co., Ltd. 
 
Kururin Paradise is the sequel to the GBA launch 
title, Kuru Kuru Kururin. In this game, Kururin 
and his family see an advertisement for the 
circus, which takes place at 6:00. Kururin's 
family arrive there on time, but Kururin is late, 
and when he gets there, everybody is missing! It's 
up to Kururin to search across the land for his 
missing family using his faithful helicopter, the 
Heririn. As in the first game, Kururin must 
navigate his way through fairly narrow mazes, 
trying not to hit the walls. Three consecutive 
hits, and the Heririn is destroyed, and you must 
start the stage again. 
 
Paradise is vastly improved from the original 
game. It is now possible to find hidden keys in 
the levels, which open up locked doors, allowing 
for branched paths in the world map. Certain paths 
also lead to boss encounters, which take the form 
of an addictive mini-game including, but not 
limited to, lawn mowing, gathering stars, flying 
Kururin himself through clouds, and hopping across 
a path dodging helicopter blades. If you beat the 
boss, these mini-games are then added to your 
mini-game library, where you can play them against 
up to three friends using only one cart. 
 
The game also features twelve toys built in that 
can be accessed by selecting one from a menu, then 
turning your GBA off, then on again. Most of them 
are fairly useless or incomprehensible in 
Japanese, but there are a couple of interesting 
ones, like the love tester, the musical note 
player, and the memory match game.

Lara Croft - Tomb Raider Legend (c) Nov 10, 2006 
Human Soft Inc. / Eidos Interactive Ltd. 
 
The GBA version of Lara Croft Tomb Raider: Legend 
is a side-scrolling platform game more similar to 
the DS version instead of the 3D console versions 
by a different development studio. Unlike the 
previous GBA game in the series, a side view is 
used instead of more titled, overhead camera 
perspective. 
 
The plot is the same as the console versions. In a 
search for the relic Lara Croft travels through 
Japan, Bolivia, England, Kazakhstan, Ghana and the 
Himalayas. She get some new tools in this game to 
help her during the search for the relic. The PDA 
for instance, provides real-time statistics and 
updates on objectives. The grapple hook can be 
used to swing over pits and also captures enemies. 
A headset is used to keep contact with Zip who 
follows Lara through the cam and informs her about 
new objectives when they become available. 
 
Lara can also jump, attack with her guns, and she 
needs to swing to new platforms, avoid obstacles 
and take out enemies and animals in her way. 
Timing and precision is essential to reach 
platforms, much like the early Prince of Persia 
games. New guns are collected when enemies drop 
them, but this does not change the sprite of the 
weapon Lara is holding. There are also a number of 
vehicle sequences where Lara is driving a bike. 
 
The cut-scenes that progress the story are shown 
as pages from a comic book, with bubble dialogue. 
After collecting treasure, it can be exchanged in 
the main menu to unlock a number of mini-games, 
cinematics, character profiles, cheat codes and a 
time trial mode to complete levels as fast as 
possible.

Lara Croft discovers a manuscript which speaks of 
a mysterious occult magic which will bring 
desolation on earth in the near future. This 
prophecy also talks of three legendary stones 
which are linked with the mentioned devastation. 
Fascinated, Lara travels around the globe in 
search of these fabled stones. 
 
Along the way she'll meet enemies both human and 
otherwise and will also have to deal with dark 
magic of sorts. 
 
Lara is now in a "quasi-3D" isometric/top-down 
environment, as opposed to the 2D-platformer view 
of the previous handheld (GBC) versions. This view 
proves helpful while Lara runs, jumps, shimmys, 
shoots around. 
 
Although there is lack of a save feature, there is 
a password system which lets you restore back to 
'almost' where you left.

Legend of Spyro, The - A New Beginning (c) Oct 12, 
2006 Big Ant Studios Pty Ltd / Vivendi Universal 
Games, Inc. 
 
When the Dark Master attacked the sacred temple, 
the Fire Guardian, Ignitus, could only manage to 
save one of the dragon eggs from being destroyed.  
This egg found its way to a family of dragonflies, 
who raised the newly hatched dragon as one of 
their own, along with their son Sparx.  The 
dragon, Spyro, soon discovered his heritage, and 
with Sparx, began on a quest to discover himself 
and eventually, save the world from the Dark 
Master's forces. 
 
The Legend of Spyro: A New Beginning is a 
side-scrolling platformer based on the console 
game of the same name.  As Spyro, players can 
attack with melee attacks and charge tackles.  In 
addition to this, breath attacks are unlocked as 
players progress through the game, allowing Spyro 
to control the elements of fire, ice, earth and 
lightning.  The R Button will let Spyro fire a 
stream of breath, while the L Button will hurl a 
ranged attack at foes.  Finally, players can press 
L and R together when their purple Fury Meter is 
full to unleash a more powerful attack. 
 
A New Beginning also features mini-games such as a

Recently, famine and drought have plagued Hyrule.  
When all seemed lost, a mysterious wizard, 
Agahnim, appeared, and stopped these strange 
happenings from occurring.  But there is talk that 
Agahnim now rules the country with his magic, 
behind the scenes.  And then, one night, the 
Princess of Hyrule, Zelda, calls out for 
help...and the one who hears her pleas is a young 
lad named Link... 
 
The Legend of Zelda: A Link to the Past is a 
top-down action adventure game (similar to the 
original Legend of Zelda) for the Super Nintendo 
and Game Boy Advance.  Players assume the role of 
Link, and their goal is to rescue Princess Zelda 
and save the land of Hyrule.  Unlike turn-based 
RPGs, all combat in Link to the Past is in 
real-time - you swing your sword at enemies by 
pressing a button, or can spin the sword around 
you for a more powerful attack by holding down the 
button until it is charged. 
 
Progression through the game is done by conquering 
a series of dungeons - each dungeon has its own 
special item associated with it, such as the 
hookshot (which latches onto a far-off object and 
pulls Link across) or the hammer (which can be 
used to flatten objects in your way).  Most of 
these dungeons are rendered impassable until the 
dungeon's particular item is acquired

Classic NES Series - The Legend of Zelda (c) Jun 
07, 2004 Nintendo Co., Ltd. / Nintendo of America 
Inc. 
 
In one of the darkest times in the Kingdom of 
Hyrule, a young, pointy-eared boy named Link takes 
on an epic quest to restore the fragmented 
Triforce of Wisdom and save the Princess Zelda 
from the clutches of the evil, power-hungry Ganon. 
 
The Legend of Zelda for the NES marks the first 
action-adventure title of the popular Nintendo 
series. Players must make their way through the 
various forests, graveyards, plains, and deserts 
of the Overworld to find the secret entrances of 
the eight dungeons in an attempt to piece together 
the broken Triforce. Once all pieces are joined, 
Link will be able to gain entry to Death Mountain, 
home of Ganon, and prison of Princess Zelda. 
 
The game is drawn in a top-down perspective. Link 
begins his quest in the Overworld, which features 
forests, mountains and lakes and is divided into 
several screens. Link can explore the Overworld 
freely, though when he enters a screen, he will 
encounter several enemies. He can attack them with 
his sword. If link is at full health, he can toss 
his sword to attack enemies from afar, but when he 
is hurt, even slightly, he can only fight in melee 
range. 
 
Link's health is represented by hearts

Legend of Zelda, The - The Minish Cap (c) Jan 10, 
2005 Flagship Co., Ltd. / Nintendo of America Inc. 
 
While at a festival with Princess Zelda, Link 
encounters a mysterious mage, called Vaati, who 
turns the princess to stone.  Helpless to stop 
them, Link is asked by the king to meet with a 
race of tiny people known as the Minish, who may 
be able to help with their predicament.  On his 
travels, Link teams up with a talking cap called 
Ezlo, who is able to shrink Link to the size of a 
Minish so that he can meet with them.  With his 
newfound abilities, Link must save the kingdom 
from Vaati's menace. 
 
The Legend of Zelda: The Minish Cap is a top-down 
action adventure game that tells the origins of 
the evil Vaati from Four Swords.  Players take on 
the role of Link as they conquer various dungeons 
to retrieve essential tools to fight enemies and 
progress through various obstacles.  Items such as 
the Mole Mitts allow Link to dig through dirt, 
while the Gust Jar can be used to suck in enemies, 
items, and propel Link.  Link can also shrink down 
to the size of a Minish with the aid of Ezlo, the 
talking cap. 
 
The Minish Cap uses the gameplay mechanic of 
shrinking to make familiar territory new and 
different.  Puddles become huge rivers, baby 
chicks are huge monsters, and regular enemies 
become deadly bosses at Minish size.  Link can 
also trade items called "Kinstones" with people in 
the game - when two pieces of the same Kinstone 
are joined together, new areas open up, treasure 
chests appear, and sometimes, even useful rewards 
are given to Link.

LEGO Star Wars II - The Original Trilogy (c) Sep 
12, 2006 Amaze Entertainment, Inc. / LucasArts|TT 
Games Publishing Ltd 
 
Focused on the original trilogy of the Star Wars 
universe (A New Hope, The Empire Strikes Back and 
The Return of Jedi), the sequel to LEGO Star Wars 
brings some innovations over the first title. 
 
During the story mode, the player is joined 
on-screen by two other characters, and can change 
between them to use their specific skills to 
proceed. Characters share a life bar of four 
hearts, with the rate of depletion changing 
according to each character (a stormtrooper will 
lose three hearts when hit by a blaster, Vader 
will take two or three hits before losing one). If 
a support character is "dismantled" by attacks, 
there's no problem, but letting that happen to the 
controlled character means a loss of stud points 
(the game currency), as well as a drop on the 
"Super Kit" gauge, which replaces the Jedi rank 
evaluation of the previous titles. 
 
Gameplay has been changed to accommodate the lack 
of lightsaber battles in the later episodes, and 
so blasters are a lot more effective and fire 
faster, but have lost their "charge" mode. New 
flight missions are also included. These are 
similar to previous Star Wars games, like Return 
of the Jedi, and allow the player to attack both 
Death Stars, skim the surface of the forest moon 
of Endor in a Speeder, escape from an asteroid 
field with the Millennium Falcon, or draw wires 
around the legs of Imperial walkers in Hoth. 
 
There are three major character classes: droids 
(unable to fight, but the only ones capable of 
opening most regular doors during story mode), 
Jedi (melee fighters capable of interacting with 
larger objects to uncover hidden studs and with 
different Jedi powers) and Blaster users, which 
can fire at an enemy from a distance, as well as 
assemble smaller objects (like short bridges or 
door switches). 
 
Gameplay remains a light jump-and-slash isometric 
game, with the goal being usually to go from point 
A to B, while pulling levers somewhere in the 
level. Like in the first game, the game can not be 
entirely completed without playing in Free Mode (a 
near perfect run in Story mode will only complete 
around 50% of the game), as many doors can only be 
opened, or even reached, by using the unique 
special abilities of one of the 36 unlockable 
characters. 
 
To acquire characters for Free Play, the player 
now needs to accomplish three things: earn enough 
credits (the value of each stud was increased 10 
fold), complete a level (to unlock playable 
characters such as the level variation of Luke or 
Leia), and get all "mini kits" (which replace the 
"Death Star Plans" of the prequel). Characters 
that can be unlocked include enemies, such as the 
Tusken Raider or Stormtroopers, or heroic 
characters, like Yoda. There are also additional 
items to be bought, including music, palette 
swaps, new game modes, lightsaber colours and 
hints.

Lemony Snicket's A Series of Unfortunate Events 
(c) Nov 10, 2004 Griptonite Games / Activision 
Publishing, Inc. 
 
Based on the movie (and first three books of the 
series), Lemony Snicket's a Series of Unfortunate 
Events for Game Boy Advance puts players in the 
unfortunate shoes of the incredibly unlucky 
Baudelaire orphans: Violet, Klaus, and Sunny. 
 
Each orphan has an unusual talent that will let 
them progress through three chapters (each with 
over a dozen levels). Though the game looks like a 
traditional side-scroller, combat takes a backseat 
to clever puzzle-solving and adventure game 
elements. The three orphans must use their 
talents, along with items found in the world, and 
various interactions to escape each level and 
avoid the evil Count Olaf and his elaborate plans 
to inherit the children's fortune. 
 
Inventions also take a big role in this game, and 
players will have to assemble them from common 
household objects. For example, in one level, 
Violet will be hunting for ice cream scoopers, 
soup cans, and a crank to invent an "apple 
chucker" which can help defeat Count Olaf's 
friends. 
 
The game offers quite a bit of replayability, too, 
with quest points and exotic books earned for 
discovering all the game's quirky secrets.

Lizzie McGuire's cheerleading rival, Kate, has 
boasted that there will be no way Lizzie will be 
Homecoming Queen with the unbeatable competition 
of Kate.  Previously uninterested in Homecoming, 
Lizzie suddenly develops a fierce determination to 
show up Kate and swipe the crown from her 
clutches. 
 
Homecoming Havoc plays somewhat like Nintendo's 
Wario Ware, in that players must make their way 
through a series of short mini-games rapidly 
thrown at you one after the other.  While each of 
Wario Ware's stages has a theme, each of 
Homecoming Havoc's minigames in the ten stages are 
randomly selected from the game's minigame 
library. 
 
As players progress through the minigames, they 
earn points and tokens.  Tokens can be used to 
purchase cards that will allow you to skip a 
particular type of minigame if you fail it.  At 
the end of each set of ten minigames, there is a 
Dance Competition.  In this game, players must 
input the correct arrow sequence using the Control 
Pad as the arrows pass along the screen.

they follow a path of evil to the steps of Mount 
Doom, in order to cast the One ring of Sauron back

the evil that lies within it. This first in a 
trilogy follows Frodo and the fellowship as they 
begin their journey to Mount Doom, only to find 
that what lies ahead may be too much to handle. 
 
For the Game Boy Advance RPG, you must battle your 
way past the Ringwraiths in turn based style 
(similar to Final Fantasy and the like) action, 
including the ability to cast spells (thanks to 
Gandalf) as well as solve puzzles and deliver 
messages to many of Middle Earth's characters. 
 
Unlike the movie trilogy, this adaption of the 
tale includes characters not seen on the big 
screen, including Tom Bombadil and others, as well 
as including many of the songs written by Tolkien 
as puzzles.

Lord of the Rings, The - The Third Age (c) Nov 02, 
2004 Griptonite Games / Electronic Arts, Inc. 
 
The Lord of the Rings: The Third Age for the Game 
Boy Advance encompasses the entire Lord of the 
Rings trilogy, but does so in a unique turn-based 
strategy formula. 
 
Unlike the console versions, the Game Boy Advance 
version gives players the option of playing the 
heroes from the trilogy, selecting their commander 
from the likes of Aragorn and Gandalf, or even 
using the evil forces of Mordor and choosing the 
Witch-king or Saruman. 
 
From there, the player experiences over 30 battle 
scenarios, ranging from the well-known battles of 
the film (Helm's Deep and the Pelennor Fields), 
small skirmishes (Amon Hen and Osgiliath), and 
even some more battles just hinted at in the 
movies (Isildur's ambush, Theodred's death at the 
fords of the River Isen). 
 
In each battle, players choose their companions 
(again, classic characters from the films such as 
Legolas and Gimli are available, along with bad 
guys like Wormtongue and Gorbag), and face off 
against the foe with dozens of troops, including 
orcs, trolls, Gondorians, Riders of Rohan, 
Easterlings, Mumakil, and dozens more. 
 
Unlike other turn-based games, you can't move all 
of your units each turn. Rather, the board is 
divided into three "flanks," and your hero in each 
flank generates the command points you use to move 
units in that flank. Thus, good leaders like 
Aragorn may have a lot of command points to give 
his flank (3-4 is typical), while Gimli may have 
less, but be a better warrior to make up for it. 
 
After a battle, you can upgrade your heroes with 
equipment and special skills, and move onward to 
conquer the next area of Middle-earth.

their unique skills to defeat Tomator, as well as 
a vast array of aliens, robots, giant snails, big 
lizards and more. 
 
The Lost Vikings is a side-scrolling platform 
puzzle game with a twist. Instead of one character 
who can jump, run, shoot, collect items, flip 
switches and so on, there are three different 
characters, each with his own skills. Eric the 
Swift can jump, run and bash through walls with 
his tough helmet. Olaf the Stout has a shield 
which can block attacks, function as an air glider 
or as a step to stand on. Baleog the Fierce can 
shoot things with his arrows (including switches) 
or kill things with his sword. The player has to 
use the three Vikings as a team if he wants to get 
past the increasingly difficult levels and 
puzzles. 
 
The player controls one Viking at a time, but can 
switch between them at any point. The Vikings have 
limited space in their inventory which they can 
use to keep various items. Each Viking has three 
health points, and if he loses them all from 
confrontations with dangers, he dies (some threats 
kill instantly), and the level must be restarted.

Neverland Co., Ltd. / Atlus U.S.A., Inc. 
 
The events of this game take place twenty-five 
years before those depicted in  Fortress of Doom. 
You control a young man named Eldin. His father 
was a great treasure hunter who once ventured into 
ancient ruins and never came back. Eldin became a 
hunter himself, and is looking for an adventure 
together with his friends Torma and Rami. Before 
soon the youngsters come into conflict with the 
evil kingdom of Gratze, and realize they have to 
do anything to stop their plans of resurrecting an 
ancient beast. 
 
This is a traditional Japanese RPG with turn-based 
combat viewed from top-down perspective. Enemy

enemy. The characters can master a variety of 
"jobs", learning abilities and switching classes, 
or combining them the way the player likes. You 
can also use special items in battle to capture 
monsters and to make them fight on you side. You 
can also upgrade those monsters and even merge 
with them to become more powerful.

A full day of work for a machop, as everyone 
knows, is pulverizing bouncing boulders with its 
bare hands. This game allows you to take the role 
of a machop who has the respectable workload of 
one hundred boulders ahead of him. 
 
Boulders will bounce from the left and right sides 
of the screen. Some will make little bounces along 
the ground that you wont be able to avoid, others 
describe parabolas which offer significant head 
room. If machop gets beaned by one of the flying 
rocks the game is over, will you survive all one 
hundred? You'll be rewarded by an evolution to 
machoke at fifty boulders smashed, and machamp at 
one hundred.

March of the Penguins (c) Nov, 2006 Skyworks 
Technologies, Inc. / Destination Software, Inc. 
 
Based on the documentary March of the Penguins, 
this game follows the story of the emperor 
penguins as they embark on a long journey to breed 
their young. The game has been divided into twelve 
chapters, with different gameplay. The penguins 
need to be navigated through the environment, find 
a suitable mate, find food, take care of the egg, 
guard the young ones and finally make it all the 
way back. 
 
A large part of the game is based on the concept 
of Lemmings. As the penguins march on, players 
need to help them land softly, melt obstacles, 
attract them in a certain direction using fish and 
place trampolines, ramps, slides, bridges and 
steps to make them access new areas. The levels 
can be explored using binoculars and the penguins 
need to collect a certain amount of snowflakes to 
pass. The penguins cannot die. When they fall off 
a cliff, they simply restart at the beginning of 
the level, but the players needs to bring them to 
the end as a group to succeed. 
 
Other levels have the penguins slide down hills 
with faster gameplay, feature mazes, or take place 
underwater where predators need to be avoided 
while collecting food. In the later parts of the 
game, guarding the eggs adds an new layer of 
difficulty. As soon as a penguin hits an obstacle 
it is dropped. There is little time to pick it up 
again or it freezes. It also need to be taken to a 
warm spot before the thermometer time runs out. 
 
Some educational content has also been included. 
Next to the habits, more information about the 
penguin migration in provided in between levels.

Mario Golf - Advance Tour (c) Jun 21, 2004 Camelot 
Software Planning / Nintendo of America Inc. 
 
Similarly to Mario Golf for Game Boy Color, Mario 
Golf: Advance Tour allows players to create two of 
their own custom characters and experience golf by 
progressing through an RPG-like story.  The 
ultimate goal of the story is to make your player 
climb through the ranks of the various clubs, 
ultimately reaching the goal of the elite Mushroom 
Kingdom golfers, such as Princess Peach, Donkey 
Kong, and of course, Mario. 
 
It's possible to earn experience for either 
character either by playing through rounds of 
golf, or by successfully completing various types 
of mini-games and contests that help you hone your 
putting, swing, and other golf skills.  
Distributing experience is more difficult now, as 
you now have to make sure that both characters are 
sufficiently levelled up so that you can succeed 
in doubles matches as well as your solo play. 
 
Advance Tour also links up to Mario Golf: 
Toadstool Tour for the Nintendo GameCube.  By 
doing this, you can earn even more experience 
points by transferring your characters over and 
playing the various modes in Toadstool Tour.  Of 
course, it's also possible to link up to another 
copy of Advance Tour for GBA multiplayer too.

Mario Party Advance (c) Mar 28, 2005 Hudson Soft 
Company, Ltd. / Nintendo of America Inc. 
 
The first portable incarnation of the Mario Party 
series, Mario Party Advance shakes things up quite 
a bit on the GBA.  With the focus on the 
single-player, there are all kinds of 
single-player mini-games, one giant single-player 
board to traverse instead of multiple ones (Shroom 
City), and all kinds of different Gaddgets and 
gameplay modes to indulge in. 
 
The main single-player experience involves 
traveling across "Shroom City," which is a major 
departure from the standard set-up in past Mario 
Party titles.  You have the choice to be Mario, 
Luigi, Peach, or Yoshi, and depending on who you 
choose, you'll start at a different spot on the 
board, which is quite large. 
 
You're given die rolls to navigate the board and, 
when you reach special sections of the map, 
complete special quests, which often involve 
helping residents of Shroom City and/or 
participating in special challenges.  Most quests 
involve collecting some sort of object elsewhere 
or a mini-game.  By completing these quests, 
you'll collect stars, which eventually allow for 
special boss bouts with Bowser, and you'll unlock 
mini-games and Gaddgets, which are simple, 
toy-like contraptions that you can play with. 
 
The game ends when you complete your allotted 
number of turns, although additional turns and die 
rolls can be earned during the game by completing 
the "Mushroom Challenges" that occur rather often. 
 After completing your session, your rewards are 
saved, and you can play with your mini-games and 
Gaddgets in Play Mode. 
 
There are also two additional modes available, 
"Party Land," where you can play special duel 
mini-games with a friend, and "Challenge Land," 
where you play through special modes that test 
your mini-game skills to earn coins, which can be 
used to purchase additional unlockables in a shop. 
 
Finally, there is also a feature called the "Bonus 
Board."  You can play with a board that is 
included with the game using the GBA.  The GBA 
takes care of die rolls, mini-games, and 
end-of-the-game events.

taking a card from another player, blocking a 
player from from moving, or the challenge of the 
Mario Party games, which is where the GBA comes 
in. 
 
Using the strips on the challenge cards to swipe 
through the e-reader, gamers can take on the Mario 
Party mini-games to win coins and cards from other 
players. 
 
Games consist of one player or multi-player duels, 
and include the likes of Cast Away Mario (which 
has you attempting to catch the correct fish), 
Balloon Burst (a remake of Hot Potato) and Daisy's 
Rodeo, where you must press the right buttons in 
time to keep Daisy from falling off of the bucking 
Bowser.

Mario Pinball Land (c) Oct 04, 2004 Fuse Games 
Limited / Nintendo of America Inc. 
 
This is the standard "Bowser has kidnapped the 
Princess, and Mario must rescue her" story. In 
this case, the Princess is transformed into a ball 
and launched from a Super Mario 64-style cannon, 
which a pair of goombas aim directly at Bowser's 
Castle. Mario is also transformed into a ball and 
chases after her. 
 
There are 5 levels, each consisting of a set of 
pinball tables. Each table has some exits 
(including the one below the flippers) that Mario 
can use to move to other tables. Also, each one 
holds a star, normally obtained by defeating all 
enemies on the table. Some exits require that 
Mario has a certain number of stars. To gain 
access to Bowser's castle, Mario must defeat the 
bosses of the first 4 levels, which gives him star 
keys. The game also features a "Time Attack" mode, 
which allows players to fight already defeated 
bosses again.

Mario Tennis Advance - Power Tour (c) Dec 05, 2005 
Camelot Software Planning / Nintendo of America 
Inc. 
 
Mario Tennis: Power Tour is the portable sibling 
of Mario Power Tennis on the GameCube. 
 
Aside from the standard spins, drop shots, lobs, 
and smashes available in a standard game of 
tennis, Power Tour adds power shots into the mix. 
Offensive power shots can be used to end a 
long-rally in your favor, while defensive power 
shots can help you make an impossible save. 
 
Following in the footsteps of other portable Mario 
Sports titles, Power Tour adds a bit of RPG-like 
features into the mix of standard tennis action. 
Story mode has you guide either one of the rookie 
players, Max or Tina, through the ranks of 
competitors in the academy on their way to the 
Island Open Championships. Winning matches against 
opponents in the academy rewards you with points 
you can use to raise your stats. Matches can 
either be in one-on-one Singles matches, or you 
can team up with an AI-controlled partner in 
Doubles. 
 
In between matches, you are also given the 
opportunity to explore the academy and participate 
in training courts and several mini-games, such as 
weight-lifting, to further build up your stats. 
Exhibition modes are also available for quick 
pick-up-and-play gameplay. Multiplayer modes 
include Singles and Doubles matches where you can 
choose from the stock cast of characters or you 
can also opt to use your powered up characters 
from the Story mode against each other.

Greyskull puts players in the role of He-Man as he 
hacks and slashes through a 13-level quest to

Taking a nod to such classic beat-em ups like 
Golden Axe or Gauntlet, He-Man makes his way 
through the various areas of Eternia fighting 
hordes of Skeletor's underlings while searching 
for keys to open doors, power-ups to enhance 
strength and defense, and He-Man's captured 
friends, such as Man-At-Arms or Cringer.  He-Man 
can stop the enemies from advancing upon him by 
destroying the warp portals that are scattered 
throughout the area. 
 
Along the way, He-Man can even ride on Battle Cat 
through "shooter" style levels to get to new areas 
and face Skeletor's main minions, such as Beast 
Man and Clawful. 
 
Masters of the Universe - He-Man: Power of

  loser.

the Golden Condor. Getting the Condor is the only 
way to score points. 
 
Half Pipe Hell - Up to 8 players can play HotSeat 
style. You must take turns tricking your way up a 
mountain of terraced half pipes. The only way to

more and more points your opponent's screen will 
get smaller and smaller. The loser is the one that

Mazes of Fate (c) Dec, 2006 Sabarasa Entertainment

The ancient gods have passed judgment, and as a 
result all of mankind has been sentenced to be 
replaced with a new, less sinful race. The only 
chance for redemption lies withing a magical item 
that will allow mankind to atone for its sins. But 
the item in question has been stolen by the 
enemies of humanity, and the verdict of the gods 
will soon come to pass. 
 
Mazes of Fate is a fantasy medieval first person 
"dungeon-crawler" RPG in which you create a 
character based on gender, class and attributes 
(or take your pick from one of the three pre-made 
characters) and set out in a quest to save the 
human race from oblivion. The game alternates 
between world and town map sequences in which you 
control your party from an overhead perspective 
and visit shops and get quests from NPCs and the 
many dungeons that compose the bulk of the game 
itself. While dungeon crawling the game switches 
to a first-person perspective from which you 
control your party as it fights all the monsters 
that cross your path and loot the treasures 
uncovered. Combat is real-time although the game 
pauses while you navigate action menus. 
 
Features loads of items, weapons and quests, as 
well as tons of monsters and up to 5 recruit-able 
party members.

Medabots - Metabee Version (c) Mar 31, 2003 
Imagineer Co., Ltd. / Natsume, Inc. 
 
Welcome to the world of MedaBots.  MetaBots are 
robots that can have various parts upgraded and 
swapped to change and improve them.  These parts 
can be purchased, or can be received as the spoils 
of battle if you win. 
 
Enter your character... a boy who loves MedaBots.  
Sent to the store to get Spice-A-Roni, he ends up 
with a MedaBot instead.  From this point on, his 
life is thrown into Robattles with other MedaBots. 
 
MedaBots are made up of a basic body (male or 
female), four main parts (head, legs, right arm, 
and left arm), and a medal.  The medal is what 
powers the MedaBot.  All these parts can be 
changed.  And because each part has multiple 
properties, you don't really "upgrade" your 
MedaBot... you just change it.  Sometimes you will 
want a powerful weapon attack, sometimes you may 
want a less powerful weapon attack that can do 
Chain Damage or Status Damage. 
 
When you battle, you take turns based on the speed 
your MedaBot can reach the center of the field.  
After it attacks, you hurry back to the outside 
and then return to the center.  This is really 
just a timer thing to show how the speed of your 
MedaBot is affecting the attack speeds. 
 
Your attack can damage the various parts of the 
other MedaBot(s) as long as it hits.  Destroying a 
part will prevent the MedaBot from attacking with 
that part.  Destroying the head will give you a 
victory even if you destroy nothing else.  
However, you cannot aim at each part.  The defense 
rating of each part helps determine what is hit 
first. 
 
Follow the story as you gain experience and level 
up your MedaBot's medal to gain more powerful 
attacks, better aim, etc.  Get more bodies and 
medals for MedaBots so you can battle with up to 
3-on-3 battles.

Medal of Honor - Infiltrator (c) Nov 17, 2003 
Netherock Ltd. / Electronic Arts GmbH 
 
Medal of Honor Infiltrator is a shooter from a 
top-down viewpoint. The top-down graphics and 
gameplay are reminiscent of classic games like 
Commando and Frontline. 
 
In its 15 total levels, Infiltrator brings 
together a variety of different play styles that 
should be familiar to anyone who's played their 
fair share of 8- and 16-bit games. 
 
You can hide behind houses and other buildings to 
stop enemy bullets. 
If you come across a stationary gun or a tank 
sitting in a level, you can put these weapons to 
use against the enemy. 
 
Each level has a number of mission objectives 
assigned to it, such as locating documents or 
destroying ammunition depots. To complete a level, 
you need to accomplish these goals. 
 
The difficulty level is, like its forerunners, 
high and urges the players all the time.

Lan, Chaud, Dex and other characters from the Mega

in the Battle Chip GP!  Take control of your 
favorite character and face off against many 
opponents as you make your way to the head of the 
GP to reach the ultimate prize, an incredibly rare 
battle chip! 
 
Gameplay is based around the Mega Man Battle 
Network series of games, in that players purchase 
and use various battle chips to combat their 
opponents.  However, unlike the main games, 
players do not have direct control over their Net 
Navi.  Instead, players pre-select their battle 
chips, and one of these chips are used in the 
battle against the opponent.  Once selected, the 
game automatically plays out the battle. 
 
There is also a process called 'slotting in', 
which can be performed by pressing L or R during 
battle when your slot in gauge is full.  Slotting 
in allows you to use an additional battle chip 
during gameplay to assist you.  If successful, the 
chip will be used, and aid you with healing, 
dealing extra damage, and so on.

It's been rather quiet after Lan and Mega Man 
defeated the WWW in Mega Man Battle Network 3.  
Little do they know that they're about to embark 
on yet another adventure.  An asteroid has been 
spotted in outer space which is heading towards 
Earth, and scientists are planning to destroy it 
with a giant laser.  In addition to this, a 
mysterious Navi called ShadeMan is terrorizing the 
Internet, sucking the life out of other Navis, 
much like a vampire.  Can Lan and Mega Man stop 
this new threat? 
 
Mega Man Battle Network 4 is an RPG-like game, and 
a continuation of the Battle Network series.  You 
play as two characters - a young boy, Lan, in the 
real world, and a Net Navi called Mega Man on the 
Internet.  Lan can talk to people and interact 
with the real world, however, when he 'jacks in' 
to the Internet, Mega Man takes over.  In addition 
to interacting with Navis on the net, Mega Man 
also encounters random viruses and battles them in 
a mix of turn-based and real-time battle. 
 
A new feature of Battle Network 4 is the "Soul 
Unison" feature - as players progress through the 
game, they can defeat certain Navis and earn the 
ability to merge with them to become more 
powerful.  The catch with this is that the Soul 
Unison only lasts for three turns, and that a 
particular Battle Chip is required to perform it. 
 
The Soul Unisons that you acquire through the game 
are specific to each version - to get them all, 
you must link up with a copy of Mega Man Battle 
Network 4: Red Sun.  You can also trade different 
Battle Chips (some are exclusive to particular 
versions) and Net Battle with a friend.

Lan and Mega Man return in the fifth entry to the 
Battle Network series of games.  In this sequel, a 
mysterious group is distributing Dark Navi chips 
in the hope of corrupting Navis worldwide.  Lan 
and his friends must storm the Dark Chip Factory 
and put a stop to this problem before it becomes 
any worse. 
 
The game uses an RPG style over-world in which Lan 
and Mega Man navigate and interact.  In the real 
world, you control Lan, and can interact with 
objects and talk to people.  When you need to 
enter cyberspace, you 'jack-in', and take control 
of Mega Man.  Mega Man must also battle viruses in 
addition to navigating through the internet.  This 
is done with a combination of action and 
turn-based battle, where you select powerful chips 
to give you an edge each turn, then use the chips 
and dodge shots in realtime. 
 
The game also features Liberation Missions, which 
are a more traditional turn-based style of play.  
In this mode, you must 'liberate' dark tiles on 
your way to confront the boss.  Liberation 
Missions play somewhat like a complicated game of 
chess, with the player actually fighting the 
battles between the pieces. 
 
Unique to this version of the game is the ability 
to play as Colonel partway through the story. The 
game can also link up to Mega Man Battle Network 
5: Team Protoman to trade and complete your battle 
chip collection - certain chips are only available 
in one version of the game.

Megaman Battle Network 6 - Cybeast Falzar (c) Jun 
13, 2006 Capcom Production Studio 2 / Capcom 
U.S.A., Inc. 
 
Lan and his family have moved house to Cyber City, 
which is famous for its new technology.  Lan and 
Mega Man quickly make new friends, and find out 
about the legend of the Cybeasts, two ancient 
creatures with such power that they eventually 
destroyed each other.  However, a shady 
organization is intent on reviving and controlling 
the Cybeasts for their own nefarious needs, and 
Mega Man gets caught in the middle!  While they 
capture the wolf-like Gregar, Mega Man captures 
the phoenix-like Falzar.  By harnessing this new 
power, Lan and Mega Man must save the internet 
once again! 
 
Mega Man Battle Network 6 is an RPG-like game in 
which you navigate through both the real world, 
and the cyberworld of the internet.  As Lan, you 
move through the real world, interacting with 
people and finding places to 'jack-in' to the 
cyberworld for Mega Man to take control.  As Mega 
Man, you can fight viruses in a hybrid of 
turn-based and real-time battle: you select which 
battle chips you need to use each turn, and then 
use them while actively dodging enemy fire. 
 
New to Battle Network 6 is the "Cross Change" 
system.  After beating certain enemy Navis, Mega 
Man can copy their strengths (as well as their 
weaknesses!) and use them to his advantage, 
similar to the original Mega Man games.  For 
example, you could take on the aqua power of Aqua 
Man, or the cutting power of Tomahawk Man. 
 
At a certain point in the game, Mega Man also 
gains control of the powerful Cybeast, Falzar.  
Using this power, Mega Man can transform into a 
phoenix-like Navi, boosting his attack power for 
three turns, and enhance the power of certain 
battle chips.  If players continue to push Mega 
Man, he will enter the "Beast Over" state, with 
even more power, but at the loss of control and a 
severely weakened Mega Man.  It's also possible to 
combine the Cross Change with Falzar, creating 
even more powerful attacks. 
 
This game also links up to Mega Man Battle Network 
6: Cybeast Gregar.  Players can trade battle chips 
that are specific to each version, or net battle 
against each other.

It is the year 22XX... 
 
The legendary heroes of the Reploids, X and Zero, 
defeated the evil Sigma long ago, and a new army 
was created to prevent outbreaks of the Maverick 
Virus. But as time went on, the army became 
oppressive, and began to deal out a paranoid brand 
of justice. It is said that their leader, once a 
great warrior, has become cold and calculating, 
eliminating any Reploid that dares oppose him. 
 
A hero is needed in these dark times, and that is 
exactly what Ciel and her rebel group have found 
in an old ruin...a hero from the past, reborn in 
the future. 
 
Zero has come into a time he does not know, to 
save it from a figure of the past...the fate of 
freedom rests on his shoulders.

Continuing where the Mega Man Zero 2 left off, you 
have to find and neutralize the recently escaped 
"Dark Elf," before it's able to brainwash the 
Resistance for the purpose of conquering Neo 
Arcadia. 
 
In addition to the old Cyber Elf system, this game 
also contains a new "chip" system, where Zero can 
gain new abilities by finding chips and installing 
chip in himself. But they didn't decide to abandon 
the Cyber Elves in this game by giving them 
nothing new. No, in order to extend the life of 
the Cyber Elves, they added the new concept of 
"Cyber Space" to levels, where you enter a door to 
Cyber Space and are allowed to use each Cyber Elf 
as much as you please without them dying. However, 
there aren't too many "Secret Disks" (items that 
can contain anything from profiles of characters 
to Cyber Elves to new chips) in Cyber Space, so 
it's better to spend more time in the normal 
level.

In the future, the Galactic Federation and the

stolen an unknown life-form, recently discovered 
on the planet SR388. The life-form, designated 
"Metroid", is in a state of suspended animation

complete destruction of SR388. If the Metroid ever 
got loose, the alien could destroy countless other 
systems. It is up to the space bounty hunter Samus 
Aran to land on Zebes and find her way through the 
perilous terrains of Brinstar and Norfair, destroy 
the Pirates, as well as their alien enforcers, 
Ridley and Kraid, and rid the planet of the alien 
life form before the pirates complete their plans 
of world destruction. 
 
Using the cybernetic enhancements of her Power 
Suit, Samus can use a range of weapons and 
defenses to destroy the enemy. She can also absorb 
enemies powers into her Power Suit to increase her 
defense and chance of survival. Using her weapons 
and special abilities, she must find her way to 
the central chamber of Tourian and destroy the 
Mother Brain, the mysterious leader behind the 
Space Pirates.

rocks the Biologic Space Labs. Now Samus must 
investigate the Space Labs, which are orbiting 
SR388. 
 
This game is similar, in terms of gameplay and 
structure, to the classic side-scrolling Metroid 
games. The game consists of a large 
inter-connected environment. As Samus learns a 
variety of new moves and weapons, she is able to 
explore new areas of the Space Lab and unlock the 
secrets of the X parasite.

Metroid - Zero Mission (c) Feb 09, 2004 Nintendo 
R&D1 / Nintendo of America Inc. 
 
Pirates have stolen an unknown life-form, recently 
discovered on the planet SR388. The life-form, 
called Metroid, is in a state of suspended 
animation and, according to analysis, was the 
cause of the complete destruction of SR388. If it 
ever got loose, the alien could destroy countless 
other systems. 
 
The pirates have taken the being to the planet 
Zebes and are fending off the Galactic 
Federation's attacks. It is up to the space bounty 
hunter Samus Aran to find her way into the 
planet's core, destroy the pirates, and take back 
the alien before the pirates complete their plans 
of world destruction. 
 
Zero Mission takes Samus back to her first battle 
with Mother Brain, expanding on the original story 
line and action from the original Nintendo 
classic, Metroid, with updated visuals, new 
puzzles to solve, and cut scenes filling in the 
personal story of Samus. 
 
The player can perform moves taken from the 
original game, along with additions taken from the 
last GBA mission, Metroid Fusion, including the 
power grab. This game can also be linked to 
Metroid Fusion to unlock special extras.

Software, Inc. 
 
Underground street arcade style racing at night in 
New York City and London.  You are a cabbie, bored 
and looking for action.  When you stumble across 
your first challenger and are invited to join 
Midnight Club.  Call other members on your cell 
phone and challenge them to race across the city.  
Winner gets the losers car. 
 
Most challengers have a better set of wheels than 
you do so strategy and cunning play a key role if 
you are going to move up the ladder.  Both 
Manhattan and London are accurately modeled.  Race 
through Madison Square Garden.  Jump on to the 
deck of the Intrepid.  Barrel down the West Side 
Highway through Battery Park City and up F.D.R. 
 
In addition to career mode, you can play in 
Capture the Flag or just plain race in multiplayer 
mode.  Angel used the Smuggler's Run engine so the 
game play, feel and mechanics are very similar.

M&M's - Break' Em (V1.1) (c) 2007 Frame Studios 
Interactive / Destination Software, Inc. 
 
Mr. Runch is a rotten and dangerous peanut 
    that has escaped the reject bin. Burning with 
    revenge and sworn to become a real M&M peanut, 
    he is now on the loose and plans to kidnap all 
    M&M's to lock them up in a crystal. Five M&M 
    heroes - Red, Yellow, Blue, Green and Orange - 
    need to stop him. 
 
M&M's Break' Em is mainly a reworking of Gem 
Smashers, an earlier game by Frame Studios 
Interactive. The main story mode takes place on 
different locations, gradually unlocked, along 
with boss battles. Keys can also unlock hidden 
levels, marked by a pink spot on the map. 
 
The player controls one of the M&M's and bounces 
it throughout the screen. They have different 
characteristics such based on speed, power and 
boost. It needs to hit crystals of the same colour 
(pinballing vertically off objects) and special 
pots are used to change the colour. When all 
crystals are gone, the level is completed. 
Gameplay is time limited, crossing it makes a 
bouncing skull appear on the screen taking away 
lives. Special blocks contain bonuses such as 
detonators, extra points, invulnerability, score 
multipliers and a harder M&M that cuts through all 
crystals. The M&M can be moved left or right 
horizontally, and sped up or slowed down. 
 
Skills slightly influence gameplay. High power 
requires less hits to break hard rocks, while 
boost allows the character to speed up. Only 
Yellow and Green can break special blocks to 
access bonuses. 
 
The DS version can be controlled with the stylus 
and contains a multiplayer mode.

mecha drama, contrary to super robot series. 
 
The game includes both first-person shooting and 
side-scrolling elements of gameplay, the platform 
portions obviously inspired by the past year's 
hit, Thexder. It allows you to play as the Zeta 
Gundam, who can also transform into the 
wave-rider. The enemies consist of many different 
mobile suits from the show, including the Hizack,

Monster Bass Fishing (c) Jun 22, 2002 Ignition 
Entertainment Ltd. / AIA USA, Ltd. 
 
Although the name implies you're going to catch 
monsters, Monster! Bass Fishing is a normal 
fishing game where you can catch a variety of fish 
including various bass, northern pike, catfish, 
and more.  The "monster" part is that you get 
bonus points for catching monster-sized fish. 
 
The game is played in one of two modes, Challenge 
or Free Fish.  In Free Fish, you can fish in any 
location that is unlocked for as long as you like. 
 In Challenge, you are competing in a tournament 
and will have a time limit and a specific location 
to fish at. 
 
When you start at a location in either mode, you 
have the option to move your boat to any place on 
the map.  However, this does take time and may not 
always be in your best interest in the Challenge 
mode.  You can then either start casting, or you 
can change your lure first. 
 
Catching fish is really just a matter of using a 
good lure and tempting movements.  When a fish 
strikes, you need to keep enough pressure on the 
line to keep the hook set, or the fish will get 
away.  If you let the line get too tight, the line 
will break and you'll lose the fish then as well.  
Now just reel it in and see what you caught. 
 
The GUI shows a nice fish finder that is 
color-coded by the type of fish that is seen.  
Note that this finder is not always accurate. 
 
Statistics for the game are very nice.  You can 
see a nice picture of your fish that you catch 
along with the size of it.  The top 6 can then be 
saved in the Aquarium for viewing at any time.  
Your tournament scores will be based on weight of 
fish and any monster bonuses (bonuses for catching 
one of the top 3 largest fish that round).  
Winning the tournaments will unlock new locations 
and let you progress to a new location for the 
next tournament.  It will also get you a nice 
trophy.

Monster Rancher Advanced (c) Nov 29, 2001 Tecmo, 
Ltd. / Tecmo, Inc. 
 
Monster Rancher Advance is a monster raising sim 
that allows players to raise and customize 440 
monster types. These monsters can then be tested 
in in-game tournaments, or battled against other 
players in 2P mode with the GBA link cable. 
 
Monsters are created in the game's shrine through 
the entry of letters, numbers and punctuation 
symbols. Players begin with the ability to enter 
up to 4 characters to make monsters, and can 
unlock the ability to use up to 8 characters 
through gaining higher trainer ranks. Different 
words or combinations of characters can not only 
make different types of monsters, but each monster 
can have varying attributes and characteristics, 
making each one unique. 
 
Players then train the monsters by choosing  which 
foods to feed, which drills to do to raise 
attributes, what training to send them to for new 
attacks, and what items to give them. The game 
starts with a modest amount of money with which 
food and items can be purchased, more money is 
earned in tournaments. Gameplay revolves around 
planning training sessions, adding new attacks and 
juggling a bank account, along with attempting to 
win tournaments. As monsters age, they can be 
added to a coaching staff to help raise new 
monsters to better attributes, or they can be 
combined with other monsters to make stronger 
babies. Monsters do not die in this game, however, 
they do face an enforced retirement age. 
 
There is a fairly straightforward storyline, where 
some characters from older Monster Rancher games 
visit, and new characters are introduced. The 
gameplay itself, like most other Monster Rancher 
games, is open-ended and has unlimited replay 
value. 
 
The 2 Player mode, involving a link cable and two 
copies of the game, allows players to test the 
monsters they have raised against other players. 
The 2P mode also allows players to trade items and 
cash with one another, to wager items or cash on 
tournaments, and trade raised monsters into each 
others' games.

Monster Rancher Advanced 2 (c) Nov 18, 2002 
Graphic Research Co., Ltd.|Tecmo, Ltd. / Tecmo, 
Inc. 
 
Monster Rancher Advance 2 is a monster raising sim 
where players can raise, battle, explore with any 
of 512 monsters. While it is the second Monster 
Rancher game on the Game Boy Advance system, it is 
not a true sequel, and does not require any 
knowledge of any other ranching games to play. 
 
Players make monsters by entering letters, 
numbers, and punctuation characters into the 
in-game shrine. At the start, players have access 
to up to 4 spaces to enter words or characters. As 
they improve their rank as a trainer, they can 
access more spaces, up to a maximum of 8. Players 
may also bring monsters into the game from their 
Monster Rancher Advance game, or trade monsters 
with other Monster Rancher Advance 2 players 
through use of a second GBA and a link cable. 
 
Players then raise their monster, deciding what 
foods to feed them, what drills to teach 
attributes at, what items to give them, what 
attacks to add in training, and which 
characteristics to add or remove at the Hospital. 
Monsters may become hurt or ill, and can be 
treated for a fee at the Hospital which also 
offers free checkups. Players start with a modest 
sum of money, and earn more by winning in-game 
tournaments, or by finding valuable items to sell 
on expeditions. 
 
The storyline is one of the longest and most 
complex of any Monster Rancher game. Unlocking 
various types of monsters involves participating 
in a variety of events including storyline quests 
on expeditions, and battling in various 
tournaments. Players will see characters from 
older Monster Rancher games, and be introduced to 
new characters. Monsters now develop bonds with 
each other and can become friends with monsters 
within the game, and with monsters in other 
player's games via link cable use. Completing the 
storyline requires over 200 hours of gameplay. 
 
Monsters do not die in this game, but they do face 
an enforced retirement age. When retired, they can 
coach other monsters to improve drills, and be 
used in combining to make stronger baby monsters 
with more attacks and better characteristics. 
 
This game has several improvements over the 
previous Game Boy Advance game including: a 
counter system added to battles, RPG style 
expeditions, a monster buddy system, a more 
complex coaching for pay system, super coaches, 
the ability to add or remove characteristics, 
diseases, tag team battles, more hidden monsters, 
and a new breed of monster. 
 
In 2 Player mode, monsters can battle against 
other player's monsters via the GBA link cable. 
Single monsters can face off against each other, 
or players can set up tag team battles.

Moorhen 3 ...Chicken Chase is a shooter still in 
the same style as the first Moohrhuhn. The player 
has a gun and he shoots chickens which fly over 
the screen. If they are far away, they give more 
points. After six shots the player has to reload 
the weapon (which gives a time penalty). The time 
is limited, the screen can be scrolled left and 
right and the ultimate goal is to improve the own 
highscore. 
 
In this game the only background is set at a sea. 
New features are more different animals to shoot, 
including the "Lesshühner" which give negative 
points. Two new ammo types are more powerful but 
limited and have to be earned by shooting certain 
things. There are multiple hidden extras to find, 
e.g. ways to extend the playing time. In the PC 
version there is an online highscore list.

PocketNES V9.98 - Motocross Champion (c) Apr 18, 
2007 DHG games / DHG games 
 
Motocross Challenge is a 2D side-scrolling 
motorcycle game combining regular racing and 
tricks. The game can only be played through an 
emulator or a GBA flashcard but is not strictly 
homebrew. It is a game made by a commercial 
developer, but when the project was cancelled by 
two publishers, they decided to release the game 
for free. The game can also be ordered on a 
cartridge from the developer's website. In 2010 it 
was followed up with an iPhone/iPad release. 
 
The tracks remind of Excitebike while the gameplay 
seems inspired by Motocross Maniacs. The game 
offers two main modes: Free Ride (choose an 
unlocked bike and track to practise) and 
Challenge. The Challenge mode involves a series of 
events in 3 major categories: Beat the Clock 
(time-based), Trick Attack (points-based) and 
World Tour (race against 3 AI opponents). When all 
courses are finished, the final event, MXC 
Championship, is unlocked. The events are divided 
over different trees and completing certain 
courses unlocks new tracks or one of the 8 
available bikes. The bikes have different 
statistics based on speed, handling, acceleration, 
height, boost and suspension. 
 
Gameplay involves a fair amount of physics. When 
the bike accelerates, the front wheel leaves the 
ground and this needs to be compensated by nudging 
the d-pad. Up and down on the d-pad is used to 
switch lanes. Many tricks (activated through the 
L-button) involve balance and constant correcting 
is needed. Next to accelerating, braking and 
tricks, there is a button for boost. Only a 
limited amount is offered, but it constantly 
regenerates at a slow rate. It is used to gain 
extra speed, especially before big jumps to gain 
extra air time. The full amount of boost should 
never be used or let maxed out, as too little or 
too much slows the bike down. While in the air, 
using a combination of the L-button and the d-pad, 
players can perform tricks such as superman, 
nac-nac of backflip. By completing Trick Attack 
events, new tricks can be unlocked. 
 
There are different types of tracks, set on a 
beach, an arena, downtown, in the snow, in a 
forest, in a desert and even a dump. They contain 
a series of jumps but also areas that slow down 
the bike, along with obstacles. The game screen 
shows the current position of the player (in World 
Tour), the current location on the track along 
with the finish, the time (remaining time in Beat 
the Clock), the current lap (in World Tour), the 
boost meter and the amount of points for a trick, 
and the remaining trick points needed (in Trick 
Attack). The game supports passwords to save and 
restore the player's progress.

You play the game as Susumu or Anna. Equipped with 
nothing but a pressurized suit and a drill, you 
need to contact the King of the Undergrounders. To 
do this, you will need to drill down several 
thousands of feet avoiding being crushed and 
remembering to pick up air tanks.This is a 
real-time puzzle game where you will be 
continually moving down or sideways in an effort 
to get to the bottom. As you dig, blocks will fall 
to fill in the spaces below. Like colored blocks 
will stick together (giving you time to rest), but 
will disappear if 4 or more blocks come together. 
This can cause chain reactions (very common in 
two-color levels) that become dangerous 
quickly.Three modes of play: Story, Time Attack, 
and Endless Driller. Story Mode uses the bare 
bones story from above. Time Attack gives you a 
set levels with a specific time limit. Endless 
Driller allows you to dig for as long as you can.

MX 2002 featuring Ricky Carmichael is a motocross 
game which features two basic modes of play. One 
of motocross racing in which players have the 
standard practice/single race/season options with 
ongoing success unlocking more tracks and bikes. 
The other mode is a stunt-based motocross 
practice/competition mode where riders try to do 
as many crazy tricks in a crowd filled arena as 
possible within a particular amount of time. The 
game has a unique feature in that the bike has a 
controllable clutch (even for automatic gears) 
which must be mastered to succeed at the game. 
Correct use of the clutch when landing jumps of 
traversing troublesome terrain allows the rider's 
speed to be kept at a maximum. This must be used 
in conjunction with the "Prime Jump" button which 
must be held before a jump or bump to fly through 
the air.

In this third game starring Nancy Drew, the famous 
teen detective has to solve a mystery in a 
Victorian mansion in San Francisco. The villa 
seems to be inhabited by ghosts... but this is not 
all. Somewhere in this strange house lies a 
treasure. That's why she's not the only one 
interested in this mansion. Could it be the 
antique dealer, the handy-man, the retired 
teacher, the owner of the estate or someone else? 
Everyone has something to hide and Nancy must find 
out who is behind the strange happenings going on. 
 
The game is a standard point-and-click adventure 
game that includes two difficulty choices (Junior 
and Senior Detective) and a Second Chance is 
offered to players who make a fatal mistake. There 
are a large number of puzzles to be solved, some 
of which are slightly different depending upon the 
difficulty level chosen. Setting the time of day 
in Nancy's bedroom is necessary for certain events 
to occur or the availability of some in-game 
characters. 
 
Compared to the previous Nancy Drew games, Message 
In The Haunted Mansion underwent big changes in 
design. It is 360 degree with full motion freedom.

Naruto - Ninja Council (c) Mar, 2006 Tomy / Tomy 
 
Naruto: Ninja Council is another game that was 
taken from a famous Japanese anime series and is 
also the first installment of the Ninja Council 
series. 
 
It's a side scrolling, action oriented game with 
two modes to choose - Story mode and Free mode - 
and two playable characters. The story of Ninja 
Council starts from the survival exam and ends 
with Orochimaru’s attack at the Hidden Konoha 
Village. Apart from that there are no actual 
events between that - that take place on the anime 
although there are fights with certain characters 
that do like the fight with Haku and Orochimaru. 
 
The characters that are available are Naruto and 
Sasuke. When you start a new game at the beginning 
of each stage Kakashi sensei appears to give you 
hints about the controls and other useful staff 
like a boss’ weak point or attack patterns. There 
are also hidden characters you can find who can 
restore your health when you run out of life. 
Stages have a time limit of 5 minutes to complete. 
At the end of each stage there is a boss fight and 
the timer resets at 5 minutes in which you have to 
win the battle in order to advance the game and be 
able to save your progress. 
 
The two available characters - Naruto and Sasuke - 
can both use the same combo hits and weapons that 
can be picked up in each stage like shuriken and 
kunai. Every second stage the player will also 
find scrolls that contain elemental power ups like 
the Lightning Style Scroll that can be used either 
for attacking opponents or for progressing in the 
game. Apart from that each one has a set of three 
unique special attacks that can be used but only 
if you have sufficient amount of chakra.

Naruto - Ninja Council 2 (c) Oct 10, 2006 Aspect 
Co. Ltd. / D3Publisher of America, Inc.|Tomy 
 
This is the second Naruto title for the Ninja 
Council series and follows the adventures of 
Naruto, Sasuke and Sakura as they try to pass the 
Chunin Exam in a total of seven stages. 
 
Unlike the first title you can now control three 
characters by changing them anytime you want 
inside the game. Each one has unique sequences of 
punches and kicks and can use 3 special techniques 
with varying results from one character to 
another. The shuriken, kunai and fuma from the 
first game are still here although this time one 
hit is enough to dispatch an enemy. Along the 
stages you can also find summoning scrolls and use 
them in fights to call Kakashi, Choji and others 
to attack the enemies. Another addition to the 
gameplay is the Teleport move which as the name 
implies allows you to teleport near or behind an 
enemy to attack him or simply dodge his attacks. 
At parts of each stage you may be given certain 
objectives such as to defeat all the enemies or 
finish the stage within a time limit and 
parameters like the use of only one character. At 
the end of each stage you get a grade depending on 
how many enemies you killed, how fast you finished 
the stage, how many characters you are left and 
how many leaves you have collected. At the end of 
the game these grades will be accumulated to 
decide your final rank. 
 
The game also features two additional modes – the 
Co-op Mode and the Vs. Mode but you need the link 
cable for that.

Famicom Mini - Vol. 22 - Nazo no Murasamejou (c) 
Aug 10, 2004 Nintendo EAD / Nintendo Co., Ltd. 
 
In feudal Japan, an evil alien descends upon 
Murasame castle and takes over a giant statue, 
which then continues to spread its influence over 
four neighbouring castles. The samurai apprentice 
Takamaru is thus summoned to recapture the castles 
and then take on the alien itself. 
 
Nazo no Murasamejou is a fast-paced action game 
that has some similarities with The Legend of 
Zelda, although it is faster and has none of the 
RPG/Adventure elements. It is also much more 
linear: You fight through the castles one after 
the other, with each stage consisting of the path 
to the castle and the castle itself, where the 
boss is waiting. 
 
Your have two weapons: (unlimited) shurikens for 
ranged attacks and a sword for melee combat. The 
sword is automatically used when you are close 
enough to an enemy, and it can also be used to 
deflect enemy shurikens. But since you are 
constantly under attack by ninjas from all 
directions and also have only a limited time to 
finish each stage, the game is still quite hard.

racing fellow drivers, you will make your way up 
to Ace Test Driver. Second, there's Evolution, 
which is the "career mode", you start with enough 
money to buy one 356, and start racing. As you win 
races, time will pass, new cars will become 
available, or you can peruse the used car market. 
Buy/repair/sell cars, win races, buy enhancement 
parts for your car, and make your way to the end 
of the modern era... 
 
You can also play online via EARacing.com, where 
you can pick customized cars in your Evolution 
stable or choose stock cars and race up to 7 other 
cars simultaneously. 
 
The graphics have been enhanced and the physics 
model changed to reflect a true 4-point system, 
and you can feel the difference between the 
different vehicles.

NFL Blitz 2002 (c) Feb 07, 2002 Midway Games, Inc. 
/ Midway Games, Inc. 
 
The NFL Blitz 20-02 incarnation promises deeper 
gameplay, more animations, better AI, more 
mini-games, and even harder hits. Still focusing 
on its roots of hard-hitting football action with 
no rules whatsoever, the game hopes to hit the 
consoles as hard as its players hit each other.

NHL 2002 (c) Mar 06, 2002 Budcat Creations, LLC / 
Electronic Arts, Inc. 
 
NHL 2002 is the only entry in Electronic Arts' 
hockey series to be released on the Game Boy 
Advance. With the console versions having migrated 
to 3D graphics years earlier, the handheld game 
retains a 2D top-down view very similar to the 
earliest titles in the series on the Genesis and 
SNES. 
 
Besides a standard mode for exhibition games, the 
game has a practice mode where the number of 
players on the field can be freely chosen. Season 
mode is unusual in that, unlike in other games, 
the player doesn't select a team to lead through a 
season. Instead, the game includes the full game 
schedule of the 2001-2002 NHL season, and any team 
in any scheduled game can be played. If no games 
of interest are scheduled on a given day, it can 
be skipped and the results simulated. The season 
mode also includes the ability to trade players, 
sign free agents and even to create players. 
 
The game also includes a multi player mode over 
the link cable, with up to four players able to 
join for cooperative or competitive play.

NHL Hitz 2003 (c) Oct 14, 2002 Exient 
Entertainment / Midway Home Entertainment, Inc. 
 
This game uses the same three-on-three style that 
debuted in Hitz 2002.  The 2003 installment has 
larger rinks, bigger crowds, a referee, and 
animated coaches.  All 30 NHL teams are 
represented with motion-capture animation, and you 
can build your own players with the Create-Player 
option. The game's Season mode now allows for 
trades, stat tracking, and player awards. 
 
Up to four players can play each other in 
exhibition mode. Season mode puts you into a 
standard NHL schedule, but you can change to a 
shorter season if you want. There is also a small 
numer of hockey-related minigames, such as 
keep-away. Franchise mode is where you pick and 
name your team, name your players, and play 
against other teams to earn experience points. 
Those points can be used to upgrade your players 
in categories such as toughness, speed, passing, 
and agility. After beating all the lesser teams in 
a tier, you can move on to battle a "boss team" 
for that region. Beating that team nets you some 
new equipment for your players, which also 
improves their stats.

You control a zubat as it collects food in the 
night. The goal is to collect as much food as 
possible before running into a noxious koffing, 
the bane of flying pokémon it seems. What makes 
things sticky is that as it's so dark you can't 
see them! You are a bat though and will be able to 
use echolocation. Using "supersonic" you'll shoot 
sound waves forward that will let you see upcoming 
obstacles. 
 
The game scrolls to the left allowing you to fly 
around the screen that is available. The d-pad 
allows you to move around the screen and the A/B 
button will activate your "supersonic" attack. 
 
The game can be accessed by scanning the long 
dot-code on the Pokemon-e Skyridge cards, Zubat 
(117/144) and Golbat (60/144). Or in Japan the 
Pokemon e-card expansion 2 cards, Zubat (1/88) and

No no no Puzzle Chailien (c) Jun 16, 2005 
Creatures, Inc.|Nintendo Co., Ltd. / Nintendo Co., 
Ltd. 
 
Nonono Puzzle Chairian is a set of three puzzle 
games in one cartridge, and is developed by 
Creatures of Pokémon fame.  A group of aliens 
travelling in space get sucked into a black hole, 
which makes all of their machines go haywire.  
Each puzzle game is based around one of their 
machines, but has the same basic mechanic - you 
control a cursor which can rotate a 2x2 square 
block either clockwise or anti-clockwise. 
 
The first (and most well-known) game has you 
fixing a microwave.  You must shift the food into 
the holes using the cursor before time runs out, 
and if you do so, the food is served.  Every five 
rounds, you get a difficult challenge where there 
is only a set path to move around. 
 
The second game has you guiding a little white 
blob with legs.  You cannot directly control him, 
but you can use your cursor to rotate paths in 
front of him to safely get him to the finish line. 
 You can also make him run by holding the R 
Button. 
 
The final, and most in-depth game, shows an 8x8 
grid of coloured number blocks, from three to six. 
 Line up three 'threes', and they turn into fours, 
line up four 'fours', and they turn into fives, 
line up five 'fives', and they turn into sixes, 
and line  up six 'sixes', and they disappear.  You 
can line the blocks up either horizontally or 
vertically, but not diagonally.  You can also move 
other blocks around while numbers are changing to 
set off massive combos.

your own advantage. Abe's people can also lend a 
helping hand in fighting off creatures or solving 
puzzles, while you guide them away from danger. 
Munch can also control Fuzzles, small critters

Onimusha Tactics (c) Nov 12, 2003 Capcom Co., Ltd. 
/ Capcom Co., Ltd. 
 
Young warrior, Onimaru is given the Oni Gauntlet 
as he rushes to defend his village from the demon 
hordes of Nobunaga Oda. Onimaru soon discovers 
from the old man Sandayu, that although he has 
been living in the peaceful province of Iga, he is 
of the Oni clan and had been secreted away. 
Additionally, with the power of the Oni Gauntlet, 
he can absorb the souls of enemies and use the 
demon Genma stones to recreate lost weapons and 
armor. With this new knowledge of who his is and 
of his destiny, he assembles a hasty squad of 
fighters including his sister Ororo and sets off 
to avenge his province and stop Nobunaga's demonic 
war upon the land. 
 
Onimusha Tactics is a turn-based strategy game 
between the player's side and the enemy's side. In 
each level you can bring a squad of no more than 
10 people. There are no items to buy or sell, 
however equipment is available and customizable. 
Upgrades of existing weapons and armor can be done 
using the defeated souls of enemies absorbed into 
the Oni Gauntlet. New weapons and armor can be 
found or created through fusion of Genma Stones. 
Recipes must be found for each separate item 
before it can be fused. 
 
Most characters have a normal attack, the ability 
to use items and several special techniques for 
battle. Additionally there is an issen ability 
that randomly shows up and allows your character 
to counter-attack and instantly kill any enemy who 
foolishly attacks that character directly in the 
next round.

Open Season (c) Sep 19, 2006 Ubisoft 
Divertissements Inc. / Ubisoft, Inc. 
 
Open Season for GBA is based on the movie and it 
is a completely different game experience than the 
console version. The story in the game follows the 
movie pretty well and it is well presented through 
in-game and comic dialog style cinematics. It's 
about a Grizzly bear named Boog who is very happy 
with his domesticated home. But one day he gets in 
trouble with his new friend Elliot and the town's 
authority decides to put them back in the woods 
where they belong. Unfortunately, for them, the 
hunting season has just begun and Boog has no idea 
how to survive outside of his garage home with his 
beloved caretaker, Beth. 
 
The game begins just before Boog and Elliot are 
dropped in the woods. You control Boog and he has 
many cool moves. He can jump, roll, grab and throw 
forest animals as well as roar. The goal of the 
game is to protect the forest animals from the 
hunters. The forest is full of hunters and boss 
hunters in each animal territory. It is your job 
to clean up the forest so play it wild and rally 
an army of forest critters in a hilarious quest to 
scare off the hunters!

Bit Generations Orbital (c) Jul 27, 2006 Skip, 
Ltd. / Nintendo Co., Ltd. 
 
Take control of a small moon and consume all in 
your path!  Orbital is an action game where you 
pilot a moon in outer space.  Your goal is to have 
the sun orbiting around your small planet.  Before 
you can do that, however, you'll need to become 
big enough.  You can increase the size of your 
moon by engulfing planets and satellites that are 
smaller than your own.  If you try to run into 
anything larger than yourself (or the sun), you'll 
crash and lose a life.  Once you've reached a 
large enough size, the sun will turn yellow, and 
you'll be able to collect it by navigating close 
enough to it to snare it in your moon's orbit. 
 
Control for Orbital is very simple.  By pressing 
the A Button, you'll attract to the nearest 
planet.  By pressing the B Button, you'll repel 
away from it.  By using a combination of these 
simple controls, you'll be able to weave in and 
out of other planets, dodging the dangerous ones 
and collecting the smaller ones.  You can also 
collect smaller planets around your own as 
satellites for bonus points.  To do this, you must 
navigate close enough to the planet to attract it, 
but not run into it.  You can also collect the 
bonus moon that appears in this manner for a 
special bonus.

Oriental Blue - Ao no Tengai (c) Oct 24, 2003 
Hudson Soft Company, Ltd.|Red Company Corporation 
/ Bandai Co., Ltd. 
 
The game continues the tradition of Tengai Makyou 
series, also known as "Far East of Eden". You play 
as either Tenran or Aoi, a teenage boy and girl, 
respectively, on quest to defeat the ancient evil 
that threatens the prosperous land of Jipang, to 
prove themselves worthy of the legendary Fire 
Clan, warriors who have been protecting Jipang for 
many generations from evil demons and warlocks. 
The land Jipang is very similar to medieval Japan, 
and during your adventure you'll also visit 
Mongolia, China, and other Asian countries. 
 
The most important new feature of the game is a 
non-linear storyline. You can tackle many missions 
in any order you want, and the storyline also 
changes depending on the outcome of major battles. 
If you lose against a boss enemy, the game is not 
over, but instead, a branching storyline path is 
revealed. Otherwise, the gameplay is similar to 
other Tengai Makyou games, featuring overworld map 
traveling and first person perspective, turn-based 
combat.

The game consists of two tables, "city" and

perspective like in Pinball Dreams. There are no 
options available, like changing the number of 
balls for example. 
 
Apart from using Waalkes' characters, some of the 
sound effects are samples from Waalkes' shows and

You play Lester, a young physics professor, who 
suddenly finds himself in a strange alien world 
after a lightning struck during his particle 
experiment. Now he must fight for his life, first 
with his bare hands, then with a gun he finds. But 
what gives him courage is that he is not alone. 
One of the aliens, who together with him escapes 
from the prison, helps him on his dangerous quest. 
Friendship can overcome all the obstacles. 
 
Out of This World is an action adventure game, 
where the adventuring element is concealed behind 
what looks like a typical platform shooter. The 
gameplay is based mainly on physical and 
environmental puzzles. There is no on-screen 
interface, and no in-game dialogue. Each enemy 
requires a different strategy, and often there is 
only one way to solve the problem. Typically, 
enemies will be defeated through the use of a gun 
you find near the beginning of the game

Classic NES Series - Pac-Man (c) Jun 07, 2004 
Namco Limited / Nintendo of America Inc. 
 
One of the most popular and influential games of 
the 1980's, Pac-Man stars a little, yellow 
dot-muncher who works his way around to clear a 
maze of the various dots and fruit which inhabit 
the board. 
 
Pac-Man's goal is continually challenged by 
   four ghosts: The shy blue ghost Bashful (Inky), 
   the trailing red ghost Shadow (Blinky), the 
   fast pink ghost Speedy (Pinky), and the 
   forgetful orange ghost Pokey (Clyde).  One 
   touch from any of these ghosts means a loss of 
   life for Pac-Man. 
 
Pac-Man can turn the tables on his pursuers by 
   eating of the four Energizers located within 
   the maze.  During this time, the ghosts turn 
   blue, and Pac-Man can eat them for bonus 
   points.  This only lasts for a limited amount 
   of time, as the ghost's eyes float back to 
   their center box, and regenerate to chase after 
   Pac-Man again. 
 
Survive a few rounds of gameplay, and be treated 
to humorous intermissions between Pac-Man and the 
ghosts.

Pac-Man Collection (c) Jul 11, 2001 Mass Media,

Four classic Pac-Man games are included in this

1. Pac-Man: The original arcade classic, 
   complete and un-cut. 
2. Pac-Mania: A conversion of the 1987 update 
   to Pac-Man, which takes the elements of the 
   original arcade game and puts it into an 
   isometric view, as well as adding the ability 
   to jump. 
3. Pac-Man Arrangement: Never re-produced 
   outside of the arcade, Arrangement again uses 
   the elements of the original Pac-Man and adds a 
   fifth ghost, who can change shape and size when 
   combined with the other 4 ghosts, and make life 
   harder for Pac-Man. New power-ups are also 
   included, like the ability to dash quickly 
   around the screen, warp points to get from one 
   place to the other and new ways of catching 
   ghosts. 
Pac-Attack: Like Tetris before it, you must fit 
   falling blocks together to complete a line to 
   clear the screen. In this case, the falling 
   tiles also have ghosts in them, and once the 
   Pac-Man tile appears (a tile with the Pac-Man 
   symbol), Pac-Man will eat all of the ghosts 
   that are in his path until he gets to a dead 
   end.

will perform well in both agility and beauty 
competitions. 
Winning these, the owner will be able to buy even 
better pet care products for the loved one. 
Everything – health, looks, mood and performance 
of the animal – depends on the interaction between 
player and animal. 
Detailed and realistic animations of the cute

every day, and train it to raise the three 
statistics the game tracks, making the horse 
perform better in the equestrian sport disciplines

appearance to their own taste. 
 
The player can take his/her horse to rides in 
various country landscapes or be part of 
equestrian tournaments that will yield different 
rewards when successful. Furthermore, one can

Little Pichu and Togepi are jammin' to the tunes, 
but it's up to Pikachu to keep the music flowing. 
It seems that power is in short supply so Pikachu 
will have to use his electric powers to supply 
energy to the stereo and speakers. 
 
You'll move the electric rodent left and right and 
use A to jolt the audio equipment back to life. 
When the stereo or a speaker starts turning gray 
it's time to zap it, if you fail to do so it will 
explode. Once you lose a speaker fun's over and 
the two baby dancers will collapse. 
 
The game can be accessed by scanning the long

Pirates of the Caribbean 2: Dead Man’s Chest is a 
swashbuckling sidescroller for the Game Boy 
Advance, based on the movie of the same name. 
 
The game has two main modes of seafaring 
adventure. The first is an action sidescroller, 
where players take control of the infamous Captain 
Jack Sparrow as he tries to reclaim his soul back 
from Davy Jones. He'll run, jump, and battle 
cannibals, pirates, the royal navy, and Davy 
Jones' monstrous crew across 15 islands, each made 
up of several maps. 
 
Between the islands, players gets to captain 
Sparrow's ship, the Black Pearl. They'll need to 
equip her with food (otherwise the crew might 
mutiny!), cannons, and supplies enough to fend off 
privateers and pirates on the open sea. 
 
Radically different than versions of the same 
title on other platforms, the Game Boy Advance 
version gives players a lot of gameplay variety 
over the course of the game. The open-ended island 
exploration, ship-to-ship battles, and "RPG-lite" 
upgrade system means that players can play this 
game in many different ways.

Pokémon Emerald is the fifth Pokémon game of the 
advanced generation, after its predecessors Ruby, 
Sapphire, FireRed, and LeafGreen. It takes place 
in the world of Hoenn but can also connect with 
Kanto-based games FireRed and LeafGreen as well. 
Like Pikachu and Suicune were for Yellow and 
Crystal respectively, Rayquaza plays a vital role 
in this game along with the other Legendaries, 
Groudon and Kyogre. Though similar to the original 
storyline that occurs in Hoenn, Emerald offers 
more changes than Yellow and Crystal. 
 
In terms of gameplay, there have been several 
alterations to the game: 
 
Legendaries 
 
1. Ability to catch Rayquaza before the Elite 
   Four, as well as both Groudon and Kyogre after 
   it. 
2. Changes to catching the Regis. 
3. Ability to catch either one of Latios or 
   Latias. 
 
Graphics 
 
1. New outfits for the characters. 
4. New Pokémon animations. 
 
Features 
 
1. Ability to enter the Safari Zone Extension, 
   where you can catch Johto (the world of Pokémon 
   Gold, Silver and Crystal) Pokémon like Houndour 
   and Miltank. 
5. The Battle Frontier, an island full of 
   different battle stadiums. 
6. Ability to get both of the Claw and Root 
   fossils. 
 
These are of the changes you might notice at first 
while playing Pokémon Emerald. However, there are 
lots of other improvements apart from the new 
storyline that separates this game from its 
predecessors.

Your job is to not only use the Poke-ball as a 
pinball and rack up the biggest score on the 
table, but to also capture the Pokemon through a 
selection of mini-games and challenges during the 
usual pinball game. Simply hit the required areas 
of the board with the ball and you'll capture the 
monster available. There's 200 to find in total. 
 
Two different boards are on offer, each based on 
the two versions of Pokemon for GBA (i.e. Ruby and 
Sapphire). Each board represents a new challenge 
as well as which Pokemon you can catch during 
play. 
 
Although there is no 2 player battle mode of 
sorts, you can trade Pokemon and high scores using 
the link cable.

Polarium (c) Nov, 2006 Mitchell Corporation / 
Atlus U.S.A., Inc. 
 
Polarium Advance is basically the same as Polarium 
for the Nintendo DS, but a couple of new blocks 
have been added. 
 
This is a puzzle game in which the player must 
create horizontal lines of all the same color 
(either black or white). To change the color (or 
"polarity") of a block, you must select the blocks 
in one line. In most puzzles, you can use the 
border to lengthen the line. The new blocks in the 
Advance version are: Hurdle Tiles, which you 
cannot pass, Multi-Tiles, which count as black or 
white, and Solid Tiles, which will not turn but 
are removed so that the tiles above them fall 
down. There are 365 puzzles in this mode (Daily 
Polarium) ranging from very easy to quite 
challenging. 
 
The Time Attack Mode requires you to solve either 
ten easy puzzles or five hard puzzles within the 
time given. Leaving a block of the wrong color in 
a line results in a 30 seconds penalty. 
 
It is possible to create your own puzzles and 
share them with friends. Puzzles created in the 
Nintendo DS version of the game are compatible 
with the GBA version.

Power Pro Kun Pocket 3 (c) Mar 21, 2001 Diamond 
Head / Konami Corporation 
 
Power Pro Kun Pocket 3 is the third game in the 
long-running arcade baseball series for hand-helds 
and the first to appear on the Game Boy Advance. 
As a whole, it is part of the larger Jikkyo 
Powerful Pro Yakyu series also developed for the 
main console systems. 
 
The game includes a Success mode, where the 
baseball sequences are combined with a larger 
storyline introducing simulation and role-playing 
elements. Generally, the aim is to train a weak 
player to become one of the best, mixed with 
different intrigues. In this version, the player's 
character was once a famous high school baseball 
player who got killed. A doctor resurrected him as 
a robot and now he needs to go to three stages to 
regain his status. The first phase requires the 
character to get drafted with a team, in the 
second he needs to earn money to earn a life-long 
battery and the third and final phase requires 
acquiring a memory level of more than 80%. The 
character can go to his former high school and 
duel rivals in different mini-games. 
 
The player's character has HP, a stress bar and a 
memory bar, which are affected by various events. 
The player can do jobs to earn money and 
power-ups, restore health, date a girlfriend, 
train or mediate, suffer from illness or emotional 
trauma, and there is even an inventory with items 
and a screen with all the acquired abilities. 
 
Other modes are Exhibition, Arrange (create custom 
teams), Data and different mini-games. Playing 
against other people using a link cable is 
supported. The customization options are 
extensive, ranging from the amount of control the 
computer is given (hitting, pitching, running 
players, switching and fielding) to the different 
team and player statistics. Games consists of 
several innings where the player takes turns 
hitting and pitching. Most of the traditional game 
rules are followed.

Another day in the city of Townsville, and this 
time, the Powerpuff Girls are off on a scavenger 
hunt!  Ms. Keene has given the girls a list of 
different items that can be found in the city.  
Along the way, Blossom, Bubbles and Buttercup will 
run into familiar villains such as Mojo Jojo, 
Fuzzy Lumpkins, The Gangreen Gang, the Boogie Man, 
and of course... HIM. 
 
Him and Seek is a side-scrolling adventure game 
starring the Powerpuff Girls.  There's no 
platforming required in this game, as the girls 
can fly everywhere.  Instead, it plays like a 
combination of a beat-em-up and a point and click 
adventure game.  The girls will need to perform 
tasks for Townsville citizens to get items for 
their scavenger hunt list, ranging from destroying 
crazy monsters, to finding lost wallets, to 
beating up the Gangreen Gang to get a tooth! 
 
Initially, you can only control one girl at a 
time, attacking with punches and kicks, shooting 
laser beams, and dashing.  However, later the 
girls decide to team up, and you can switch girls 
on the fly by pressing the L Button.  There are 
also some cool mini-games, such as an excellent 
pinball machine, a Dance Dance Revolution-like 
dance-off against the Boogie Man, and a Frogger 
parody where you control Mojo Jojo as you help him 
escape from jail and avoid capture by the 
Powerpuff Girls.

athletic aspect. 
 
The matches itself use an abstract presentation: 
The soccer field is shown in a top-down, tactical 
perspective and the player movements are shown 
with blue and red balls. It also features a new 
meeting system where the player needs to convince 
the management of his views before important 
decisions.

Proud Family, The (c) Nov 13, 2005 Gorilla Systems 
Corporation / Buena Vista Games, Inc. 
 
The wedding anniversary for Penny Proud's parents 
is close, and that means its time to get them a 
present!  Penny made something herself, but her 
friends said that she should get them a 
T.H.A.N.G.(or Total Home Automated Necessity 
Gizmo) instead.  It's very expensive, but much 
cheaper if you buy it in pieces and self-assemble 
it.  So Penny needs to spend time working jobs to 
get enough money to buy it. 
 
The video game for The Proud Family can best be 
described as a side-scrolling adventure game.  
Players navigate through Penny's neighborhood, 
being informed of odd jobs that Penny can take to 
earn money.  Anything from picking up litter to 
working at the local Pizza Parlor, to finding 
neighbors' lost dogs on the streets.  Once Penny 
has earned enough money for a T.H.A.N.G. part, she 
can go to the store to buy it, and then the next 
chapter begins. 
 
The game also has mini-games which are based 
around Penny's official 'jobs' that she receives.  
For example, she works for her dad at his factory, 
combining various snacks to please three different 
judges.  Another mini-game has Penny competing in 
a dance-off.  And at Chez Wizard, she has to take 
up a waitress job, where she greets and seats 
customers, takes their orders, delivers their 
food, takes the payment, and clears the dirty 
dishes.  On top of this, it all has to be done 
quickly to satisfy the customers! 
 
Certain areas in the game also present themselves 
as photo opportunities.  If Penny stands close 
enough to a star marker and presses the R Button, 
she'll get a photo of one of the characters from 
the show that will be stored in her photo album.  
If she's not close enough, she'll just get a fuzzy 
photo of a UFO instead.

low for it. Naturally our heros, Amitie and her 
school nemesis Raffine, make their way toward the 
distant dark castle. Challenging, and being 
challenged by, everyone you come across in a game 
of, Puyo Pop! 
 
A puzzle game of the falling-block variety the 
goal of which is to clear your blocks (Puyos) by 
is the combining four or more of the same color 
which will vanish. This will produce Nuisance 
Puyos. These colorless Puyos will fall onto you 
opponents screen, thus blocking chains and combos 
they could create. These pesky Puyos can only be 
exterminated by removing neighboring Puyos. 
 
When an opponent send Nuisance Puyos to you screen 
you can try to "offset" by clearing your own Puyos 
and limiting the number that would fall on your 
screen. This will also increase your Fever Meter. 
When this meter fills you will be given a set of 
prearranged Puyos with which you can wrack up 
giant combos and send tons of Nuisance Puyos to 
you opponent. When any players field becomes so 
full they can no longer drop Puyos they lose the 
game. 
 
Puyo Pop Fever features a Two Player Mode. Some 
versions allow for more people such as the DS 
version which allows up to eight players to 
compete in free-for-all or team modes.

Qwak by Jamie Woodhouse (c) Dec 15, 2006 
 
In this game, you play a duck and the object of 
the game is to get the highest score without 
losing all your lives. This can be achieved by 
getting all the fruit and gems in the level, or 
killing off enemies. There are 80 levels to 
complete and once you complete all of them, the 
levels are repeated. 
 
You exit each level by collecting all the gold 
keys then entering through the door that opens. 
You have a certain amount of time to complete the 
level before spikes fall down the level. There are 
eight areas, all consisting of ten levels. At the 
end of each area, there is a guardian waiting for 
you, and again, you have a certain amount of time 
to defeat them. 
 
You kill enemies by throwing orange-colored eggs 
at them, and in the earlier levels, they go down 
in one or two shots, but in later levels, you'll 
find out that all of them take more than two shots 
to bring down, so your orange balls would be 
useless here. The solution is to get a special 
power-up that will give you chocolate eggs. 
 
Besides gold keys, you can also collect silver 
keys. This lets you unlock a gate, giving you 
access to more shots or power-ups. There are also 
booby traps in the level, such as spikes, and some 
parts of a level are blocked off by spikes. Get a 
mushroom and they turn into flowers that you can 
pick up. Beware, getting another mushroom will 
make them turn into spikes again. 
 
Apart from the normal levels, there are challenges 
where you have to complete a level and get all the 
fruit as you can under a 20-second time limit. 
Depending on gameplay, there are  also tricks 
where the last key you have to get flies away and 
you have to catch it. Other tricks include turning 
on the lights to see enemies, and running away 
from the "happy ghost". You'll receive bonus 
points at the end of the level if you manage to 
collect every gem in the level. 
 
Qwak can be played as either a one or two player 
game. The game was released at budget price, and 
later on a CD double pack with Alien Breed '92.

Racing Gears Advance (c) Feb 08, 2005 Orbital 
Media, Inc. / Orbital Media, Inc. 
 
This handheld racing game offers a range of 
licensed cars, several courses and circuits, and a 
challenging set of opponents. To these stock 
elements, it adds one more: weaponry. Now you can 
choose to nitro past the opponent ahead of you, or 
slow him down with a missile. 
 
With each vehicle and driver pair you can race in 
Practice Mode to familiarize yourself with tracks 
or choose a Championship Mode to progress through 
a series of circuits. After each race you'll need 
to spend some of the money you've earned (either 
by placing or picking up money icons during the 
race) to repair and -- if possible -- upgrade your 
car. The upgrades can improve your car as a racing 
machine (e.g. a larger engine or better brakes) or 
as a war machine (e.g. adding more weapons bays or 
buying a new type of weapon). 
 
The track design uses the isometric view, and 
almost never puts the car behind an obstacle. 
However, among the twisty roads are a few 
shortcuts that require you to think outside the 
lines of the road, and occasionally take a leap of 
faith.

Through a range of different play modes (both 
single and multiplayer), you must clear the 
playfield of four different coloured block types 
(red, blue, green and yellow). 
 
Using a similar game style to the Game Boy 
classic, Tetris Attack, a line of blocks sits 
above the play field which you can change the 
order of and drop two at a time onto the blocks 
below. Once a Detoblock (a block that is different 
in appearance to the usual blocks) appears, drop 
it onto the corresponding colour to clear those 
blocks from the field. 
 
Play modes include Clear (clean the playfield of 
all blocks), Puzzle (try and clear all blocks 
within a set number of drops), Marathon (the usual 
play as far as you can mode) and Rescue Mode, 
where you must clear the blocks from the top of a 
cage, in which the many monsters from the arcade 
hit, Rampage World Tour, are trapped in. 
 
2 player modes include Rescue (free the monster 
before the opponent to win), Score (score the most 
points in 1 minute) and Attack, in which the 
blocks you clear from your field appear on the 
opponents screen.

Rayman Advance (c) Jun 11, 2001 Digital Eclipse 
Software, Inc. / Ubi Soft Entertainment Software 
 
When a villain known only as Mr. Dark appears, 
trouble brews in Rayman's world.  Mr. Dark 
captures the Toons - source of light and Rayman's 
friends.  With no more light, evil creatures begin 
to roam, making the world unsafe for everyone.  
Its up to you, as Rayman, to free your friends and 
put an end to Mr. Dark's dastardly schemes! 
 
Rayman is side-scrolling platformer starring the 
titular Rayman, a big-nosed chap with no arms or 
legs.  Rayman can jump and use his hair to hover 
for a short period of time.  He can also attack by 
throwing his fists, or winding up his fists for a 
more powerful punch.  He can occasionally find 
special power ups that grant him unlimited flying 
power, giving him the ability to navigate through 
tricky mazes. 
 
Aside from the platforming action, the other 
notable feature of Rayman is its large, detailed 
and vibrant graphics, which have helped it to 
stand out from most other similar games in the 
genre.

Bundle of Rayman Advance and Rayman 3. 
 
In Rayman Advance, the lead character consists of 
a body, a head, two hands and two feet - no arms 
or legs. Humorous action-adventure/platformer in 
which the player must jump and climb, and defeat 
enemies. 
 
In Rayman 3 the lead character has learned some 
new abilities. His friend Globox has eaten the

Rayman 3 - Hoodlum Havoc (c) Mar 04, 2003 Ubi Soft 
Entertainment Software / Ubi Soft Entertainment 
Software 
 
Rayman returns in an all new adventure with all 
new abilities, but the same humor that has 
pervaded the series. 
 
Globox, a friend of Rayman, has placed the world 
in peril. By eating the Lord of the Dark Lums, 
Globox has enraged the Hoodlums, who plan to take 
back their master no matter what the cost to the 
world around them. It's up to Rayman to save the 
day and find a cure to rid the Dark Lord from 
Globox. 
 
New abilities, thanks to power ups littered around 
the levels, allow Rayman to use the likes of Heavy 
Metal Fist and the Shock Rocket to take down 
enemies around him, while the lock jaw allows 
Rayman to get to hard to reach places. 
 
Rayman 3 can link to a Gamecube via the link port, 
allowing players to play exclusive mini-games on 
both systems and download new levels to the GBA.

Rayman - Hoodlum's Revenge (c) Mar, 2005 Backbone 
Vancouver / Ubisoft, Inc. 
 
A spin-off in the Rayman series, Hoodlum's Revenge 
takes place directly after the events from Rayman 
3: Hoodlum Havoc and for the first in the series, 
aside from multi-player games, Rayman's friend 
Globox is featured as a playable character. 
 
After Rayman defeated the Hoodlums' leader, Andre, 
the Hoodlums decide do get revenge (hence the 
title), so they kidnap Rayman's best friend 
Globox. Rayman rescues Globox part-way through the 
game, and as the two of them find out more about 
the Hoodlums trying to clone Reflux, they decide 
to stop them for good this time. 
 
The game has slightly pixelated 3-D action 
gameplay under a fixed 2.5D isometric camera view 
(a first in the series). Several of the levels are 
puzzles in which the player must change control 
from Rayman to Globox in order to flip a switch or 
hold a button down to allow them to continue.

Rayman - Raving Rabbids (c) Dec 05, 2006 Visual 
Impact / Ubisoft, Inc. 
 
While taking a nap one fine day, Rayman was 
ambushed by a horde of mischievous, mad Rabbids!  
Secretly plotting over the years, they have at 
last unleashed their armies, ready to take over 
the world!  They've captured Rayman and all of his 
friends, stolen Rayman's fists, and scattered the 
precious Lums far and wide!  Guess who has to save 
the day once again? 
 
Unlike the console version of Rayman Raving 
Rabbids, the Game Boy Advance version of the game 
sticks to its classic side scrolling platformer 
roots, like the original Rayman.  Rayman can jump, 
glide with his hair for short distances, hurl his 
fists or throw a charged punch, pick up and hurl 
explosive barrels and other items, and even 
grapple onto special purple Lums, using them to 
swing. 
 
New to Rayman Raving Rabbids is Rayman's ability 
to gain special powers by changing into different 
costumes based on musical styles, such as hip-hop, 
punk, pop and rock.  Each costume gives Rayman a 
specific ability which allows him to reach areas 
he previously couldn't and defeat enemies.

Rebelstar - Tactical Command (c) Sep 06, 2005 Codo 
Technologies Ltd. / Namco Hometek Inc. 
 
Rebelstar: Tactical Command is a turn-based 
strategy game in the same vein as X-Com, and is 
based off the Rebelstar strategy game setting. The 
developer, Codo Technologies, is composed of staff 
who have worked on games such as Laser Squad 
Nemesis, X-Com, and the original Laser Squad and 
Rebelstar Raiders. R:TC offers a similar style of 
play, and it may appeal to fans those titles and 
turn-based strategy games. 
 
In Rebelstar: TC, players take control of a squad 
of 6 soldiers in a series of battles against an 
alien oppressor. The main character is Jorel, a 
young recruit to the rebel cause against the 
antagonist Arelian species. As the game and story 
progresses, Jorel will rise up the ranks to lead 
and recruit additional characters, each with a 
particular specialization of skills. In addition 
to fighting the Arelians, players will also do 
battle with the brutish shock troops of the Zorn, 
the insect-like Fraylar, and a variety of lesser 
creatures and robots. 
 
Gameplay revolves around the player completing a 
series of battles in order to progress the plot. 
Prior to the start of most missions, players must 
select the characters that will participate in the 
battle and equip them appropriately. Rebelstar: TC 
offers a wide range of weapons, including melee, 
assault rifles, SMGs, sniper rifles, and heavy 
weapons. Firearms may also offer different firing 
modes, such as single shot, limited burst fire, 
and full automatic. Other equipment include 
different types of body armor, grenades, power 
cells, and medical kits. Characters have a number 
of statistics that govern their movement, speed, 
weapon use, stealth, and other skills. As the game 
proceeds and characters perform various actions, 
they gain experience points and level up. Each 
level up provides an opportunity for the player to 
add skill points to a chosen skill. The greater 
the skill rating, the better the character can 
perform or utilize weapons and equipment. 
 
The battles themselves are turn-based in nature, 
with the player moving and performing actions with 
his characters, then the enemy side doing the same 
once the player is done. Each character has a pool 
of "Action Points" to spend on actions during a 
turn. A character can thus perform a series of 
actions until he or she runs out of points. These 
action points refill at the beginning of the 
player's next turn. Players can also spend all of 
the character's points to place him on 
"Overwatch." On this mode, a character will spend 
his stored action points on firing on any enemy 
that comes into his view, which is useful if you 
wish to have a character cover certain areas. 
Battles also take into account line of sight, 
terrain deformation (ie: walls blown up by 
explosives), and morale. All of these features 
give quite a number of tactical options and 
considerations to the game.

very simple - usually, only the A Button is 
required, but some games make players press 
multiple buttons for different actions.

Cleffa must make its way to the clefairy on the

still push their way heavenward. Miss a jump 
though and you'll end up as ekans foods. 
 
The way to raise your score is to make fantastic 
leaps and to get to the next tuft, and to cross 
the gorge as quickly as possible. An arrow will 
appear in the lower left hand corner of the screen 
with a number indicating how far away from your

Riviera - The Promised Land (c) Jun 28, 2005

Riviera: The Promised Land is a turn based role 
playing game. It follows a traditional RPG formula 
- once peaceful land now ravaged by demons and 
their wars with angels. However, it also 
incorporates a "dating sim" as a subplot where 
your character must win affection of another 
character. 
 
It has similarities to Fire Emblem, Final Fantasy 
Tactics, Golden Sun and a number of others. 
Reaching high levels is important to make the game 
not too difficult at the end. The levelling up is 
similar to Secret of Mana, where the weapon skill 
for a character increases at a different rate to 
the character levels.

different tracks.  These come in the form of 
standard racing, drag racing, stopping on time 
within an area, jumping onto "bullseyes", running 
circles around a cone, and more.  You'll never be 
bored from doing the same thing on the same track. 
 
Enjoy tracks that are paved, sand, and snow.  
Also, enjoy racing in the rain where traction is 
poor.  With the right upgrades to your car, you 
can handle these dangers.  Without them, you may 
not finish in the top 3. 
 
In order to progress in the challenges, you need 
to finish in the top 3 in each race.  If you 
finish first, you not only get more money, but you 
also get a prize.  Prizes are free parts for your 
car.  This can save you money and can allow you to 
get certain upgrades more quickly as not all 
upgrades are available from the start. 
 
Besides the normal challenges, there are also 
sprint races and battle races to choose from.  
Play all these races in single player, or linked 
with up to 3 other players.  Or, connect to the 
GameCube with Road Trip: Arcade to unlock more 
content. 
 
The game tracks all your parts that you have 
acquired, completed races, race results, and more.

Robots (c) Feb 22, 2005 Griptonite Games / Vivendi 
Universal Games, Inc. 
 
Based on the Blue Sky film (distributed by Fox) of 
the same name, 
Robots takes players on an adventure to save Robot 
city. When Rodney Copperbottom travels to Robot 
City to meet Big Weld, the famous inventor, he 
finds that something is wrong. Big Weld is missing 
and the evil Ratchet has taken over Big Weld 
Industries. With the help of his friends the 
Rusties, Rodney puts an end to Ratchet's 
villainous ways and restores order to the city. 
 
Robots uses a unique perspective that combines 2D 
side-scrolling with 3D views. The game takes the 
player to locations from the movie like Robot 
City, Big Weld's Mansion, the Outmode, and Madame 
Gasket's Chop Shop. Using the invention mode, 
players build and upgrade Rodney's weapons 
including the wrench, scrap gun, electro zapper, 
and magno grenade. With a combination of 
navigation, jumping, and combat skills, players 
can make their way though the world of Robots and 
bring an end to Ratchet's tyranny. 
 
In addition to the main story line, players will 
find robots in need all over the city. The parts 
these poor robots are missing can be found hidden 
in the numerous maps and returning the correct 
part rewards the player with power-ups and weapon 
upgrades. All of the maps are interconnected, so 
players can easily find their way back to a 
previous area to uncover additional secrets.The 
maps are connected with a transit ball mini-game, 
just like the transit system in the movie. 
 
The DS version of the game features a map that can 
be annotated by the player, a unique 3D version of 
the transit ball game that utilizes the stylus for 
control, and 3D menus. In addition to the new 
features, the DS also includes high resolution 
maps that include more detail than the GBA 
version.

arenas including desert outpost, sub-zero station, 
iron foundry and acid factory. 
 
There are 10 different game types, including robot 
football and sumo competitions. The RefBot 
oversees the destruction, while the most popular 
of the US robots and a range of new competitor

Rock 'Em Sock 'Em Robots (c) 2006 Full Fat 
Productions Ltd. / Destination Software, Inc. 
 
Rock 'Em Sock 'Em Robots is a handheld fighting 
game based on the toy line of the same name. It's 
a one-on-one fighting game where the player takes 
control of a robot inside a boxing ring and 
battles against other robots. Each robot has a 
special move that can be used after filling up a 
special bar. By combining different button presses 
the player can unleash a robotic rampage for extra 
damage against the enemy. It's also possible to do 
charged punches by holding down the attack button. 
Once one of the robots has lost all of its health, 
a concussion mini game is started. Here the player 
can perform a finishing move by alternately 
tapping the L and R buttons. 
 
Three game modes exists. The classic mode where 
the player can choose to play as either the Red 
Rocker or the Blue Bomber is a one-off game. In 
the versus mode it's possible to choose from some 
additional robots as well as some different 
arenas. In the title fight mode, the player starts 
out with the Red Rocker and then has to unlock the 
other by winning the fights against them.

Battle Network Rockman EXE 4.5 - Real Operation 
(c) Aug 06, 2004 Capcom Production Studio 2 / 
Capcom Co., Ltd. 
 
Rockman EXE 4.5 Real Operation is a semi-sequel to 
the previous games, Mega Man Battle Network 4 Red 
Sun and Blue Moon.  In this game, the player does 
not control Lan – instead, you play as yourself.  
Upon the game's first play, you are prompted to 
enter details such as date, time, your age and 
occupation.  You can then choose your Net Navi 
(initially available for selection are Mega Man, 
Roll, GutsMan and NumberMan). 
 
Unlike previous Battle Network games, you do not 
directly control your Net Navi.  Instead, you can 
tell your Navi which enemy they should attack, as 
well as their attacking distance, and they will 
perform according to your directions.  You can 
also select to use  Battle Chips (from three which 
are randomly selected from your folder) by using 
the Control Pad to select the chip described at 
the bottom of the screen, then pressing A to use 
it. 
 
The game also supports a peripheral created 
specifically for the game, called the Battle Chip 
Gate. This peripheral plugs into your Game Boy 
Advance, and allows the player to send their Navi 
Battle Chips during battle, much like Lan does in 
the Mega Man NT Warrior anime.  You can get 
additional Battle Chips when you purchase assorted 
Mega Man Battle Network toys, such as character 
figures.

however and controls tailored to the handheld 
console. 
 
The game features the following game modes: 
arcade, training, exhibition, career, and 
multi-player. All modes can be played in both 
singles and doubles. The arcade mode allows you to 
unlock new courts, players and gear. In the career 
mode you can start out small and use the cash 
prizes to further train your character and buy 
better gear.

In what can only be described as a bad idea 
voltorb is rolling himself down a cliff sprinkled 
with jagged rocks. What makes this such a bad idea 
is that voltorb is highly explosive! 
 
In this game you will roll down a slope being able 
to control your movement to the left and right. 
See how long you'll be able to flit between the 
rocks and keep from exploding! A magnemite will 
occasionally float by, knocking into it will 
borrow it's electric power. This power allows you 
to blast your way through rocks for a short time. 
 
The game can be accessed by scanning the long 
dot-code on the Pokemon-e Aquapolis cards Voltorb

costumes of every crook they have caught.  In each 
level, you must complete the objectives given to 
you as you move through this side scroller 
platform game. 
 
You have the ability to jump, attack, climb, and 
more as you move through each level from start to 
finish.  Don't let your courage meter drop too 
low, or you will have to start over.  It acts like 
a life meter in other games. 
 
Collect Scooby Snacks along the way and if you get 
them all, you get an extra life.  Once you 
complete your objectives and make it to the end of 
the level, a box of Scooby Snacks will appear 
allowing you to leave the level and move on to the 
next.

Scurge - Hive (c) Oct 24, 2006 Orbital Media, Inc. 
/ SouthPeak Interactive, LLC 
 
When bounty hunter Jenosa Arma takes on a mission 
to investigate Planet Inos, a research center 
investigating an alien lifeform called Scurge, she 
gets more than she bargained for.  While in orbit 
around the planet, she is attacked and quickly 
infected with the Scurge herself.  Jenosa has no 
alternative but to land onto Inos, to investigate 
the Scurge and find a cure. 
 
Scurge: Hive is an action game with some 
similarities in storyline to Nintendo's Metroid 
series.  However, the game itself is significantly 
different from Metroid. As Jenosa, players must 
blast their way through Planet Inos while trying 
to constantly contain their own infection.  While 
progressing through the game, Jenosa's 'infection 
meter' slowly increases (faster if she is standing 
on red patches of Scurge) - the meter can only be 
reduced back to 1% by using a Decontamination 
Platform, which also acts as a save point.  
Failing to temporarily cure Jenosa of the Scurge 
results in rapid depletion of life as the virus 
takes over, so players must complete mission 
objectives quickly! 
 
Jenosa can earn experience as she blasts infected 
life forms

Ghosts are everywhere. This comes as a simple fact 
to the Shaman Yoh Asakura, a young boy with the 
ability to see and talk to the spirits that wander 
the world. While he would prefer to take things 
easy, the Shaman King Tournament is coming up, and 
some of the people who want to become Shaman King 
really shouldn't be given that kind of power. 
Assisted by the ghost of a great samurai, it is up 
to Yoh to make sure the spirit world remains 
untroubled by becoming the Shaman King. 
 
Gameplay bears a close resemblance to the Pokémon 
series. Fight troubled spirits, or other Shamans. 
One spirit can attack at a time, with the ability 
to switch the attacking spirit out at any time. 
Shaman King does give you the ability to combine 
spirits, and some rare spirits can only be 
acquired in this way. 
 
Soaring Hawk differs from Sprinting Wolf in the 
selection of spirits. While most of the 1000 
spirits can be found in both versions, there are 
some unique spirits that can only be found in one 
version. You can trade spirits with your friends 
to complete your collection.

Shin Bokura no Taiyou - Gyakushuu no Sabata (c) 
Jul 28, 2005 Konami Computer Entertainment Japan,

Shin Bokura no Taiyo Gyakushu no Sabata is the 
third episode in the Boktai series and the only 
one not released outside Japan. The story takes 
place directly after the events of Boktai 2. 
Sealed up by the Lunar family long ago the ancient 
being Vanargand has been awakened and is now 
attempting to use Django's old acquaintance Sabata 
for his evil schemes. It is once again up to 
Django to clean up this mess, in order to achieve 
one of  four possible endings. 
 
As in its two predecessors the striking feature is 
once again the solar sensor that is implemented in 
the cartridge. Its main purpose is to use sunlight 
as ammo for the solar gun "Gun del Sol", making 
its comeback from the first game. Gameplay changes 
depending on if the game is played in the sun and 
how intense the sunlight is. For example, water 
disappears, light shines through the ceiling of 
dungeons or hidden passages become visible once 
the solar sensor detects sunlight. 
 
Aside for the aforementioned sunlight elements, 
the gameplay consists mainly of classic Zelda-like 
puzzle solving and a few stealth-action elements. 
For the first time in the series the game includes 
arcade-like driving sequences on a motorbike, 
which can be upgraded with various parts, 
improving its performance. By frequently hitting 
enemies the Trance gauge can be filled, allowing 
the player to transform into either Sol Django or 
Black Django, giving him special attacks. The 
motorbike mini-game can be played competitively 
with two players.

Shining Force - Resurrection of the Dark Dragon 
(c) Aug 06, 2004 Amusement Vision, Ltd. / Atlus 
U.S.A., Inc. 
 
Shining Force: Resurrection of the Dark Dragon is 
a remake of the first Shining Force game. The 
story still revolves around the Runefaust army 
trying to resurrect the Dark Dragon, but it 
features some new additions like new characters 
and additional story sequences in-between battles. 
Furthermore, dialogues have been expanded and the 
main hero has a background story now and is able 
to talk. Graphics have also received a complete 
overhaul, and the sound quality has been improved, 
although the compositions are the same as in the 
original. 
 
The heart of the game are of course the tactical 
turn-based battles. You can take up to twelve 
different members of your Shining Force into 
battle. There are many different classes ranging 
from fighters and magicians to healers, knights, 
monks, ninjas and many more. In-between battles 
you can explore various towns to buy new weapons 
and items or chat with the townsfolk. There are 
also a number of secret characters and items to be 
discovered. 
 
Shining Force's gameplay has also seen some 
changes. The interface has been slightly 
simplified and you can now organize your units 
before battles. During battles, it is now possible 
to view upcoming turns, which makes it much easier 
to plan your next steps. To make the battles more 
interesting, even for fans of the original, you 
receive certain bonuses (usually money or a 
weapon) for completing battles in a set number of 
turns. Finally, a card-collecting side-quest has 
been added. Cards can have various effects in 
battle and one character is able to transform into 
the cards that you have found.

The Dark Dragon was defeated by our hero in the 
first Shining Soul, and the people rejoiced as the 
Darkness faded away.  People are quick to forget, 
however.  As time passed, people's lives improved 
and they forgot about the Darkness.  But as the 
Light grew more and more powerful, it upset the 
balance between Light and Dark and soon Darkness 
was on the rise once again. 
 
A prophet comes and warns the people of the 
impending dangers, but no one listens to him.  
Although his crystal shows the upcoming dangers, 
the people pass by without any interest.  An agent 
of the Darkness, Gillespie, lures this prophet 
outside the city and kills him and shatters his 
crystal so the people remain ignorant of what is 
coming. 
 
This same agent gives the "Forbidden Fruit" to 
Deatharte, the trusted adviser to King Marcel in 
Klantol Castle.  The adviser didn't trust 
Gillespie, but curiosity is a powerful force. 
 
It is now up to another hero to take on the 
journey to once again stop this growing Darkness.  
After choosing your character from 8 possible, you 
start out on his or her way to a tournament being 
held at Klantol castle.  On your way, you meet an 
adventurer who will explain how to battle.  Your 
journey then takes you to the castle to start the 
tournament. 
 
This tournament is interrupted when the king finds 
out his daughter is missing.  The king's adviser 
heads out to find her, and the king asks that you 
go as well.  It is here that your story really 
begins. 
 
The gameplay is similar to most RPGs of this type 
where the monsters are fought in real-time.  An 
interesting part of this game is that your 
resistances will increase when used.  Outside the 
castle, you can stand on a fire that will not 
damage your HP, but as your resistance reacts to 
the fire, it will increase slowly.  Traps will 
also increase your resistance if you are hit by 
them, though you will also be hurt.  Only the one 
fire is safe. 
 
Take on many monsters, cast spells, get new 
equipment.  But most of all, save the world from 
Darkness.

computer. Suddenly, a message arrives: the world 
is headed towards destruction. Only he who can 
summon demons through a virtual space will be able

Long time ago, a powerful demon was captured and 
sealed within a contraption that was called 
"Messiah Riser". At present time, an evil empire 
is trying to find a key that would unlock Messiah 
Riser and unleash the power of the fiend. Two 
children Jin and Akira, the heroes of  DemiKids, 
called "The Devil Children" thanks to their unique 
ability to communicate with demons, decide to 
confront the empire and to stop their evil plan. 
 
"Messiah Riser" is a part of Devil Children games, 
which are a branch of Megaten game franchise, 
directed towards younger players. Like in all 
Megaten games, the trademark of "Messiah Riser" is 
the ability to communicate with demons you fight 
and to make them help you in battles. You can play 
the game as either Jin or Akira (the choice will 
influence the storyline). The battles are now a 
mixture between turn-based and real time style: 
enemies will perform a move even if you wait and 
do nothing, so quick thinking is necessary for 
combat. After an enemy is defeated, you can talk 
to it and try to persuade it to join your party. 
Demons will then fight for you, controlled as 
playable characters. Like in "mature" Megami 
Tensei games, you can fuse two demons to create a 
more powerful one.

Shin Megami Tensei - Puzzle de Call (c) Jul 25, 
2003 SUZAK Inc. / Atlus Co., Ltd. 
 
A puzzle game spin-off of the Devil Children 
series. Devil children Rand and Gale (half-human, 
half-demon creatures able to switch forms) go 
across a weird-looking portal in search of their 
missing friends and in order to get to them they 
must sort out several puzzle stages. 
 
The game is a top-down block-pushing puzzle game 
in which the player must use their demonic form to 
make their way across each stage collecting demon 
eggs that enhance their powers (allowing them to 
break certain blocks, etc.). "Boss" stages also 
feature a giant demon who continually attacks the 
player, whose  objective is to collect all eggs 
while avoiding attacks.

Shin Megami Tensei II (c) Sep 26, 2003 Atlus Co., 
Ltd. / Atlus Co., Ltd. 
 
Shin Megami Tensei II is a direct sequel to the  
first game. The events of this game take place 20 
or 30 years after the hero of the first game 
followed the neutral path, defeated the Asura Lord 
and the seraph Michael at the Cathedral, and 
founded a state where followers of both Law and 
Chaos ideals could live freely. But his reign of 
freedom doesn't last long. The Mesia faith gains 
power, expanding the Cathedral into a new enclosed 
environment named Millenium. The Gaians rise up, 
but their rebellion is repressed by the Mesians' 
elite warrior class, the Temple Knights. Some 
years later, a retired arena fighter Okamoto 
discovers a man fighting for his life against a 
demon. He rescues the man, who doesn't even 
remember his own name, and trains him to fight in 
the arena so they might both go on to a better 
living in one of the upper-class areas of 
Millenium. And thus the new battle for a better 
future begins... 
 
"Shin Megami Tensei II" features all the gameplay 
innovations of the previous game. You can summon 
demons, fuse them, make them battle for you, talk 
to random enemies and receive information from 
them, etc. The combat is turn-based, and you 
explore the dungeons from a first-person 
perspective view.

Shrek SuperSlam is an intense brawling game that 
challenges the wacky characters from the Shrek 
universe to beat each other up and slam them 
across a variety of arenas. All the regular Shrek 
crew is included, such as Shrek, Donkey, Fiona, 
and Puss n' Boots, along with some newcomers such 
as Cap'n Hook, the Black Knight, and Quasimodo the 
Hunchback. 
 
Each character has their own special moves that 
capture the humor of the franchise (such as 
Shrek's "Green Storm" gas bombs), and the 
environments are colorful, filled with odd 
weapons, and highly destructible. 
 
Players have the option of following a story mode 
(where Donkey tells his half-breed Donkey kids a 
strange bedtime story), or just participating in 
straight-up brawls or minigame-like challenges. 
Multiplayer, of course, is a big focus on the 
game, and it allows up to 4 players to slam each 
other all day long.

Shrek the Third (c) May 15, 2007 Vicarious 
Visions, Inc. / Activision Publishing, Inc. 
 
In the Game Boy Advance version of Shrek the 
Third, you must complete levels playing as a 
combination of Shrek, Prince Artie, Puss in Boots, 
and Donkey. The levels are mostly puzzles, where 
you can only access certain areas with a certain 
character, so all playable characters must work 
together to all reach the end. Each character has 
special abilities, such as Shrek's ground pound to 
break through pits in the ground. 
 
You will encounter many different AI types 
throughout gameplay, including evil witches, 
arrow-shooting guys, gnomes, etc. There are 
collectible faeries in each level that you must 
collect enough of to progress to the next world. 
 
This is a simple platformer-puzzle game that is 
mostly geared towards children, seeing as there 
are no lives, and relatively simple combat, but it 
should also appeal to adults who enjoy the Shrek 
franchise.

Ian Recker, a spy for Earth, is sent undercover as 
a prisoner so that he can become enlisted in the 
Krill army.  He is suited up with a parasitic suit 
of armor that gives him enhanced strength and the 
ability to merge with Krill ships, which are 
living organisms.  However, he soon discovers that 
all is not as it seems in this war, and Recker 
must decide which side he is fighting for. 
 
Sigma Star Saga is a hybrid of the side-scrolling 
shooter and RPG genres.  Players interact with 
characters and explore the overworld, and are 
frequently 'summoned' by random ships for battles. 
 To successfully complete a battle, the player 
must defeat a preset amount of enemies, and they 
gain experience with each enemy defeated.  As 
players explore the overworld, they can also 
discover Gun Data, which can be used to customize 
the player's shot with over 15,000 different 
weapon combinations using abilities such as rapid 
fire, vertical shot, and experience gain.

zones, subways, hospitals, colleges, zoos, and 
arcos which are actually cities in cities. You can 
now give names to places, and your city is

Welcome to Strangetown! The Sims 2 for Game Boy 
Advance is inspired by the weird town in the 
original PC game, but this time you're in a 
"reverse" reality show. Daddy Bigbucks (the 
villain from the game's prequel, The Urbz) is 
secretly filming a reality TV show in Strangetown, 
and pushes your own Sim to mix things up for the 
cameras. 
 
You'll make friends and enemies, have romances, 
play minigames (some of which are thinly disguised 
as fictional commercial breaks), and participate 
in 11 standalone episodes, each with their own 
plots and situations. In one episode, you might be 
dealing with Don Fusilli and his mob, in another 
episode you might be battling lady bugs after 
being shrunk down to the size of a bug by a 
homebrewed cola. 
 
Overall, the game is less of a simulation and more 
of a quirky adventure game through a colorful 
desert town.

Snood (c) 2001 Rebellion Developments Ltd. / 
Destination Software, Inc. 
 
Snood is a puzzle game based on a simple idea, of 
the kind that was commonplace in the late 1980s. 
The game is set out with a grid of small 
differently-coloured shapes, each featuring faces 
drawn on them. A succession of blocks are placed 
in an aiming device at the bottom of the screen, 
and you must rotate this so as to aim them, off 
the walls if necessary, to hit ones of the same 
colour. 
 
When 3 or more of the same colour make contact, 
they are removed from the field of play. Any 
blocks which were only connected to those blocks 
(and not to any others or the ceiling) get removed 
from play as well. This is crucial, because each 
shot that fails to drop any blocks off causes a 
meter to move on one level. When this reaches the 
top, the line of blocks drops by one level. Once 
it reaches the point where blocks are moved down 
below the playing area, it is Game Over. 
 
There are five skill levels, as well as a set of 
50 challenge levels, and a Journey mode in which 
you play through one level from each difficulty. 
From medium difficulty upwards, you'll have to 
contend with Skulls among the layout - these can 
only be removed by being dropped away.

The sequel to Snood keeps the gameplay from the

world. In this puzzle game players need to line up 
groups of three or more adjacent Snoods to remove 
them, similar to the Bust-a-move series. They are 
launched from the Snood-o-matic cannon at the 
bottom of the screen. For every Snood launched, 
the danger level increases and causes the Snoods 
at the top to move downwards. When the bottom is 
reached, the game is lost. 
 
There are five game modes available: World Tour, 
Classic, Puzzle, Journey and Armageddon. Four 
additional bonus games can be unlocked: Snood 
Ball, Snood Sideways, Snood Grab and Snood Stack, 
all with small twists on the classic gameplay. 
Multiplayer is available as well.

Soccer Kid is a platform game with some unique 
elements.  As the name implies, you have to kill 
your enemies with your ball. Football-style tricks 
of keeping the ball in the air and under control 
are especially useful - headers and overhead kicks 
can be played with practice. You gain access to 
the pieces by collecting 11 Player Cards across 
each world. 
 
There is a saving feature that gives you the 
ability to save between each country (but not

Sonic Advance 2 (c) Mar 10, 2003 Dimps 
Corporation|Sonic Team / SEGA Corporation|THQ Inc. 
 
Sonic returns for a second outing on the Game Boy 
Advance. 
 
Once again, Sonic is called upon to save the world 
from the evil Dr. Eggman. On this occasion, Sonic 
is joined by friends Tails, Knuckles and Cream and 
rabbit, the latest addition to the Sonic team. 
Each comes with a set of unique moves, allowing 
you to reach certain areas through-out the levels. 
However, unlike Sonic Advance, you must compelte 
the game as Sonic to unlock the other characters. 
 
Chaos Emeralds and Special Rings litter the 
stages. To collect the emeralds (transforming 
Sonic into Super Sonic for the final battle with 
Dr. Eggman), you must find the special rings 
hidden in each stage to unlock the bonus stage. 
Complete the bonus stage and the emerald is yours. 
 
You'll also get the chance to collect and raise 
chaos, and trade them over to Sonic Adventure 2: 
Battle on Gamecube, through the use of the GBA/GC 
link cable.

Eggman has broken the world into seven parts, now

restore the world. 
 
Sonic Advance 3 is a Sonic game with a twist: the 
player can play with a friend in co-op mode or one 
of many multi-player modes like ring race. The 
game contains features from Sonic Advance and 
Sonic Advance 2, but with more options like 
choosing from 2 characters in story mode (a 
leading and a following character).

Sonic Battle (c) Jan 05, 2004 Sonic Team / THQ 
Inc. 
 
Sonic Battle is a fast paced pseudo-fighting game, 
akin to Super Smash Brothers from Nintendo.  
Rather than being 3D side-scrolling, this game 
employs a 3D isometric view- not a static, 
sprite-based field though, it is comprised of 
actual texture-mapped polygons.  The character 
sprites are 2D though, and while you think it 
wouldn't work- it does :P 
 
You can have 9 characters to choose from, 5 modes 
of play

Sonic The Hedgehog - Genesis (c) Nov 14, 2006 
Sonic Team / SEGA of America, Inc. 
 
Sonic the Hedgehog is the first of many games 
starring Sega's premier rodent, Sonic. It's a side 
scrolling platform game with a difference: speed. 
Sonic rushes through levels with incredible speed, 
allowing him to traverse loops and jumps with 
ease. 
 
The plot of the game is simple. The evil Dr. 
Robotnik has captured many of Sonic's animal 
friends, and trapped them inside  robots.  
Fortunately, Sonic can free his friends by 
destroying the robots with his spin attack. 
Meanwhile, Dr. Robotnik is trying to control the 
all-powerful chaos emeralds. Sonic must grab them 
before he does in the 3D rotating bonus levels. 
 
Sonic's weapon is his spin attack

Bit Generations Soundvoyager (c) Jul 27, 2006 
Skip, Ltd. / Nintendo Co., Ltd. 
 
Soundvoyager is a simple action game which uses 
stereo sound to achieve goals.  The game is 
actually a variety of mini-games, which are all 
based around finding or avoiding something based 
on its aural location. 
 
The most frequently encountered game is "Sound 
Catcher".  In this game, you must guide your 
character left or right as you try to find the 
sound that you are slowly approaching.  Each time 
you find a sound, it is layered onto a song, which 
gradually becomes more complex.  After you find 
all the sounds, they fade away and you can choose 
your next path by choosing your final sound from 
the left or the right. 
 
Other games include "Sound Drive", which places 
your character on a five-lane freeway.  Based on 
the sound of the car engines and horn honking, you 
must avoid crashing into other cars by moving into 
other lanes.  A variation of this is "Sound 
Chase", where you must try and catch a sound that 
is running away from you, while simultaneously 
dodging the cars.  "Sound Cock" has players 
searching for roosters which can be heard 
clucking, but cannot be seen.  You'll need to move 
your character around based on the position of the 
rooster sounds to try and catch them.

Space Invaders (c) Mar 19, 2002 Torus Games Pty. 
Ltd. / Activision Publishing, Inc. 
 
In 1978, Earth successfully repulsed an invasion 
from outer space thanks to "the Tank."  The Tank 
was based on alien technology found when a scout 
ship had crashed years earlier.  Now, over 20 
years later, a new Tank has been created based on 
the technology recovered during the 1978 invasion. 
 And none too soon, because the Invaders are back! 
 
Space Invaders is yet another classic arcade game 
remake by Activision.  (See Battlezone and 
Asteroids.)  But this time, Activision licensed a 
game from Taito instead of Atari.  The game stays 
close to its roots while adding many power-ups and 
enemies. 
 
You can play either one or two players against the 
Invaders, who march down the screen in orderly 
rows and columns, at one of three skill levels.  
You'll start at Pluto and work your way through 
the Solar System to Mars, then Venus, and finally 
Earth.  There are four common aliens (red, green, 
blue, and yellow), plus seven more less common 
ones.  You receive special one shot power-ups by 
shooting four of the same type of Invaders in a 
row.  As in the original game, there are also 
Mother Ships that fly above the action, but in 
this version if you hit them you can pick up other 
useful power-ups like shields or double shots.  
Plus, after fighting off several waves on each 
planet, you'll face a unique boss.  If you manage 
to finish the game, you'll be able to play a 
reproduction of the original coin-op.

Speedball 2 - Brutal Deluxe (c) 2001 Bitmap 
Brothers, The / Wanadoo Edition 
 
Brutal Deluxe doesn't live up to their name - in 
fact they're the worst team Speedball has ever 
seen. As their manager, it is your job to 
transform their fortunes. As well as the league 
system, which consists of 2 8-team divisions and 
challenges you to advance to the top, there are 
also 2 cup tournaments, one of which is played out 
over 2 'legs' with the aggregate score deciding 
who progresses. 
 
You can play the matches as well, which is the 
real meat of the game. They consist of 2 90-second 
periods, and the gameplay is futuristic, fast and 
frantic, with heavy tackling encouraged to 
retrieve the ball. Power-ups and tokens appear on 
the pitch, including ones to make your players 
extra-tough or freeze the opponents. 
 
The sides of the pitch each include a score 
multiplier, which you can run the ball through to 
increase the value of your scoring - the 
opposition can sometimes immediately grab the ball 
and nullify this. There are also 5 stars which are 
worth 2 points each if you hit them (more if you 
have the multiplier activated), but these can also 
be cancelled out by the opposition hitting the 
same star, and their points values only become set 
after the half. Next to the stars there are 
'portals' which throw the ball out the opposite 
side of the pitch, in the direction it was going. 
 
You get money for the results, and by collecting 
the silver tokens which appear on the pitch at 
random intervals. Between each match you can spend 
these either on improving your existing players as 
far as they can go, or on buying better ones and 
fitting them into the team. Your original players 
can only be improved to a certain extent, so 
remembering where your signed players are and 
making use of them is important. 
 
A variety of tokens also appear during the match, 
some of which boost your team's power for a short 
period of time, and one freezes the opposition.

Spider-Man, the classic comic book co-created by 
Stan Lee, is now a major motion picture. This 
conversion of the movie to the video game world 
takes the major storyline, characters and artwork 
of the Spider-Man movie and adds a lengthy 
backstory and new characters. 
 
The Green Goblin is the main villian here, and as 
Peter Parker you must defy gravity using your 
spider crawl, web-slinging and spider-sense 
abilities to track down Spidey's nemesis through 
the skyscapers of New York City. 
 
The major inclusion for this title over the 
previous Spider-Man series (on Playstation also by 
Activision) is aerial combat. Attack the enemy 
mid-air while web-slinging, rise and decend while 
swinging and banking around buildings create a 
greater emphasis on Spidey's greatest asset, the 
spider web.

In Spirits and Spells the player takes the role of 
the two kids Alicia and Greg which visit a spooky 
old house with their friends. Unfortunately the 
Bogeyman steals the soles of their friends and 
turns them into stone - of course the two heroes 
have to get them back. So they visit the Land of 
Dead and have to survive a cemetery, a haunted 
house and the lab of a mad scientist (overall 15 
stages). 
 
The player can switch instantly (but limited 
because it costs crystals which can be found in 
the levels) between the two characters which is 
often needed to progress in the game: both have 
distinct advantages and disadvantages. Alicia is 
disguised as a witch, is strong with the ice 
element, can attack from a range and doesn't take 
damage from long falls.  Greg on the other hand is 
the master of fire, is disguised as imp and has a 
super jump. Both have also a special attack which 
also cost crystals to perform. The gameplay is the 
usual platforming along with fighting enemies. 
 
The main difference to the console version is that 
the whole game is in 2D with different level 
design and less puzzle elements.

Spyro - Season of Ice (c) Oct 29, 2001 Digital 
Eclipse Software, Inc. / Universal Interactive 
Inc. 
 
Spyro the dragon returns for his first adventure 
on the Game Boy Advance. This time, Grendor has 
turned all of the fairies of the Dragon Realms 
into ice blocks, sending out his band of Rhynoc 
warriors to collect them, and use them to stop his 
headache. Only the fire power of Spyro, with 
Hunter and Sparx on hand to help, can save the 
fairies from a certain Panadol future. 
 
Unlike the Playstation series, Seasons of Ice has 
the player controlling Spyro through an isometric 
overhead camera. However, all of Spyro's skills 
are still available to use, including his flame 
breath and glide. And the flying bonus levels 
(similar to that of the original Sonic series of 
bonus levels) make use of the Mode 7 technology in 
order to create the 3D like perspective (as used 
in Mario Kart: Super Circuit and F-Zero: Maximum 
Velocity).

SSX Tricky (c) Oct 29, 2002 Visual Impact / 
Electronic Arts, Inc. 
 
SSX Tricky is EA's follow up to SSX. Tricky 
features far more storytelling than the original 
through the use of personality attributes. 
Rivalries develop between characters with opposing 
attributes, causing them to act more aggressively 
towards each other during races. The übertrick 
system adds a whole new layer to the game. These 
tricks are much tougher to pull off, but give you 
a nice boost. Performing six übertricks in a row 
results in a super übertrick, which rewards you 
with a bigger boost and causes Run DMC's "It's 
Tricky" to play. 
 
Seven tracks return from the original accompanied 
by brand-new Garibaldi and Alaska tracks. The 
returning tracks contain up to four times as many 
shortcuts and hidden lines. Six of the eight 
riders from the original return (Jurgen and Hiro 
suffered off-season injuries) and are joined by 
six new ones. The soundtrack will feature mixes by 
Mix Master Mike, Aphrodite, and the Plump DJs. 
DVD-like bonuses include "behind-the-scenes" 
footage and a "making of" segment.

Stadium Games is a olympiad style sports game 
where you can compete in these six events: 
 
1. Shooting 
2. Archery 
3. Javelin 
4. Football 
5. Pole Vault 
6. Hammer Throw 
 
In the Shooting game, you have to shoot down pairs 
of clay pigeons that are shot in from the side. 
You view the event from a third person 
perspective, and have full control of the cross 
hair. The rest of the events are different. They 
all use timing meters, one for strength and one 
for accuracy, where the player has to hit the 
button at the right spot on the meter. 
 
Two game modes are available. Practice is the 
first, where one player can play any of the events 
at any time, without going through the rest. The 
second is the tournament where one or two players 
sharing the same machine can go through all the 
events. For each event the player will earn 
points, and there is a high score table for 
overall scores.

Star Wars - Episode II - Attack of The Clones (c) 
May 30, 2002 David A. Palmer Productions / THQ 
Inc. 
 
Ten years have past since the Battle for Naboo, 
but nothing has changed. Turmoil continues to 
surround the Galactic Republic, with a renegade 
Jedi named Count Dooku leading more then a 
thousand solar systems against the Republic. To 
make matter worse, former Queen and now Senator of 
Naboo, Padme Amidalla, is under constant threat 
from Bounty Hunters everywhere she goes. 
 
To help protect Padme, the Jedi Council order 
Obi-Wan Kenobi and Anakin Skywalker to her side. 
As you enter the story of Episode II: Attack of 
the Clones, you will control Anakin and Obi-Wan in 
their quest to find the Bounty Hunter(s) who wish 
to see the Senator dead. 
 
The game follows the script of the movie very 
closely, allowing you to visit the likes of 
Kamino, where Jango Fett hides along with the 
waiting Clone Army, as well as Geonosis, where the 
final battle takes place. 
 
You will also have an opportunity to control Mace 
Windu, fly a speeder in a 1st person perspective 
race mode, and use the force powers of the three 
Jedi to defeat the many enemies. Most of the game 
takes place in a side-scrolling, platform view, as 
well as some 1st person levels using the GBA's 
advanced semi-3D technology (as seen in Doom).

Steel Empire (c) Apr 30, 2004 Hot-B Co., Ltd. /

The skies are populated by zeppelins, large 
battleships and flying fortresses. In this age of 
steel, the Motorhead Empire has conquered and 
enslaved almost the entire planet. The last free 
nation, the Republic of Silverhead, tries to bring 
the Motorhead Empire down using its newly 
developed weapon, the lightning bomb. 
 
Apart from its unusual Steampunk setting, Steel 
Empire is a fairly traditional side-scrolling 
shooter. At the beginning of every level, the 
player gets to choose between a striker plane and 
a zeppelin. While the plane is faster, the 
zeppelin has a longer life bar and can therefore 
sustain more damage. Both ships use the same 
standard weapon, which can be fired forwards or 
backwards, as well as bombs that are released 
automatically while firing. Also available is a 
limited number of lightning bombs that damage or 
destroy all enemies on screen. 
 
Defeated enemies often drop power-ups, including 
hearts that replenish health, lightning bombs, 
bonus points, 1-UPs, options and experience 
points. 
 
Options are small "drones" that fly alongside the 
player's ship and mimic its behaviour. 
 
Experience points can be collected to level up the 
ships' weapons (up to level 20) and thereby 
increase their fire power.

Interactive Ltd. / Capcom Entertainment, Inc. 
 
Street Fighter Alpha 3, the third game in the 
Alpha series, has a total of 31 fighters, the most 
in the series so far. New characters include old 
favorites E. Honda, Blanka, Vega, Cammy, T. Hawk, 
Dee Jay, Juni and Juli. Some of the newest 
fighters on the block include a former Final Fight 
character (Cody, who has been in jail since the 
last Final Fight game, or so his clothing 
suggests), Karin Kanzuki and Rainbow Mika. 
 
The major difference between this Alpha and the 
last two are the new play modes World Tour, 
Arcade, VS, Training and Entry. 
 
World Tour - Simply choose your fighter and travel 
around the world, fighting the home town heroes 
that you run into. The more fights you win, the 
stronger you fighter becomes. You can also learn 
new moves, and there are three levels of Super 
moves to choose from before you start each round 
(called Isms). 
 
Arcade - A simple conversion of the arcade 
version. Beat each fighter with your chosen 
warrior, in three rounds per match (much the same 
as past versions of Street Fighter) 
 
Versus - Two human players battle it out. 
 
Training - A good way to learn all the super moves 
that are available, against a dummy. 
 
Entry - If you save your character during the 
World Tour mode, you can upload him here to use in 
the other modes in the game (especially handy for 
Training). 
 
Finally, if you complete certain areas of the game 
three new fighters become available, including 
another old favourite in Guile, Evil Ryu and Shin 
Akuma.

world talking to NPCs for items and clues and 
dungeon-crawl to gather the materials needed to 
create your weapons. When in combat, the game 
switches to a side-scrolling view in which you 
attack and attempt to avoid your enemies attacks

Three years after your father was lost, you are an 
apprentice Craftknight.  A tournament is held to 
find the next Craftlord and you're in it.  But 
first, you need a weapon.  Unlike many RPGs, you 
cannot find or buy weapons to use in this game.  
Instead, you must learn to make your own weapons.  
To make a weapon, you'll need to know the 
technique of making a specific weapon as well as 
the raw materials to make it with. 
 
You aren't alone in the game.  As a partner, you 
will get a Guardian Beast who will offer magic to 
help you in your battles as well as helping you 
make your weapons.  You can get four different 
Guardian Beasts depending on your choices, each 
with different abilities. 
 
Besides the tournament, you need to gather raw 
materials to make better weapons by travelling 
through a large dungeon and battling the creatures 
you find there in a side-scrolling battlefield 
similar to Tales of Phantasia.  You will also have 
the opportunity to spend time with your summon 
creature and certain other characters each night.  
Who you choose to spend time with will affect the 
story somewhat.

You are a male or female apprentice Craftknight 
and the Edge Fencer.  It is your job to protect 
the seal trapping Goura, a stray summon creature 
who is too powerful for anyone to control.  
Similar to Summon Night: Swordcraft Story, your 
father died 3 years ago.  He died trying to trap 
Goura after a summoner tried to free Goura and 
take control of him.  Now it is your job to 
protect that seal, while you are working at 
becoming a Craftknight. 
 
A Craftknight is a person who creates weapons and 
uses them, similar to an armorer.  However, these 
weapons are made with the combined power of your 
hammer and your Guardian Beast.  You will have the 
ability to choose between 4 Guardian Beasts 
shortly after starting the game.  Each one has 
different abilities and will have different 
conversations throughout the game.  Unlike in the 
previous game, you do not learn techniques for 
making weapons, but instead you use shapestones to 
create a weapon type.  There are 6 weapon types 
that can be made and you will need at least a 
basic weapon from each type in order to reach all 
areas of the game.  The actual weapon you create 
will be determined by the material you use to 
create it.  If you make it with Iron Ore, it will 
be one kind of weapon, while if you make it with 
Aqua Ore, it will be another kind of weapon.  
Later, you will have the ability to upgrade the 
weapons up to three times each. 
 
Battles are the same as in the previous game. You 
fight in a side scrolling area with up to 4 
enemies.  You can use your weapon to attack, or 
use your Guardian Beast's magic to attack, heal or 
protect you, or enchant your weapon in some way.  
Some weapons will also have special attacks that 
can do even more damage.  In this game, you'll 
have battles above and below ground, rather than 
just in the dungeon and arena.  You also have the 
ability to Mono Shift, where you will change into 
a more powerful being.  You can only do this once 
before recharging the item that allows you to Mono 
Shift.

Sum of All Fears, The (c) Nov 12, 2002 Red Storm 
Entertainment, Inc. / Ubi Soft Entertainment 
Software 
 
The Sum of all Fears is a first person shooter 
game reminiscent of the Rogue Spear series. It's 
from the same development team and the look and 
feel is alike, although it's not as tactical as 
Rogue Spear. 
 
The game's story is build around the Tom Clancy 
book with the same title. You take control of a 
team of elite fighters trained for hostage rescue 
and anti-terror operations. Each and every team 
member is the best of the best. The first mission 
is to recapture a TV station seized by terrorists 
who broadcast their demands into the world. They 
have hostages, too, so you need to ensure that 
no-one gets hurt. But that's only the beginning of 
a global campaign against terrorism taking in 11 
missions. A training mode and multiple difficulty 
levels are included. 
 
Unlike Rogue Spear, you can't choose team members 
or equipment, it's all pre-defined, from a range 
of over 15 guns plus grenades . You can't make 
your own mission plans either, so it comes down to 
controlling a team member, shooting every 
terrorist you see and performing various tasks 
(disarming security systems etc.). Unlike other 
shooter games, you can't survive many bullets, two 
wounds is usually enough to kill you. However, you 
then can switch to another team member.

Super Bubble Pop (c) Dec 17, 2002 Runecraft, Ltd. 
/ Jaleco Entertainment, Inc. 
 
A combination of Tetris and Bust-A-Move, Super 
Bubble Pop has you controlling a character along 
the bottom of the playfield, who you use to throw 
bubbles of different colours towards the other 
side of the playfield. As you throw them down the 
line, they will stack up in piles of six. Linking 
three bubbles together will pop them (remove them 
from the field), and if there is a stack of six, 
the bubbles on the way will form a new stack in 
front of it. 
 
The aim of the game is to remove all bubbles from 
the field, but there is another way of completing 
a game. Tokens will appear during play, and by 
collecting enough, you can move on to the next 
round regardless of what you have on the 
playfield.

Super Bust-A-Move (c) Nov 28, 2001 Taito 
Corporation / Ubi Soft Entertainment Software 
 
Super Bust-A-Move brings with it all of the 
entertaining puzzle action of the series with the 
addition of new multiplayer modes and graphical 
improvements. 
 
The aim of the game, as with the previous titles 
in the series, is to remove a collected number of 
coloured bubbles from the game screen. To do so, 
at the bottom of the screen, you aim and fire the 
coloured bubbles from a launcher, sending the 
bubbles upwards into the container. Match three or 
more together of the same colour to clear them 
from the screen. If you're too slow, the 
collection of bubbles moves down the screen 
towards you, and the game will end if it reaches 
the bottom. 
 
Classic mode features a number of bubble puzzles 
previously seen in the Bust-A-Move series, while 
Normal mode has some new variations on the bubble 
removing theme. Two players can also compete 
against each other.

Super Collapse II (c) Mar, 2004 GameHouse, Inc. / 
Majesco Sales, Inc. 
 
The game concept is that you have to eliminate 
clusters of at least 3 blocks with your mouse, but 
the more you remove at once, the more you score. 
Once that happens, all blocks above the ones, 
which have vanished, will fall down and close the 
gap. 
 
Beneath the lowest row, there you see the new row 
building up. Once all blocks are present, this row 
will be now the lowest row, while all others are 
moving up. Once one block reaches the top of the 
playfield, you loose. 
 
Each individual level has a preset value of rows, 
which will build up. To win a level, all you have 
to do, is to prevent that a full vertical row 
(from bottom to top) gets stacked up. 
 
The game offers 4 game modes: Traditional, Puzzle, 
Relapse, and Strategy. Two of them need a brain, 
while the other two just need a fast hand. 
 
Traditional works like explained above. New rows 
show automatically, with increasing speed not only 
from level to level, but also in a level. Means: 
the level starts slow, but in the end, new rows 
will complete every second. Power-Ups are 
available in this game mode. 
 
Relapse works exactly like Traditional, but with 
one major difference. The action isn't just 
limited to the bottom of the playfield, in fact, 
both bottom and top now filling with blocks. 
Power-Ups used on one side affecting both. How to 
win is the same, but you loose, when blocks from 
one side touching the other. 
 
Strategy is one of the two game modes where you 
must think. Clicking fast will only help to see 
the Game Over screen. New rows won't appear 
automatically, instead for each cluster you 
remove, a full new line will appear. So you have 
to plan carefully before neutralizing a cluster. 
 
Puzzle is the game mode, where no new lines 
appear. Also there are no Power-Ups here. But this 
is the most complex game mode. Your task is to 
completely remove all blocks, if at least one 
block is still available, you loose. There is also 
no time limit, so you can think as long as you 
want. 
 
The first three game modes offering bonus levels, 
which works like the Puzzle mode. So, if one block 
remains, you only scoring the normal points for 
removed clusters. Only when all blocks are 
removed, you score the bonus points. There are 
only two differences: it isn't so complex, and you 
only have 15 seconds time. 
 
There are 5 different Power-Ups in the game (2 
good, 2 bad, 1 depending of the situation): 
Platform Block (won't move, just blocking the 
vertical row where it is), Indestructible Block 
(does move like a regular block, but can't removed 
with normal actions), Color Bomb (one of each of 
the 5 colors, will detonate all same colored 
blocks in it's big radius), Super Bomb (shorter 
range than the Color Bomb, but blow up all blocks, 
regardless the color

short burst of invincibility. 
 
Each level includes a bonus section filled with

Aug 10, 2004 Nintendo Co., Ltd. / Nintendo Co., 
Ltd. 
 
The Princess has been kidnapped by King Koopa 
(again) and it's up to Mario and Luigi to save her 
(again).  Not to be confused with the western 
Super Mario Bros. 2, this sequel to Super Mario 
Bros. is very much an expansion to the original, 
with many reused graphics and concepts, though new 
ones are also present. 
 
Instead of offering a two-player mode as in the 
original, this game allows you to choose between a 
Mario mode and a Luigi mode, with each character 
handling differently.  Mario has tighter ground 
control, while Luigi has greater jumping 
capabilities. 
 
Power-ups remain the same: Super Mushrooms grow a 
brother from small to Super size, Fire Flowers 
give them the ability to throw fireballs at 
enemies, Starman makes a character temporarily 
invincible, and a 1-Up Mushroom will give one more 
life.  New to this game is a power-down, a Poison 
Mushroom which will harm you as if it were an 
enemy. 
 
The goal is still to survive from the left side of 
the level to the right, avoiding perils and 
bopping enemies along the way, progressing through 
a series of 8 worlds with 4 levels each.  That is, 
unless a warp zone is found allowing areas to be 
skipped.  There are new tricks that work for and 
against the player, though.  Some piranha plants 
will come out of their pipe even if you're 
standing right next to them, and bloobers now 
appear outside of the water.  Wind can be present 
to alter how jumps will behave.  Some warp zones 
will actually take the player to an earlier level 
instead of to a later one.

Mario and his brother Luigi are back for this 
second Super Mario Advance title: the first being 
a remake of Super Mario Bros. 2. The brothers, 
along with Princess Peach, are vacationing in 
Dinosaur Island. Then when they least expect it, 
Bowser once again kidnaps Peach and takes her to 
his castle. On the way to rescue her, the plumbers 
find Yoshi, who tells them that Bowser has also 
turned his friends into eggs. So the Mario 
brothers, with the help of Yoshi, must rescue the 
princess and Yoshi's pals. 
 
Mario and Luigi can run and jump through each 
level. They can also collect power-ups to gain new 
skills. The Super Mushroom makes them grow and 
gain more defense. The Fire Flower lets the 
brothers throw fireballs to defeat enemies. The 
Starman makes them invincible. The plumbers can 
gain the ability of flight with the Cape Feather. 
 
Yoshi can help Mario and Luigi if they find an 
egg. The green dinosaur can use his tongue to eat 
enemies or grab power-ups. He can walk across 
certain enemies with his shoes. Yoshi can eat 
differently colored 
Koopa shells to briefly gain more abilities. For 
instance, the blue shell gives him wings, red 
shells let him spit fireballs, and the yellow 
shell allows him to stomp the ground. 
 
This update over the original Super Nintendo 
version includes character speech (as heard in 
Mario Advance and Mario Kart Super Circuit). Up to 
four players can compete in the classic Mario 
Bros. game, included with the main game.

Colored gems fall from the top of the screen in

your opponent with counter gems you have to place 
a crash gem of the same color next to the gems. If 
you make a block of gems of the same color they'll 
fuse, forming a power gem. Breaking a power gem 
sends more counter gems to your opponent than 
breaking the same amount of gems in some other

power gems in chain.

Super Robot Taisen - Original Generation 2 (c) Nov 
14, 2006 Banpresoft Co., Ltd. / Atlus U.S.A., Inc. 
 
Super Robot Taisen: Original Generation 2 is a 
strategy RPG in which players lead a small force 
of mechs in a fight to save humanity from an alien 
invasion. The designs of the mechs, pilots, and 
attacks are heavily influenced by anime. 
 
The combat system of this game is similar to its 
predecessor. The player controls multiple mechs 
and issues commands in a turn-based fashion. Each 
mech pilot has "spirit commands" that can be used 
to strengthen a mechs abilities such as its hit or 
dodge rate. After moving a unit, the player is 
usually given the option to attack an enemy with 
an attack from a list. After all of the player's 
mechs have been moved, the AI gets a turn to move 
its mechs. If a player mech is attacked, the 
player has the option of counter-attacking, 
attempting to evade, or defending. 
 
Super Robot Taisen: Original Generation 2 does 
include a few minor changes to the battle system. 
For one thing, a new attack type (known as a chain 
attack) allows a unit to strike multiple enemies 
in a single blow. Also, the AI has been vastly 
improved. 
 
The graphics of Super Robot Taisen: Original 
Generation 2 have been enhanced from the graphics 
of the original. Attacks from mechs now have a 
more fluid motion and are generally more 
interesting to look at. 
 
The game's story picks up six months after the 
original Super Robot Taisen: Original Generation 
left off. Most people on Earth are still trying to 
recover from the battle with the Aerogaters, but a 
small remaining faction of the Divine Crusaders is 
still trying to further their goals. Once again, 
it's up to the SRX and ATX teams of the EFA to put 
a stop to their activities and restore order. 
However, they are soon interupted by two new 
groups of mysterious enemies: the Einsts and the 
Inspectors.

Tactics Ogre - The Knight of Lodis (c) May 07, 
2002 Quest / Atlus U.S.A., Inc. 
 
The fourth US release in the Ogre Battle series, 
The Knight of Lodis follows Alphonse, a young

entirely consists of combat.  Aside from the main 
campaign, Tactics Ogre also offers a VS mode and a 
Quest mode, in which the player must complete 
objectives they set themselves within a certain 
number of turns to earn rare items to use in the 
campaign mode.  Finally, there is also an option 
to exchange characters and items between players 
with a link cable.

Helixe / THQ Inc. 
 
Apprentice shaman Tak has been having strange 
dreams after his first adventure. In his sleep he 
fights the Dream Guardian who possesses a 
mysterious staff. A creature calling itself the 
Dream Juju grabs the staff and disappears. With 
the help of your mentor Jibolba and his brother 
JB, you find out it was a vision about the theft 
of the Staff of Dreams, an item can open a portal 
for nightmare creatures. 
 
You guide Tak in this side-scrolling 2D platformer 
as he sets off to retrieve the magical scepter. He 
can jump, use items and has an inventory, but you 
can also collect magical powers to build up the 
Juju meter. With a maxed out meter, you get access 
to special abilities such as double jumps, rolls, 
floating and ground stomps. These powers are also 
used to solve puzzles. Each region has a Yorbel 
Store where you can buy power-ups with yorbels, 
collected during the levels or earned by playing a 
mini-game. 
 
By filling up magical bottles with energy, you get 
access to the parallel Dream World where hidden 
platforms in the regular levels are revealed. 
There are nine worlds to explore and you can save 
one game on the cartridge.

Tales of Phantasia (c) Mar 06, 2006 Namco Tales 
Studio Ltd. / Nintendo of America Inc. 
 
In "Tales of Phantasia", you play a young boy 
named Cless, who lives together with his parents 
in a quiet village. It was a day like all the 
others when Cless decided to go hunting with his 
best friend Chester. Chasing a wild boar, Cless 
discovered a strange talking tree in the forest 
who was pleading him for help. But as soon as it 
stopped speaking, the two friends heard the sound 
of an alarm. They returned to the village and 
found it burnt down, and all its inhabitants 
murdered. Before Cless' mother died in his arms, 
she told him this terrible massacre had something 
to do with the pendant she and her husband gave 
Cless for his birthday... what connection could 
there be? Cless decides to visit his uncle who 
lives in another town, but he doesn't realize his 
journey will take him to much more remote places 
than that! 
 
"Tales of Phantasia" presents a unique combat 
system: The battles have a lot in common with 
fighting games: you fight on a platform that 
slowly scrolls forward and have to attack your 
enemy in real time. Other party members are 
controlled by AI. You can pause the game at any 
time and use magic, items, or choose an overall 
strategy for your allies.

Thunder Alley is a racing game for the Game Boy

perspective and uses Sennari Interactive's ray 
tracing engine from Driver 2. The cast of the game 
are all characters from the Tin Pin Alley series 
of bowling games. The game features two game 
modes: Practice Race, which is just the player 
racing around as he wishes, and Tournament Race, 
where the player competes against AI-controlled 
drivers. Throughout the game's tracks, the player 
will come across power ups that boosts the speed 
of the player car and obstacles that hinder it 
like for example oil which causes the car to spin 
around. There's four different tracks in the game, 
each with its own layout and appearance, although 
the difference between them is very small.

(which in turn was based on the 1960s series 
starring marionettes), Thunderbirds stars Alan, 
Tin-Tin, and Fermat, three children whose 
guardians are part of the International Rescue

children as they go through training and are then 
forced to travel around the world to save members

as The Hood. 
 
The game takes place in locales such as the 
International Rescue island, Africa, and even 
outer space. Each of the three characters has his 
or her own unique abilities that the player must 
use to solve puzzles and advance through a level. 
Alan has strength and jumping ability, Tin-Tin has 
telekinetic powers that are used to move objects, 
and Fermat can hack computers and roll through 
holes. While the majority of the gameplay is 
primarily composed of solving puzzles from an 
overhead view, there are also flight action 
sequences where the player can fly one of the many 
vehicles known as the Thunderbirds.

Eclipse Software, Inc. / Electronic Arts, Inc. 
 
Tiger Woods is back for another round of golf in 
the 2004 edition of the "best selling pro golf 
series". 
 
The biggest addition to this version is EA's Game 
Face, which lets you customize everything and 
anything.  You have the basics, such as hair, 
skin, facial hair and other general appearances, 
but Game Face allows you to customize every other 
aspect, from teeth shape, logos, tattoos, 
headbands, hats, and more.  You may also change 
individual body mass, muscle tone, mid-section, 
arms and legs.  You also have the option of 
choosing specific swing style animations, 
post-putt and celebration animations, and "pissed 
off" animations for when you score a triple bogey. 
 
One of the new modes is World Tour, which puts you 
through a standard 52-week PGA tour to earn money, 
sponorships, and better gear.  You can play for up 
to twenty seasons.  The other new game mode is 
Battle Golf, where you can win an opponent's clubs 
if you beat them.  All the other standard game 
modes are here, from Skill Challenge and Speed 
Golf to a Skins Match or Practice. 
 
A new feature is the game's ability to read your 
console's internal clock, and provide you with 
game modes.  If it's near the end of October and 
your clock is properly set, you may be invited to 
a Halloween event where you can win items specific 
to that event. 
 
All top PGA players are included for you to play 
as (or against), including Vijay Singh and Justin 
Leonard.  Newcomers to the sport have also been 
added, such as John Daly. 
 
Most of the courses from 2003 have made it, with 
seven new courses, both real and fantasy.  One of 
the new courses is Bethpage Black, an extremely 
difficult course located in Washington. 
 
Like all other 2004 EA Sports console games, Tiger 
Woods PGA Tour 2004 has the EA Sports Bio, which 
tracks your accomplishments and games over all EA 
Sports titles.  The more EA Sports games you play, 
and the longer you play them, will increase your 
EA Gamer Level and unlock additional rewards, such 
as a new driver in Tiger Woods or historic teams 
in NHL 2004.  This feature isn't on the PC 
version. 
 
Gamers who buy the PlayStation 2 version will be 
able to play online through EA's matchmaking 
service.  You cannot play online with the Xbox or 
GameCube versions. 
 
If you buy the GameCube version, you can use the 
GameBoy Advance to hook up to the GameCube to 
unlock special rewards not available through 
normal play.

Halloween Town is preparing for this year's 
Halloween, and Jack Skellington is sure that this 
one will be the best ever!  However, Oogie Boogie 
has other plans - furious that he has no holiday 
of his own, he commands Lock, Shock and Barrel to 
kidnap Jack so that he can take his place as the 
King of Halloween and claim the holiday for 
himself.  Unfortunately, the trio kidnap Sally by 
mistake.  Angered by their bumbling, Oogie Boogie 
releases thousands of bugs into Halloween Town, 
sending the citizens into hiding.  It's up to Jack 
to save Halloween Town...and his holiday! 
 
Tim Burton's The Nightmare Before Christmas: The 
Pumpkin King is an action-adventure game similar 
to Castlevania: Circle of the Moon.  The game is 
set before the movie The Nightmare Before 
Christmas, before Jack's encounter with Santa 
Claus and Oogie Boogie.  The game takes place in 
one gigantic overworld which Jack can explore.  As 
he earns new weapons, such as the Frog Gun and Bat 
Boomerang, he can unlock new areas and access more 
of the overworld.  Early in the game, he'll also 
find his ghost dog, Zero, who can help by finding 
secret areas and navigating through small spaces. 
 
The game also features three mini-games that can 
be played either against the computer, or versus 
up to three friends.  There's 'Bone Breaker', 
where you must be the first to smash the skeleton, 
'Whack Hammer', where you must smash as many rats 
and bats as possible, and 'Skulldigger', you must 
find the correct box with the Shrunken Head.

TMNT (c) Mar 20, 2007 Ubisoft Divertissements Inc.

Cowabunga! Take control of your favourite turtle 
ninjas as you play through the events of the 2007 
CGI movie. The turtles have grown apart, and 
Raphael has taken to crime fighting solo under the 
guise of the Nightwatcher.  The Foot Clan are 
turning up in the streets again, and a mysterious 
man known as Winters seems to be involved with 
them. Only the Ninja Turtles can clean up the 
streets! 
 
The Game Boy Advance version of TMNT can be best 
described as similar to the NES game River City 
Ransom.  Players take control of either a specific 
turtle or the turtle of their choice (depending on 
the mission), and fight through waves of enemies 
in a sidescrolling beat-em-up style.  Enemies will 
drop the usual health pickups, but also drop money 
and weaponry.  Money can be used to purchase 
weapons or upgrades between missions, while 
weapons can be used as a more powerful tool to 
defeat your foes (however, these weapons have a 
limited use).  After the completion of a mission, 
experience is earned, and after a certain amount 
of experience is gained, you can level up the 
turtles to improve their fighting statistics. 
 
Each turtle has their own specific weapon: 
Leonardo with his dual Katana, Michelangelo with 
his Nunchucks, Donatello with his Bo Staff and 
Raphael with his two Sai.  These weapons are used 
in their standard attacks.  A basic attack is 
performed with the B Button, but you can perform 
different attacks with B and other buttons such as 
the directions of the Control Pad and the A 
Button.  Uppercuts, Sweep Kicks, Jump Kicks and 
more can be performed, and you can even juggle 
enemies in the air to get more hits in and 
increase your score.

   bats and plates, all capable of causing damage 
   they were not designed for.  Fight wacky boss

will not. Entering like a ghost, you'll have to 
rely to the stealth and make a good use of your 
surrounding to avoid direct conflict and end up 
outnumbered. The missions will follow pretty much 
the same storyline as the original game for 
PC/GC/PS2/XBOX with the emphasis on being a

The hand-held version features the same story as 
its console cousins, but tells it in a completely 
different way using a side-scrolling view with 22 
different objectives and new locations to play in. 
The same stealth maneuvers can be used in this one 
as well: using shadows to hide, sneaking around, 
using human shields, forcing suspects to talk and 
even hide behind objects. 
 
Night and Thermal vision can be used at any time 
and features three different scope views: Camera 
Shoot, Sniper and Laser Mic.  Things like 
rappelling from rooftops and lock picking are 
still a part of the game, but is done in the form

The portable addition of Tony Hawk's latest

altogether different experience, especially in 
terms of the visual presentation. 
 
Pushing aside realism, Sk8land goes with a 
cel-shaded atmosphere, where the same gameplay 
mechanics of skaing around each park completing 
objectives and challenges are as addictive as 
always. 
 
Nintendo DS players will also take Sk8land online 
through the wi-fi mode, along with touch screen 
controls. GBA players aren't left behind either, 
with an updated create-a-park and skater modes and 
multiplayer to boot.

Tony Hawk returns with an all new line-up of 
skaters, an all new line-up of parks to crash 
through, and a whole new level of graphics. 
 
The line-up of street and vert riders include 
Elissa Steamer, Jamie Thomas, Steve Caballero, 
Rune Glifberg, Geoff Rowley, Andrew Reynolds, 
Rodney Mullen, Eric Koston, Chad Muska, Bucky 
Lasek and Bam Margera from MTV's Jackass (and Tony 
Hawk, of course). 
 
The create a skater mode returns, allowing for 
even further levels of options for your character, 
like adding glasses and tatoos to changing the 
colour of the knee and elbow pads or even the 
hair. 
 
And the levels themselves that you must skate 
through are now more interactive, with cars and 
humans blocking paths and making noise as you race 
around to make as many points as possible. Use 
items around the streets or the park to jump from 
or over to increase your score, and pull of as 
many wild and wacky tricks as you can.

Tony Hawk's Pro Skater 4 (c) Oct 29, 2002 
Vicarious Visions, Inc. / Activision Publishing, 
Inc. 
 
THPS4 is the fourth game in Activision's ever 
popular franchise. 
 
The main feature of this game is it's redesigned 
career mode.  When beginning a level, you have all 
the time in the world to skate around, perform 
tricks, get a feel for the level, without the 
hassel of any goals or time limits.  When you're 
ready to attempt a goal, simply find a pro skater, 
talk to him, then receive the goal, similar to 
Dave Mirra Freestyle BMX.  Goals are similar to 
the previous games, such as collect SKATE, get a 
certain amount of points, transfer over this and 
grind that.  There are new goals, however, such as 
collecting the word COMBO while doing one big 
combo.  Miss a trick, and goal fails.  Once all 
regular goals are accomplished, you can attempt 
the Pro Goal, which is specific to each skater, 
and is extremely hard. 
 
All the major skaters are here, including Tony 
Hawk, Bob Burnquist, Steve Caballero, Kareem 
Campbell, Rune Gilfberg, Eric Koston, Bucky Lasek, 
Bam Margera, Rodney Mullen, Chad Muska, Andrew 
Reynolds, Geoff Rowley, Elissa Steamer and Jamie 
Thomas. 
 
The levels are been expanded and are huge.  Some 
of the levels include a college campus, a 
shipyard, and the infamous prison complex 
Alcatraz. 
 
For multiplayer, all the favorite modes are back, 
from Graffiti and Trick Attack to Horse and King 
Of The Hill.  New modes include Capture The Flag 
and Combo Mambo.  THPS4 also supports System Link 
play, but not XBox Live. 
 
The PlayStation 2 version offers everything from 
the XBox version, but also has online play, 
utilizing either your own network adaptor or the 
official one.  The PS2 version also features a one 
level demo of Shaun Murray's Pro Wakeboarder, 
which is not featured on any other version of the 
game.

Top Gear GT Championship carries the official 
Japanese GT title and lets players race fast cars 
on different GT tracks. The game features two main 
game modes: quick race and championship. In quick 
race, players can alone, against another human 
player or create custom courses for the game. This 
is further divided into versus games against the 
computer and time attack. The game can also 
connect through mobile phones to check global 
rankings, enter local ranking entries, and 
download ghosts and new courses. 
 
In the championship mode, players need to complete 
the courses in a fixed order while a ranking is 
kept. The cars are shown from a third-person 
perspective and there are different AI-controlled 
racers to beat. Prior to the races, players can do 
free runs, qualify and eventually start the race 
or tune the car further. There are two weather 
types, sunny and rainy, which affects the handling 
of the cars. 
 
There are different cars and courses to choose 
from, with extensive tuning options based on the 
gear ratio, steering, brakes, tires, aerodynamic 
settings and the height handicap. There are also 
three difficulty levels.

Trick Star is a futuristic racing game where the 
racers ride slick one-wheeled bikes. Players race 
along the track, with the goal of not only coming 
first, but also performing stunts to impress the 
crowds. Stunts cannot be performed until a certain 
speed is reached, and the "Trick Star" appears on 
the HUD. When it appears, players can perform a 
stunt by holding L or R, as well as any direction 
on the Control Pad. Performing stunts also fills 
your boost meter - when it is full, you can press 
L and R simultaneously to get an extra boost. 
 
In League Mode, players must complete three 
tracks, as well as scoring enough points to 
qualify for the Challenge Mode. Once the player 
has enough points, they can enter Challenge Mode, 
where they are asked to perform a particular set 
of stunts in between markers. When they succeed, 
they are rewarded with additional stunts and 
progress to the next set of tracks. 
 
Trick Star also includes one player at a time 
multiplayer, for up to four players. Players can 
compete in Time Trial (aim for the fastest time), 
Stunts (get the highest stunt point score), Long 
Jump (jump the longest distance along the track) 
and Challenges (complete the required challenges). 
After each player has had a go, the results are 
shown.

levels without falling over the edge. There's 
seven different levels in total and includes a 
jungle, volcano and a space station. 
 
There's a number of power ups or items available 
that are necessary to complete a challenge. First 
of all the player ha to fins keys to unlock doors. 
These come in different colors that have to match. 
Some tiles have arrows on them which force the 
player in the direction they face. To overcome 
this the player can use his turbo speed. Some of 
the ground is weak and can collapse when rolling 
over it. Often the player will come across gaps. 
For this there's a build item and a jump item. 
There's also gravity and wind which drag or push 
the the player. The turtle's shell can be upgraded 
in three ways. There's a glide shell which allows 
the player to go faster over slow ground, the 
panzer shell which allows the player to pass 
through force fields and the spike shell which 
allows the player to get a better grip on slippery 
ground such as ice.

Goomba V2.2 - NES Conversion - Urban Champion (c) 
Nov 11, 2002 Nintendo Co., Ltd. / Nintendo of 
America Inc. 
 
Two rival characters meet up one day on the city 
streets and arrange a fight. Both characters will 
start in the middle with two blocks on either side 
of them leading to an open manhole. The first 
person to knock the other into the open manhole is 
the winner. Only punches are allowed, although 
obstacles such as falling flower pots can occur 
and give one player the advantage. Also, everyone 
is to look innocent should the police drive by. 
 
This is a very early and simplistic fighting game. 
As mentioned, each player can only punch the 
other, trying to knock them off the screen and 
towards one of the waiting manholes.

Urbz, The - Sims in the City (c) Nov 09, 2004 
Griptonite Games / Electronic Arts, Inc. 
 
In this quasi-sequel to The Sims: Bustin' Out, the 
player finds themselves in the big city of 
Miniopolis. Starting out as a humble window 
washer, the player is quickly embroiled in a 
devious plot by the greedy tycoon Daddy Bigbucks 
to take over the city. 
 
The story is much stronger this time around, with 
the player exploring three colorful city 
environments, including the New Orleans-influenced 
SimQuarter, the shiny Glasstown district, the 
gritty Urbania, and even a haunted bayou inhabited 
by two creepy Cajun brothers. 
 
In addition to the traditional Sims gameplay of 
satisfying motives, making friends, and decorating 
an apartment, the player can experience eight job 
minigames, a "xizzle" system that lets players 
learn special abilities, and several new vehicles, 
including a motorcycle, hoverboard, and fanboat. 
Combine all that with a wacky sense of humor, and 
you get The Urbz: Sims in the City.

Calling in for help, he find the people of Big 
Piney more then happy to help ... at a price. Wade

way around the town against a range of strange 
characters ready to punch his lights out. To make 
enough money to fix the car, and make it out of 
the town alive, he'll be put to the test in and 
out of the ring. 
 
The non-linear style of the game leaves you with

the boat up front, and must pull of tricks either 
by jumping of jumps or using the wake left by the 
boat itself (hence the sports name). 
 
Unleashed takes this sport and turns it upside 
down, allowing you to fly down water ways through 
well known locations around the world, pulling 
stunts off buildings or cliff faces. Other 
objectives are included that have you completing 
tasks and busting tricks in a unique way. 
 
Multiplayer modes include one-on-one trick attack 
and horse, where both players compete against each 
other to pull off the best tricks.

Wario's thrown a temper tantrum while playing his 
Game Boy Advance, and gone and broken it!  He 
heads off to the manic Dr. Crygor's lab to get him 
to fix it.  But what happens instead is that 
hundreds of Game Boy-like systems are created, 
with no buttons and an addictive tilt control!  
Wario's gonna be even richer than ever before when 
he sells this! 
 
WarioWare Twisted! is the sequel to the sleeper 
hit WarioWare Inc.: Mega: Microgame$!.  It 
includes a built-in rumble pack and gyro sensor 
which the games have been designed around.  Over 
two hundred five second games are hurled at the 
player as they make their way through the stage, 
trying to figure out what to do with a short 
description like "Play!", "Avoid!" or "Digest!".  
Each stage has a random game thrown at you, with a 
short time to complete it.  Fail it, and you lose 
one of your four lives.  Lose all four and it's 
game over.  Pass enough games, and you'll get told 
"FASTER!" and the games start coming at you at a 
quicker speed.  Finally, you'll encounter a Boss 
Stage, which has no time limit and is tougher to 
beat. 
 
Each character's stage is based around a different 
'theme'.  Mona's games require you to make only a 
small spin to pass them, Jimmy T.'s games need a 
consistent rhythm to play, Kat and Ana's games 
simply need the use of the A Button, Dr. Crygor's 
games involve changing gravity itself, while the 
Nintendo nerd pair 9-Volt and 18-Volt have a set 
of Nintendo games which use all of the different 
styles of play from the other game sets. 
 
Twisted! also has a huge amount of novelty 
unlockables to collect.  Once you've played 
through Story Mode, you can replay the games again 
for a higher score and bonus toys.  Whenever you 
beat a Boss Game after completing Story Mode once, 
you'll be prompted to spin to get a bonus prize.  
This prize could be as simple as a light wand that 
you shake to see a picture, or a small 
arcade-style game involving sewing or rolling a 
cat around the floor while shooting bugs.

Watman (c) 2002 
 
This remake of Batman adds new color graphics and 
sounds to the isometric action-adventure from 
1986. As in the original, the player controls 
Batman (renamed to "Watman" to avoid litigation) 
in his quest to assemble the hovercraft and rescue 
Robin. The batcave is filled with bizarre 
creatures and surreal rooms, where dangerous 
roaming enemies have to be avoided and hazardous 
environments must be navigated to collect all the 
vehicle pieces and finish the main goal. 
 
Watman can only use his special abilities after 
finding and equipping one of his famous gadgets. 
The boots allow him to jump, the bag lets him 
carry objects, the thruster gives horizontal 
control when falling and the belt slows the speed 
of descent. Other items give temporary powers, 
like energy pellets that increase Watman's speed, 
shields that make the hero invulnerable for a 
short time, spring boots for higher jumps, a 
Batman doll that gives an extra life and a 
neutralizer that removes all powers. 
 
Some rooms have batsignals that provide a 
rudimentary way of saving progress, allowing the 
player to resume from that point after losing all 
lives. The PC remake has the ability to save the 
game at any place with the F2 key, and load it 
later from the main menu. Batman loses one life 
with each save, and the player can't use this 
function when the number of remaining lives is 
zero.

Whac-A-Mole (c) Sep 28, 2005 DC Studios, Inc. / 
Activision Value Publishing, Inc. 
 
This is an adaption of the arcade game 
Whac-A-Mole, for Nintendo's handheld devices. At 
the screen you have a 5x4 grid of holes (3x3 in 
the GBA version). As the game begins, moles will 
randomly pop up their heads in the holes. Now you 
have to hit them before they disappear again. DS 
users will use the stylus and tap the moles, while 
GBA users will have to use the directional pad to 
move a marker around the screen. 
 
The game comes with three different game modes. 
The first is the arcade mode, were you for each 
level has to reach a certain amount of points 
before the time goes out. Different types of mole 
will show up. In addition to the standard mole, 
there's the golden mole which gives four times as 
much points as the standard one, and the plush one 
which gives minus points. Later in the game, you 
will also meet moles that attack your score, for 
example ninja and bazooka moles. Various power ups 
are also available. We have the multipliers, which 
 once active will give you double points for each 
mole, clocks that slows the time and bombs that do 
the opposite. Seven worlds are available, each 
with it's own graphical theme. 
 
The second mode is the puzzle mode, which isn't 
the same on both platforms. In the DS version you 
have to recreate a shape that is shown on the 
upper screen. This is done by tapping moles of 
different colors. The GBA version has two puzzle 
games. One is a Tic Tac Toe where you have to hit 
three moles in a row before your opponent does so. 
The other is the Peg Puzzle where you have to 
empty the field from all moles. For each mole you 
remove, more moles will appear on the screen. The 
moles will have arrows around them, indicating 
where the new moles will pop up. However, there 
won't come any new moles if there already is a 
mole in that location. 
 
The third mode is a simple quick play mode where 
you just specify how many levels you want to play 
and with what difficulty and then try to be 
successful. The DS version also supports a 
multiplayer mode.

Wing Commander - Prophecy (c) Jun 04, 2003 ORIGIN 
Systems, Inc. / Destination Software, Inc. 
 
Following the Border Worlds conflict of Wing 
Commander IV, the galaxy is once more at peace. 
Colonel Christopher Blair, hero of the 
Confederation has transferred into the Naval 
Forces. Blair helps design the TCS Midway, a 
state-of-the-art multi-role carrier that will help 
keep order during the Confederation's new 
peacetime. The luxury of peace allows Confed to 
retire many older pilots and assign younger pilots 
to piloting roles. Lance Casey and his friend Max 
"Maestro" Garrett are two such pilots, fresh from 
the academy, transferred aboard the TCS Midway 
along with several others for its maiden voyage 
along the borders of Confed Space. But soon into 
the mission, the Midway intercepts a distress call 
from the Kilrathi, the remains of a race of 
cat-like warriors who lost the war with the 
Confederation... 
 
Wing Commander: Prophecy is a space combat 
simulator. Players take the role of Lance Casey on 
his new assignment aboard the ship. The player can 
click various hotspots aboard the ship to engage 
in non-interactive FMV conversations with 
shipboard personnel. By entering the briefing 
room, players can receive full instructions on 
their next mission. 
 
Space Combat begins by launching from the TCS 
Midway carrier, and are displayed as first-person 
perspective inside the cockpit, similar to the 
rest of the Wing Commander series. Mission 
objectives vary between escort duties, patrol 
missions, search and destroy or defense of the TCS 
Midway herself. Depending on the ship being flown 
for the particular mission, the player will be 
able to switch between guns, missiles, torpedoes 
and mines with which to combat the enemy. The 
player, as wing commander, can give orders to 
nearby wingmen and communicate with any other 
ship. After each mission, the player must return 
to dock with the TCS Midway and will receive a 
mission performance rating.

Metro3D, Inc. 
 
You are an allied fighter pilot in WW1, duking it 
out with the "Huns" up in the sky in over 200 
missions. 
 
The missions usually come in three flavors: 
Top-down view bombing missions where you have to 
take out strategically important targets, 
isometric strafing runs where you get to blast 
anything that you fancy blasting with an unlimited 
supply of ammo, and of course the main part: 
Dogfights in the sky. Rendered in 3D, seems from 
behind your head. 
 
The game is set in the years 1916 through 1918, 
and to loosen things up a little, we get to read a 
page of our character's new entry for the 
diary-like journal in his company between every 
mission.

The game plays (and given the limitations, feels) 
like the PSOne versions of the series. Gameplay 
was tweaked to allow playing with only four 
buttons, making some actions such as lobbing only 
accessible through double taps on the passing 
button, for instance, but still retains the same 
attention to ball movement and focus on accurate 
passing as the "big" versions. Graphically, player 
sprites are pretty much alike the polygonal 
models, with a lot of similar movements. 
 
Game modes include Friendly, League mode, Cup

Winx Club (c) Nov, 2005 DC Studios, Inc. / Konami 
Digital Entertainment, Inc. 
 
Winx Club is an action adventure game based on the 
Italian cartoon series of the same name. The story 
is similar to that of Harry Potter, only this time 
the main character is a fairy. She gets to go to a 
fairy school in fairytale world called Magix where 
she has to find her true self. This game is 
similar to the Windows and Playstation 2 versions, 
except that instead of a 3D third person 
perspective it features a 2D top-down perspective 
of the game world. 
 
This game loosely retells the story of the first 
season of the television series. 
 
There are "action" and "adventure"levels. In the 
adventure levels gameplay consists of finding 
items for specific NPCs and playing various 
mini-games. In the action levels the player has to 
jump, climb and fight enemies. The main character, 
Bloom, has a magic shield and two attacks that 
improve during the game. She can also cast a 
number of spells that can aid her in finding the 
items she needs. During boss battles Bloom changes 
to her Winx form in which she is more powerful and 
can fly. During the levels there are various items 
to be picked up which improve Blooms health or 
attacks or unlock new outfits that can be worn.

Wolfenstein 3D (c) Apr 02, 2002 id Software, Inc. 
/ BAM! Entertainment, Inc. 
 
Inspired by the top-down infiltration game Castle 
Wolfenstein, this episodic first-person shooter 
(FPS) puts the player in the boots of  B.J. 
Blazkowicz, an allied spy. There are six episodes 
(the first distributed complete as shareware), the 
second, and the third available after registration 
and the three final missions (which happen before 
the events of the first episode) available in the 
"Nocturnal Missions" pack. However, they do not 
need to be played in sequence to be enjoyed! 
 
In the first episode (Escape from Wolfenstein), 
B.J. was captured, but overpowered a guard with 
the help of a concealed knife and managed to get 
out of his cell. Throughout the next nine levels 
the player guides B.J. searching for an escape 
from Wolfenstein, guarded by Hans Grosse. After 
returning to Allied territory, B.J. is given the 
instructions to Operation: Eisenfaust, where he 
has to stop Dr. Schabbs and his army of mutant 
prototypes before they are released into the 
battlefields. The final mission (Die, Führer, 
Die!) has a simple goal: infiltrate the bunker 
under the Reichstag, and terminate Hitler (in a 
robotic suit) himself. The Nocturnal Missions are 
focused on the Nazi plans for chemical warfare, 
and start with Dark Secret, where B.J. hunts for 
lead researcher Dr. Otto Giftmacher. It's followed 
by Trail of the Madman, where the goal is 
capturing the war plans guarded by Gretel Grosse, 
and the final episode Confrontation, where B.J. 
meets General Fettgesicht, the planner for the 
chemical assault. 
 
Each episode has nine levels (eight regular and a 
final boss level), plus a secret level activated 
by an hidden switch somewhere in the eight first 
levels. Regular levels often feature a maze-like 
appearance or large areas with many enemies (the 
number of them on each area depends on the 
difficulty level), where the player must reach the 
exit elevator. To do so, he must kill the enemies 
(while it's possible to move behind the guards' 
backs and even there's a slight bonus in attacking 
them from behind, most enemies have to be dealt 
with by fire power), and depending on the level, 
activate "push walls" and/or get silver and golden 
keys to open certain doors. 
 
Many objects can be found in a level, from 
medikits, chicken meals, and even dog food (to 
restore health), ammo and treasures, which solely 
exist for points. There are four weapons (knife, 
pistol, machine gun and Gatling), all of them 
using the same bullets except the knife. The knife 
and the pistol are given at the start of the 
level, while the machine gun is either found 
(usually in secret areas) or picked up from SS 
troopers and the Gatling is always dropped 
somewhere in the level. There are five kinds of 
enemies (excluding bosses) - Dogs (fast, but more 
a nuisance than life-threatening), Army Soldiers 
(dressed in regular brown outfit, not very 
powerful but usually found in large groups), 
Officers (dressed in white, armed with a very 
accurate pistol and tough to kill), SS Troopers 
(blue attire, armed with a machine gun and tough 
to kill), and Mutants (the rarest and toughest of 
regular enemies, pale-skinned troopers with green 
clothes and a machine gun stuck in their chest). 
 
Unlike modern FPS games, the player has a number 
of lives and once the player loses the last life, 
the game ends. To win extra lives, the player has 
to either find the 1-up item in the level or get 
20,000 points (by killing enemies and capturing 
treasures or completing a level below the 'par' 
time while killing all enemies, finding all 
secrets by pushing walls, and collecting all 
treasure points).

World of Dragon Warrior: Torneko: The Last Hope 
(c) Dec 20, 2001 Chunsoft Co., Ltd. / Enix 
Corporation 
 
Torneko: The Last Hope is the sequel to Torneko no 
Daibouken - Fushigi no Dungeon and like that game, 
stars Torneko (aka 
Taloon), the merchant from Dragon Warrior IV. 
Having become rich and properous in the previous 
game by collecting treasures, Torneko eventually 
recovered the "Joy Chest" from the very bottom of 
the dungeon and had it enshrined at his shop. 
Peace had returned to the town for some time. 
After awhile, a mysterious stranger arrived and 
seemed concerned about the Joy Chest being outside 
the dungeon. At the same time, monsters started 
reappearing and different parts of the kingdom 
began turning into "mysterious dungeons". It will 
be up to middle-aged Torneko, to fight through 
these strange places and help the king discover 
what has broken the peace. 
 
Like other Fushigi no Dungeon games, Torneko: The 
Last Hope is a dungeon crawler viewed from the 
overhead. The dungeons are randomly generated. 
When venturing into dungeons, Torneko will find 
many items and fight monsters. He can freely move 
through the dungeons, but each movement or action 
of his is countered by those of the monsters (if 
they are present on screen). All actions are made 
in turns, so despite the illusion of walking and 
fighting in real time, the game is turn-based. 
There are all kinds of items in the dungeons 
including herbs which can be eaten or thrown, 
magic scrolls which can be read, swords and 
shields that can be equipped and staffs which can 
be waved until their charges are depleted. Players 
must also keep an eye on Torneko's hunger meter 
and eat regularly, otherwise Torneko will go into 
starvation and start losing hitpoints at a great 
rate. 
 
There are several ways to leave a dungeon 
including death, an Outside Scroll, donating to a 
Priest or reaching the very bottom floor. When 
leaving the dungeon areas, Torneko's experience 
points and stats are lost. To make money, he must 
sell items he has collected from the dungeon, but 
may keep a couple of his items in the Storage Room 
for later use. Torneko's village initially starts 
small, but as progress in made in the game more 
and more services and shops will be attracted to 
it. Some examples of services include a Bread 
Baker, a Witch, a Blacksmith, a Builder and a 
Meldersmith.

have to tilt the world to help Yoshi climb walls, 
open new paths, and send enemies rolling away. You 
will earn Happiness Medals that will allow you to 
move on to the next chapter if you clear certain 
objectives that the Spirits ask of you. 
 
Along the way, Yoshi will be transformed into a 
ship, a ball, and a balloon. With the tilt sensor, 
this is a platform game like no other on the GBA.

Yu-Gi-Oh! - Reshef of Destruction (c) Jun 29, 
   2004 Konami Computer Entertainment Japan, Inc. 
   / Konami Digital Entertainment, Inc. 
 
Reshef the Dark Being has been released by someone 
who fused the three Egyptian God Cards.  This has 
caused the cards to be turned to stone and all the 
Millennium pieces are now missing.  It is up to 
Yugi, Joey, and you to find these pieces and the 
cards in order to stop Reshef before he plunges 
the world into darkness. 
 
There are more than 100 duelists to duel with to 
help you gain the cards needed for a deck powerful 
enough to defeat Reshef.  Build up your duelist 
level so you can have more powerful cards in your 
deck.  Buy, sell, and wager cards in order to 
improve your deck.  With over 800 cards and the 
three Egyptian God cards, you can personalize your 
deck however you choose. 
 
Use the Link cable to duel friends, trade cards, 
and improve your skill level, or just duel the 
opponents in the game itself.  The choice is 
yours. 
 
The game is played through with a storyline rather 
than just dueling.  This helps to move things 
along and keep the player interested.  You must 
defeat Reshef.  Can you do it?

You are a young boy destined to be the greatest 
duelist of all time. You start with one of three 
starter decks. You battle duelists in 5 different 
levels. Along the way you live in real time. Which 
means, if you duel once, one day will pass on the 
calendar. If you get this far, you could 
tournaments in certain months. Plus, you can 
unlock new booster packs with new cards. 
Basically, it is a usual Yu-Gi-Oh! card game. This 
game is only for the Game Boy Advance.

Yu-Gi-Oh! - The Sacred Cards (c) Nov 04, 2003 
   Konami Corporation / Konami Corporation 
 
Yu-Gi-Oh and friends are here for a tournament 
   hosted by Kaiba Corporation.  You must obtain 6 
   locater cards in order to get into the 
   tournament.  To obtain these cards, you must 
   battle various people around the city.  As you 
   battle the duelists, you have the opportunity 
   to gain new cards (if you win), or lose cards 
   (if you lose).  There is also a card shop if 
   you want to buy cards rather than using only 
   what you get from antes. 
 
The battles are played just like the in trading 
card game.  You use your cards' effects and 
strengths to defeat the other players' cards.  By 
lowering their life points to 0, you will defeat 
them. 
 
A feature in this game is your duelist level.  
Cards have certain levels on them.  If your 
duelist level is below that number, you cannot 
have that card in your deck.  This is a new 
feature not seen in previous games.  This feature 
keeps you from just buying all the best cards at 
the start and having an easy time for the rest of 
the game.  By winning duels, you will gain in 
level quickly enough to start using some of the 
better cards, though it will still take some time 
to be able to use the best cards. 
 
Can you get into the tournament and win the 3 
Egyptian God cards?  Yu-Gi-Oh and his friends are 
also trying to get into the tournament.  So you'll 
have to beat them in the tournament to win 
everything. 
 
With over 900 cards and over 100 duelists, you 
will have plenty to do in this game.

Yu-Gi-Oh! - World Championship Tournament 2004 
   (c) Feb 11, 2004 Konami Computer Entertainment

Yu-Gi-Oh! returns in the form of a Tournament 
   edition which will be used in an official 
   Worldwide Tournament in 2004 in Los Angeles.  
   The game also has a text translation utility 
   that will allow gamers who link with one 
   another to translate text automatically between 
   languages.  The languages included are 
   Japanese, French, Spanish, German, Italian, and 
   English.  These are also the languages you can 
   view the game in. 
 
The game continues the tradition of the Yu-Gi-Oh! 
card battles.  There is little to the game other 
than battling your opponents.  This game is a 
sequel to Yu-Gi-Oh! Worldwide Edition: Stairway to 
the Destined Duel and offers more than 1000 cards 
to use as well as new opponents.  The game takes 
out some of the non-card battling features from 
the Worldwide Edition and leaves you with the 
battling as the main feature of the game. 
 
Build up to three decks with the cards you gain as 
you work to beat all your opponents.  With over 
1000 cards, you will have a wide range of choices 
for your 40-card decks. 
 
As with the Worldwide Edition, you can also trade 
your cards with friends through the Link Cable.

Yu-Gi-Oh! - Worldwide Edition (c) Apr, 2003 
   Konami Computer Entertainment Japan, Inc. / 
   Konami of America, Inc. 
 
The Worldwide Edition of Yu-Gi-Oh! is another 
chance to play Yu-Gi-Oh! on the Gameboy Advance.  
The main point of the game is to allow you to 
battle others with your Yu-Gi-Oh! deck.  You 
choose to move to the next area or stay in your 
current area of the map and battle whoever is 
there. 
 
When you are in the map mode, you have the option 
of staying where you are and battling anyone in 
your area who will battle, or moving to an area 
adjacent to your own.  To help you decide what to 
do, the map will show you the people in your space 
and the spaces around your space.  Depending on 
what is shown to you, you can easily tell if each 
person wants to talk to you or battle you.  If you 
have not battled a person yet, you will not be 
able to see who they are until you choose to 
battle them (except with a small number of people 
you already know to start the game). 
 
Each week you can get 5 more cards through a 
magazine that you are given.  If you choose to, 
you can add these to your deck right away.  
Otherwise, you can leave them in your trunk to be 
added later. 
 
Each weekend, you can participate in a tournament 
if you're in the right location that weekend to do 
so.  Winning the tournaments can gain you some new 
cards by opening up new (locked) booster packs of 
cards that you can choose from when you win 
battles. 
 
As you get more cards, Duelist Points, or just win 
many times against a single opponent, you will 
also open up more booster packs to choose from 
when winning duels. 
 
The game also allows for dueling friends using a 
link cable, or even trading cards with friends.

Classic NES Series - Zelda II - The Adventure of 
Link (c) Oct 26, 2004 Nintendo Co., Ltd. / 
Nintendo of America Inc. 
 
The first of many sequels to The Legend Of Zelda. 
Link has just turned 16, and discovers a strange 
birthmark on his hand. With the help of Impa, 
Zelda's nursemaid, Link discovers this mark is the 
key to unlock a secret room where Princess Zelda 
lies sleeping. When young, Princess Zelda was 
given knowledge of the Triforce of power which was 
used to rule the kingdom of Hyrule, but when a 
magician unsuccessfully tried to find out about 
the Triforce from Zelda, he put her into an 
eternal sleep. In his grief, the prince placed 
Zelda in this room hoping she may wake some day. 
He ordered all female children in the royal 
household to be named Zelda from this point on, so 
the tragedy would not be forgotten. Now, to bring 
Princess Zelda back, Link must locate all the 
pieces of the Triforce which have been hidden 
throughout the land. 
 
Each piece of the Triforce is in a temple guarded 
by a powerful monster which must be defeated. At 
the same time, Ganon's underlings are still around 
and gaining in strength and number. It is said 
Ganon could be brought back to life by sprinkling 
the blood of the one who defeated him on the ashes 
(Link!). 
 
Zelda II: The Adventure of Link is a hybrid 
action/RPG game. The gameplay alternates between a 
top-down view (when traveling the land) and 
side-scrolling perspectives (when fighting, in a 
temple, or town). In the top-down view, Link 
cannot do much except for walking: in the 
side-scrolling action view, however, he can fight, 
cast spells, collect items and talk to people. 
 
When Link encounters an enemy in the wilderness, 
or enters a location which contains enemies, he 
can fight them with his sword. If Link is at full 
health, his sword can be thrown, but when he is 
hurt, he can only fight in melee. Link has a 
shield which protects him against some of the 
enemies' attacks if they strike the shield. 
Touching an enemy or getting hit by their attacks 
decreases Link's health. Link can replenish his 
health completely by encountering a fairy in the 
wilderness, or by using the services of a healer 
in a town. 
 
Link also has a "magic" meter. He can cast spells 
(as long as he learned them first) if he has some 
magic left. Spells cost a various amount of magic. 
They have various effects: they cure Link, allow 
him to jump very high, shoot fireballs etc. Magic 
can be refilled by collecting blue and red jars 
sometimes left behind by enemies. 
 
When Link slays an enemy, it might leave behind an 
item, or give Link some experience. When Link 
gains enough experience, he gains a level, which 
allows him to buy weapon power/maximum 
magic/maximum health upgrades for his experience 
points, or he can decide not to buy anything and 
stockpile his experience points for later use. 
 
There are some items to be found that are 
necessary to get past certain points in the game. 
The Adventure of Link features a battery backup so 
games can be saved without the need for passwords.

Zoids Legacy (c) Sep 15, 2004 Amedio Co., Ltd. / 
Atari, Inc. 
 
On the planet Zi, far away in the universe, there 
are both good and evil inhabitants. To gain 
control of the planet, they use mechanized robots 
called Zoids to battle for control of the world. 
During an experiment, Zoids warriors from 
different eras, the Chaotic Century and the New 
Century, collide. Players take control of Zoids 
warrior Zeru, who wants to restore the chaos with 
the help of his friends Van, Fiona and Bit Cloud. 
There are different types of Zoids to choose from, 
and each one of them can be upgraded and 
customized. 
 
Zeru is given a simple robot and has to 
participate in tournaments to earn money and 
collect new ones. He gets to meet Juno who gets 
kidnapped and a man called Dr. T tells him about 
the fusion that brought past, present and future 
together. By fighting in turn-based battles (with 
up to six-to-six match-ups), the player collects 
crystals left behind by defeated Zoids that can be 
turned into new ones by visiting the lab in one of 
the many towns. There, the robots can be upgraded 
too in different areas, with defensive and 
offensive elements, for both long-ranged and melee 
combat. Prior to each match players define the 
deck command. This affects the entire team, 
influencing the cash, salvaged parts or offering 
the possibilities to fuse all Zoids into a large 
creature. Each turn offers the player to attack, 
wait (and regenerate) or use an item. Some Zoids 
are accompanied by organoids, robot friends, that 
can fuse into the main Zoid for enhanced 
abilities. 
 
The main story mode takes place in 40 villages 
with 151 base Zoids to collect. There is also a 
challenge mode with consecutive, increasingly 
difficult battles, and multiplayer through the 
link cable. Except for fighting, this mode can 
also be used to trade Zoids and parts.

Zone of The Enders - The Fist of Mars (c) Feb 26, 
2002 Konami Computer Entertainment Japan Co., Ltd. 
/ Konami Digital Entertainment, Inc. 
 
In the distant future, mankind is at the brink of 
war with it's colonies on the moon, Mars and 
Jupiter. You take control of a young man who, 
after a series of events, finds himself in 
possession of a new type of L.E.V. (a giant combat 
robot) and stranded on Mars, where he joins forces 
with the Anti-Terrestrial League. 
 
Gameplay alternates between Story sequences and 
tactical turn-based combat in which you control a 
number of L.E.V.s on a square grid map. There are 
different types of L.E.V.s that differ in speed, 
durability, movement range and armament. Unlike 
close ranged weapons, long range weapons cannot be 
used after an L.E.V. has already been moved. When 
two units engage in combat, the I.A.S. 
(interactive action system) comes into play. When 
attacking, you have a limited amount of time to 
move a cross-hair over your target. Critical hits 
can be delivered by successfully aiming at certain 
weak-spots of your enemies. When attacked by an 
enemy, you must try to keep your own target icon 
away from the enemy's. The IAS can be toggled on 
and off in the options menu. 
 
At the end of each chapter, you can upgrade your 
L.E.V.s or equip them with certain items that can 
sometimes be found during missions. In the 
"balance" sub-screen, you can determine whether an 
L.E.V. should focus on attack power or accuracy, 
evasion or minimizing damage.

ZooCube (c) Jun 30, 2002 Puzzlekings / Acclaim

ZooCube is a puzzle game that involves matching

The Cube is a 3D object in the center of the 
screen and the animal parts fall towards it. In a 
similar style to Tetris the player must keep the 
sides from building too high. It is a quickly 
paced, real-time game and at later stages the 
player struggles to juggle the cube items to keep 
eliminating animals on all sides. Power-ups can be 
used to destroy animal parts, get points, or to 
make life more difficult for the player's 
opponents, such as by speeding up the rate at 
which animal parts fall to their cube, or reduce 
how fast their cube can spin.

The zoo animals have revolted against the zoo

In this colorful and fast-paced match-up game, 
players select animals of the same type using

Line like animals up in rows by swapping them from 
spot to spot in the time allowed. 
 
There are 5 varied game play modes: Normal, 
Tokoton, Quest, Time Attack and 2P.  Normal mode 
has you clearing a set amount of animals each 
level before progressing to the next.  Tokoton is 
similar to Normal, but has all the animal amounts 
set to 100 before you'll level up.  Quest has you 
playing ten set stages with specific goals (such 
as only capturing animals of a certain type) that 
you must attempt to achieve.  Time Attack has you 
aiming to get the highest score possible in the 
time limit.  2P has two players battling it out

Dragon Ball: Advanced Adventure follows the 
exploits of young Goku as he sets out for the 
first time to seek the legendary Dragon Balls. 
Based on the earliest manga chapters (before the 
series turned into Dragon Ball Z series), players 
fight their way through platform levels, bashing 
countless goons and bosses inspired by pivotal 
events and characters from the series. 
 
While the game's levels are straightforward 
brawls, special duels and tournament sequences 
play like classic fighting games, albeit with 
simplified controls. Goku can punch, kick and use 
his magic staff. After a certain point in the 
game, getting the Flying Nimbus, he receives the 
ability to engage into air combat. After 
completing the story mode, duel characters become 
available for customizable one-on-one bouts. 
Additional characters and mini-games can be 
unlocked by satisfying special requirements, e.g. 
completing the story mode unlocks Goku's fiend 
Krillin as a playable character.

With the construction of Jimmy Neutron's latest 
invention, he accidentally teleports himself into 
an alternate dimension, switching places with the

his home town, Retroville!  Jimmy will need to 
travel between different dimensions to make his 
way home and confront Negatron himself. 
 
In The Adventures of Jimmy Neutron: Boy Genius Vs. 
Jimmy Negatron, you control Jimmy Neutron as he 
battles his evil alter ego, Jimmy Negatron, to try 
and put Retroville back to normal.  The game is 
presented in a 3rd Person perspective using Mode 7 
(similar to Super Mario Kart) and pre-rendered 
graphics to give the illusion that the player is 
in a fully 3D world.  As Jimmy travels through 
eleven different dimensions, he uses many 
different gadgets including the shrink ray, the 
robot disassembling ray, the dimension jump ray, 
the rocket ship and, of course, his robot dog, 
Goddard. 
 
The game also features two different multiplayer 
games: War of Electrons and Collecting Coins, both 
which can be played with up to two players.

with a total of 20 different locations to fish for 
catfish, crappies and the game's namesake, the Big

different lures, spinner, swisher, minnow, rubber 
jig, worm, frog, crankbait, and spinnerbait, while 
using a fish finder to locate the best spot for 
fishing.

changes that will either help or hinder their 
fishing with three different game modes to choose 
from.  Quick Fish instantly takes the player to a 
spot with a lure already available to them.  
Practice lets the players learn the basics of the 
game with the main mode being Tournament where the 
player must progress through the lakes, unlocking 
them as they do, by catching up to five fish that 
will be kept in the livewell.  In the tournament 
mode, the player must adhere to rules and 
regulations and complete their fishing within a 
certain time limit, failure to do so will result 
in a disqualification.

four players to go against each other using the

Astro Boy - Tetsuwan Atom (c) Aug 17, 2004 
Hitmaker|Treasure Co., Ltd. / SEGA of America, 
Inc. 
 
Astro Boy: Omega Factor is a side-scrolling action 
game based off a 2003 remake of Osamu Tezuka's 
classic Astro Boy anime and manga series from the 
1960s. You play as the young, boylike robot Astro 
Boy, a true mechanical pacifist who's biggest 
dream is that one day humans and robots can 
coexist in peace. Armed with a strong punch, 
rocket powered feet and the ability to shoot 
laserbeams from your fingers, arms and behind, you 
set off on a quest against all sorts of evildoers 
from the Astro Boy series. 
 
The game has two distinctive types of levels: the 
more prevalent beat-em-up levels and the 
shooter-esque levels. During the beat-em-up levels 
you can walk around freely and your flying ability 
is limited to short bursts. The shooter levels 
differ from each other: sometimes you can float 
around the screen and shoot in both directions, 
other times you are flying in a set direction in a 
more on-the-rails fashion. 
 
The Omega Factor mentioned in the title is 
actually a simple upgrading system for your 
weapons. Every time Astro meets someone new (be 
they good or bad) he or she will be added to the 
Omega factor screen and Astro can upgrade one of 
his six weapons or abilities.

Crawfish Interactive Ltd. / BAM! Entertainment,

Much the same as the first title, Ballistic is a 
1st person shooter at heart, where you play as 
ex-FBI agent Ecks and former NSA operative Sever. 
You must progress through the game as either of 
the two main characters, gunning down the bad guys 
along your intended path while also using the 
latest spy gear to your advantage in gaining 
access to certain areas and avoiding hazards. 24 
missions await you, based in locations around the 
world. 
 
The story takes place after the events of the 
first title, where Ecks originally tried to hunt 
down Sever. Here, they work together to discover 
the secrets behind a worldwide weapon cartel, and 
only they can shut it down before things get out 
of hand. 
 
Two player co-operative campaigns add to the 
package, where you'll play as both characters 
through a number of missions. Up to four can 
compete in Deathmatch, capture the flag and many 
other multiplayer modes.

Bokura no Taiyou (c) Sep 16, 2003 Konami JPN / 
Konami of America, Inc. 
 
Following in his father's footsteps, you play 
Django the vampire hunter, who uses the power of 
the sun to defeat the many evil beings that infest 
the world. Search out the various levels for the 
evil inside, and destroy the immortal that rules 
the area to complete the level. 
 
This isometric platformer does not have you 
fighting evil with the usual assortment of weapons 
and devices, but it will have you playing 
outdoors. The inbuilt sunlight sensor on the 
cartridge detects levels of sunlight, which 
determines not only the time of day you play, but 
also acts as ammo for your weapon. Run out of 
sunlight, or play in the dark, and evil will have 
the upperhand. 
 
Many elements to the sunlight can have an effect 
on how the game plays out. For example, you can 
only replenish ammo during play by standing 
outside or, if indoors, under light from a window. 
Sunlight batteries can be collected during play to 
store sunlight, so you can play at night.

Capcom Co., Ltd. / Capcom Entertainment, Inc. 
 
Ryu was a young boy who has memories of a strange 
village far away and a magical doorway which 
sucked him through. However those are only distant 
memories. Ryu and his best friend Bow are 
apprentices in the Ranger's Guild. As adventurers 
they take on posted jobs needed by the 
townspeople. However it isn't long before one job 
goes awry and Bow is accused of stealing a 
valuable item. In order to clear his friend's name 
and find the meaning of his dreams, Ryu will 
explore the world, eventually discovering the 
meaning of his dreams and hidden abilities inside 
himself. 
 
Breath of Fire II is a role playing game. The 
majority of game is played from a top-down map, 
however battles are seen from an isometric view. 
Ryu will form parties from among 8 other 
characters, each with their own set of skills and 
powers that will help him discover the truth 
behind the mystery. 
 
In the GBA version, you can use a link-cable to 
link to a friends and exchange weapons and items 
to defeat the higher evils. And with the inclusion 
of the community system, you can build and 
maintain your own city while you are fed up of 
exploring.

Although set in the future, all of the weapons and

Soma can take the souls of his enemies and use 
their powers as his own, providing passive stat 
boosts, powerful magic, or even summoning them

souls to power abilities he can bypass obstacles 
that were previously insurmountable. Players can

Every hundred years, the dark vampire known as 
Dracula resurrects and terrorizes the land. A 
vampire hunter named Simon Belmont bravely 
ventures into the Count's mansion in order to 
defeat him. Along the way he'll have to defeat 
skeletons, bats, fishmen, medusa heads and other 
evil creatures. 
 
Castlevania is a side-scrolling platform action 
game. The player taking the role of Simon Belmont 
is able to jump and crack his whip directly in 
front of him. Power-ups can be obtained by 
defeating enemies or by whipping candles that 
appear in the castle. One such power-up increases 
the power and length of Simon's whip.  Different 
weapons can be gathered which consume hearts when 
used, these hearts can also be collected from 
monsters and candles. Additionally, some walls 
will hide secrets such as the health-restorative 
turkey or the Double and Triple shot abilities for 
the weapons Simon has collected. At the end of 
each section of the castle is a boss, which must 
be defeated. Progression through the castle 
eventually leads to a confrontation with Count 
Dracula himself.

Castlevania: Harmony of Dissonance is the second 
Castlevania game to appear on the Game Boy 
Advance. Juste Belmont and friend Maxim are drawn 
to the newly resurrected Dracula's Castle in order 
to save their mutual friend Lydie, although it 
remains to be seen who will be saving whom. 
 
The game is another Castlevania in the action/RPG 
style of the previous Castlevania: Symphony of the 
Night and Castlevania: Circle of the Moon. Juste 
is able to dash at will similar to Alucard, and 
use subweapons like the axe and holy water. By 
combining subweapons with magic tomes located 
throughout the castle he can increase both their 
power and their properties, such as turning the 
holy water into a rain that damages every monster 
onscreen, or turning a Bible into a holy shield 
that circles him. Juste can equip many kinds of 
armor and accessories, and he can modify his 
Vampire Killer whip with different tips that 
change its elemental property or increase its 
power. As an optional side quest, Juste can also 
find furniture and furnishings left around the 
castle and decorate a room with them, although 
there is no reward for doing so beyond a nice 
looking room.

Frontier Stories (c) Nov 18, 2003 Neverland Co., 
Ltd. / Natsume, Inc. 
 
The CIMA aliens feed on humankind hopes and 
dreams. They build elaborate mazes and trap people 
inside them as a way of producing their food. A 
force called "Gate Guardians" was created to 
protect the population from this menace. Three 
Guardians were on a train delivering settlers to a 
distant station, when suddenly a portal for 
another dimension appeared and transported 
everyone to a strange moon-like place. The 
Guardians must find the way home and bring back 
safely every passenger. 
 
CIMA: The Enemy is a RPG with strategic elements. 
Although labeled a RPG, the game doesn't have the 
usual trappings of the genre: there is no 
levelling up, nor any form of currency or shops to 
buy equipment. Instead, the game is focused on the 
management of a huge party of characters (16 by 
the end of the game). The main objective is to 
guide these civilians on mazes, using their unique 
abilities to overcome obstacles and defeat 
enemies. Each character has a special trait that 
can be used to the player's advantage (a medic 
that concots health potions, a blacksmith that 
upgrades armor and weapons, etc). 
 
Pressing the R button brings up a cross with the 
party portraits at each point and a multicolor 
cross on the middle. The characters can be 
individually guided by selecting their portraits 
or moved in groups by selecting the multicolor 
cross. Three way-points can be set for easier 
manouvering (almost a necessity, the characters 
have a tendency to get stuck on corners and 
walls). The groups to be moved can be selected by 
hitting the L button (a cross with numbered tents 
at each point appears). 
 
One crucial gameplay aspect is the amount of trust 
the party members have on their Guardians. Each 
character has a gauge that shows the amount of 
trust they have. This number increases and 
decreases according to actions within the game. If 
a character is hurt his/her trust decreases, and a 
red heart with an arrow pointing downwards appears 
over his/her head. Likewise, if a character sees a 
guardian slaying a monster the opposite effect 
happens, and a green heart with an upwards arrow 
appears over his/her head. Trust is important 
because the characters only cooperate with the 
Guardians when they have the right amount of it. 
 
Using the START button brings up a cross with the 
following functions: 
 
? The south point has a wrench icon. It accesses 
the game options menu that can save the game (at 
any time), quit it or change the text speed. 
 
? The north point has a face with a speech ballon 
icon. It is the dialogue screen, where the 
characters speak about the situation and how they 
are feeling. 
 
? The middle of the cross has a sword and a potion 
icon. It is the inventory screen, where potions 
and other items can be equipped on a cross. The 
main character's inventory cross can be accessed 
in-game by pressing the A button. The other 
characters use items automatically when needed 
(they don't equip them automatically, though). 
 
? The east point has a stylized file of people 
icon. This is the group screen, where characters 
can be organized in groups for easier management 
and manouvering. 
 
? The west point has a stylized body and heart 
icon. It is the statistics screen, where the 
player can check what weapons, stats and armor 
each character has. 
 
The top-left of the main game screen shows the 
health points bar of the main character. Below 
that occasionally is shown a health bar of any 
near party member being attacked. When a party 
character is about to expire, a jewel is displayed 
besides the main character's health bar, and an 
alarm sound is played. Death of any party member 
ends the game instantaneously.

Famicom Mini - Vol. 02 - Donkey Kong (c) Nov 11, 
2002 Nintendo Co., Ltd. / Nintendo of America Inc. 
 
Released in the arcades in 1981, Donkey Kong was 
not only Nintendo's first real smash hit for the 
company, but marked the introduction for two of 
their most popular mascots: Mario (originally 
"Jumpman") and Donkey Kong. 
 
Donkey Kong is a platform-action game that has 
Mario scale four different industrial themed 
levels (construction zone, cement factory, an 
elevator-themed level, and removing rivets from 
girders) in an attempt to save the damsel in 
distress, Pauline, from the big ape before the 
timer runs out.  Once the rivets are removed from 
the final level, Donkey Kong falls, and the two 
lovers are reunited.  From there, the levels start 
over at a higher difficulty. 
 
Along the way, Mario must dodge a constant stream 
of barrels, "living" fireballs, and 
spring-weights.  Although not as powerful as in 
other future games, Mario can find a hammer which 
allows him to destroy the barrels and fireballs 
for a limited amount of time.  Additionally, Mario 
can also find Pauline's hat, purse and umbrella 
for additional bonus points. 
 
Donkey Kong is also notable for being one of the 
first complete narratives in video game form, told 
through simplistic cut scenes that advance the 
story.  It should also be noted that in versions 
of the game for early 1980's consoles, Donkey Kong 
only used 2-3 of the original levels, with the 
cement factory usually omitted.

In the future, the Galactic Federation and the 
pirates of planet Zebes are at war. Pirates have 
stolen an unknown life-form, recently discovered 
on the planet SR388. The life-form, designated 
"Metroid", is in a state of suspended animation 
and, according to analysis, was the cause of the 
complete destruction of SR388. If the Metroid ever 
got loose, the alien could destroy countless other 
systems. It is up to the space bounty hunter Samus 
Aran to land on Zebes and find her way through the 
perilous terrains of Brinstar and Norfair, destroy 
the Pirates, as well as their alien enforcers, 
Ridley and Kraid, and rid the planet of the alien 
life form before the pirates complete their plans 
of world destruction. 
 
Using the cybernetic enhancements of her Power 
Suit, Samus can use a range of weapons and 
defenses to destroy the enemy. She can also absorb 
enemies powers into her Power Suit to increase her 
defense and chance of survival. Using her weapons 
and special abilities, she must find her way to 
the central chamber of Tourian and destroy the 
Mother Brain, the mysterious leader behind the 
Space Pirates.

One of the most popular and influential games of

dot-muncher who works his way around to clear a 
maze of the various dots and fruit which inhabit 
the board. 
 
Pac-Man's goal is continually challenged by 
   four ghosts: The shy blue ghost Bashful (Inky), 
   the trailing red ghost Shadow (Blinky), the 
   fast pink ghost Speedy (Pinky), and the 
   forgetful orange ghost Pokey (Clyde).  One 
   touch from any of these ghosts means a loss of 
   life for Pac-Man. 
 
Pac-Man can turn the tables on his pursuers by 
   eating of the four Energizers located within 
   the maze.  During this time, the ghosts turn 
   blue, and Pac-Man can eat them for bonus 
   points.  This only lasts for a limited amount 
   of time, as the ghost's eyes float back to 
   their center box, and regenerate to chase after 
   Pac-Man again. 
 
Survive a few rounds of gameplay, and be treated

ghosts.

of the Overworld to find the secret entrances of 
the eight dungeons in an attempt to piece together 
the broken Triforce. Once all pieces are joined, 
Link will be able to gain entry to Death Mountain, 
home of Ganon, and prison of Princess Zelda. 
 
The game is drawn in a top-down perspective. Link 
begins his quest in the Overworld, which features 
forests, mountains and lakes and is divided into 
several screens. Link can explore the Overworld 
freely, though when he enters a screen, he will 
encounter several enemies. He can attack them with 
his sword. If link is at full health, he can toss 
his sword to attack enemies from afar, but when he 
is hurt, even slightly, he can only fight in melee 
range. 
 
Link's health is represented by hearts

Famicom Mini - Vol. 25 - The Legend of Zelda 2 - 
Link no Bouken (c) Oct 26, 2004 Nintendo Co., Ltd. 
/ Nintendo of America Inc. 
 
The first of many sequels to The Legend Of Zelda. 
Link has just turned 16, and discovers a strange 
birthmark on his hand. With the help of Impa, 
Zelda's nursemaid, Link discovers this mark is the 
key to unlock a secret room where Princess Zelda 
lies sleeping. When young, Princess Zelda was 
given knowledge of the Triforce of power which was 
used to rule the kingdom of Hyrule, but when a 
magician unsuccessfully tried to find out about 
the Triforce from Zelda, he put her into an 
eternal sleep. In his grief, the prince placed 
Zelda in this room hoping she may wake some day. 
He ordered all female children in the royal 
household to be named Zelda from this point on, so 
the tragedy would not be forgotten. Now, to bring 
Princess Zelda back, Link must locate all the 
pieces of the Triforce which have been hidden 
throughout the land. 
 
Each piece of the Triforce is in a temple guarded 
by a powerful monster which must be defeated. At 
the same time, Ganon's underlings are still around 
and gaining in strength and number. It is said 
Ganon could be brought back to life by sprinkling 
the blood of the one who defeated him on the ashes 
(Link!). 
 
Zelda II: The Adventure of Link is a hybrid 
action/RPG game. The gameplay alternates between a 
top-down view (when traveling the land) and 
side-scrolling perspectives (when fighting, in a 
temple, or town). In the top-down view, Link 
cannot do much except for walking: in the 
side-scrolling action view, however, he can fight, 
cast spells, collect items and talk to people. 
 
When Link encounters an enemy in the wilderness, 
or enters a location which contains enemies, he 
can fight them with his sword. If Link is at full 
health, his sword can be thrown, but when he is 
hurt, he can only fight in melee. Link has a 
shield which protects him against some of the 
enemies' attacks if they strike the shield. 
Touching an enemy or getting hit by their attacks 
decreases Link's health. Link can replenish his 
health completely by encountering a fairy in the 
wilderness, or by using the services of a healer 
in a town. 
 
Link also has a "magic" meter. He can cast spells 
(as long as he learned them first) if he has some 
magic left. Spells cost a various amount of magic. 
They have various effects: they cure Link, allow 
him to jump very high, shoot fireballs etc. Magic 
can be refilled by collecting blue and red jars 
sometimes left behind by enemies. 
 
When Link slays an enemy, it might leave behind an 
item, or give Link some experience. When Link 
gains enough experience, he gains a level, which 
allows him to buy weapon power/maximum 
magic/maximum health upgrades for his experience 
points, or he can decide not to buy anything and 
stockpile his experience points for later use. 
 
There are some items to be found that are 
necessary to get past certain points in the game. 
The Adventure of Link features a battery backup so 
games can be saved without the need for passwords.

against arch nemesis, Dr. Neo Cortex. This time 
Cortex has shrunk the world down to a tiny size

crystals that will (hopefully) change the world 
back to its normal size. 
 
Crash explores 4 worlds, split into 5 levels. 
Levels range from side-scrolling action to 
underwater swimming and 3D chase sequences 
(similar to those in the original Playstation 
series) designed using the GBA's unique FX 
features to create a 3D illusion. You will also 
play flying shoot 'em up levels, a boss levels at 
the end of each world, and the usual extra bonus

CT Special Forces 2 - Back to Hell (c) Jun, 2003 
Light & Shadow Production / Light & Shadow 
Production 
 
CT Special Forces: Back to Hell is the sequel to 
CT Special Forces and the story picks up right 
where the last game ended. Having destroyed the 
terrorist group Network the CT Special Forces are 
going back to do training missions, but more and 
more reports about new terror threats keep popping 
up. Could this be a new terrorist organization, or 
maybe Network is back for a second round? It's up 
to the CT Special Forces to stop the treat of 
terrorism once again! 
 
The game plays in 5 different game modes. The 
majority is made up of side scrolling platform 
action, somewhat similar to the Metal Slug games, 
where you pick up various weapons, grenades and 
even a tank to squash the terrorist threat. Every 
now and then you'll come across a wooden sign with 
a cross-hair on it. Doing so will change the game 
into first person view, where you have to shoot 
terrorists and save hostages. Sometimes you'll 
find a parachute pack, and you'll have to play a 
mini game where you have to make two meters align 
to make a drop successfully with your parachute. 
 
There are also two kinds of helicopter stages. One 
is a top down shoot'em up, where you have to bomb 
land targets and gun down enemy helicopters. The 
other one is a side scrolling chopper rescue game, 
where you have to save hostages and bring them to 
your base, while gunning down enemies across the 
stage.

Set after the events of the 2002 movie, Disney's 
Lilo & Stitch lets players take control of the two 
lead characters in a variety of action adventure, 
shooter, and puzzle style levels. 
 
Hawaiian life is going well for the newly 
Earth-adjusted Stitch until a group of aliens, led 
by Dr. Pestus, kidnap Lilo and take her to their 
home planet.  Stitch resolves to save her, and 
gameplay shifts between the events of both Lilo 
and Stitch throughout eight levels. 
 
Stitch's levels are all shooter intensive, similar 
to games like Metal Slug for the side-scrolling 
levels, and Gyruss for the shooter levels.  In the 
side scrolling levels, Stitch blasts everything in 
his path with his laser pistols and pineapple 
bombs, until he is eventually able to  find a 
spaceship and continuing his rescue mission to the 
Junkyard Planet. 
 
Lilo's levels are set in an Out of the World or 
Flashback style, where Lilo must use stealth, 
solve puzzles, and use Scrump, her doll, to evade 
and confuse her alien captors. 
 
Once Lilo and Stitch find each other, they must 
escape via an alien tank to stop Dr. Pestus and 
escape back to Earth. 
 
Along the way, players can collect stills and 
small video clips featuring scenes from the movie. 
 The game uses a password save to continue where 
players left off.

Huey, Dewy and Louie went to hide in the attic to 
hide from their uncle Donald's temper when they 
came across a mysterious book.  Upon opening it, 
hand appears and kidnaps the boys into Storybook 
Land.  Now Donald Duck and his pal Mickey Mouse 
must go save the boys by defeating the evil King 
Pete! 
 
This game is for one to two players. You can 
choose to play as either Mickey Mouse or Donald 
Duck.  Options also include difficulty settings. 
 
The gameplay starts off much the way previous 
Magical Quest games have in that you jump on your 
enemies, spin them around, collect coins, etc.  
Later both Mickey and Donald will be given 
costumes that will give them special abilities.  
You will first receive a set of armor.  While 
Mickey receive a full knight's armor which 
includes a lance with a giant boxing glove at the 
end and a shield. Donald, however, gets a barrel 
and a hammer because his butt's too big for the 
armor. Both costumes has its pros and cons - for 
example, Donald's weapon can only be aimed forward 
while Mickey's can be aimed up/down/forward.  But, 
in water Mickey's armor will drag him down and 
sink while Donald's can float.  If playing with 
two players, these attributes can be used together 
so, for example, Mickey can take a ride on 
Donald's back across the water. 
 
In each stage, there are various hidden doors 
which will give you access to Bonus Games, shops 
and areas with coins and treasures. In a Bonus 
Game,  you will pick one of our three cards and 
unless you get the card with King Pete's picture, 
you will receive some sort of prize.  In the 
shops, you can purchase upgrades for your 
costumes, lives and hearts for your health meter.

Shin Sangoku Musou Advance (c) Aug 29, 2005 KOEI 
Co., Ltd. / Nintendo of America Inc. 
 
Dynasty Warriors Advance is a Game Boy Advance 
adaptation of the Dynasty Warriors franchise. 
Based on the "Three Kingdoms period" of ancient 
China,  it takes place at the end of the Han 
Dynasty during 190 A.D. As the previous government 
collapses, warlords rise up and fight among one 
another, eventually establishing three powerful 
kingdoms: Wei, Wu and Shu. Generals from each of 
these nations spend the next 100 years fighting 
among one another, each trying to become the 
dominant power. 
 
Dynasty Warriors Advance is a top-down turn-based 
strategy board game, but with a focus on action 
combat. Since it is based on the earlier Dynasty 
Warriors titles, many of the same concepts carry 
over. Players begin by choosing one of three 
available characters from the lands of either Wu, 
Shu or Wei. Each character has their own unique 
storyline and missions. A briefing is given for 
each mission detailing specific objectives before 
allowing the player to equip themselves with 
weapons and skills at the camp. Once begun, the 
player moves the designed number of spaces 
(determined by movement) around the "board". If an 
enemy player is encountered, the game shifts to a 
top-down action fighting mode. Here the player 
uses one button to attack, another button to 
charge and another to unleash a misou special 
attack once it is powered up. Misou energy is 
charged by successful attacking enemy units. The 
player's success against the enemy unit will 
determine the unit's "heath" and will be destroyed 
completely if all of it's units are destroyed. 
Some enemy units contain not just soldiers but 
enemy generals who have their own special moves 
and greater health. Many missions feature specific 
objectives rather than just defeating all enemies.

Golf Masters (c) Mar 21, 2001 KCE Nagoya / Kemco 
 
JGTO Kounin Golf Master: Japan Golf Tour Game is 
the first in the genre to appear on the GBA 
platform as one of the Japanese launch games. The 
game features 14 characters and multiple courses 
with different themes and with about 20 holes 
each. There is a match mode to go against 
AI-controlled players to beat their ranking or 
another mode for just one player. 
 
Gameplay is divided into two different parts. 
Players use a top-down overview to track the ball 
and the hole, while the putting and swinging is 
done from a third-person perspective. Taking the 
wind into account, players can choose from 
different clubs, determine the direction and 
finally the strength of the shot based on a moving 
bar requiring the player's timing for accuracy. 
Obstacles on the course such as sand or trees 
influence the shots and there are also different 
weather conditions. In the match mode games are 
announced by a TV anchor. The game keeps detailed 
statistics of the score and the player's handicap. 
Courses and new characters are unlocked gradually. 
 
Most of the game's content was later used in the 
US GBA game ESPN Final Round Golf 2002 with some 
minor differences.

Final Fantasy I & II Advance (c) Nov 29, 2004 
Square Enix Co., Ltd. / Nintendo of America Inc. 
 
The two titles that began the Final Fantasy 
Adventure return in an updated and improved 
portable form. Both titles feature updated visuals 
from their original NES origins and an improved 
translation of the story, filling in certain plot 
holes previously untold in other re-releases.  
Both games have also been rebalanced to require 
less "grinding," and feature gameplay fixes such 
as party members re-targeting a new enemy if the 
one they currently are targeting dies.  Players 
are also able to save at any point outside of 
combat (including dungeons) and return upon 
loading. 
 
As with other Final Fantasy titles, players take 
on the role of a group of four heroes out to save 
the world. Using a vast collection of spells, 
weapons, and potions, players will travel across 
the kingdom fighting a range of evil characters 
and gaining experience to increase strength and 
magic abilities. Final Fantasy I allows players to 
build their party out of six possible classes, 
with varying spells and stats.  Final Fantasy II 
brings more characterization to the party members, 
and builds their stats exclusively by constant use 
in battle. 
 
Both games get additional content in this version. 
 Final Fantasy I features four "Soul of Chaos" 
dungeons, unlocked during the course of the plot.  
These elemental dungeons are for high-level 
players, and feature a collection of bosses taken 
from later Final Fantasy games.  Final Fantasy II 
features an extra storyline known as the "Soul of 
Rebirth."  This mode is unlocked after completing 
the game and acts as an epilogue, featuring 
characters killed off in the main story.  Both 
games gain a Bestiary that tracks all the monsters 
the player has fought and their stats and 
weaknesses.

Eight hundred years ago, the sacred stones were 
used to defeat the Demon King. Sealing his soul 
inside the stones, peace was brought to the 
continent of Magvel and five nations were built 
around the power of the sacred stones. 
 
However, after 800 years of peace, the Grado 
Empire suddenly attacks his longtime ally Renais 
and a larger war threatens to break out. The 
player takes on the role of Prince Ephraim and his 
sister Princess Erika, two of the few survivors of 
Grado's attack, following their different paths 
through the story. 
 
Gameplay in Fire Emblem: The Sacred Stones is 
similar to its predecessors or the Advance Wars 
games. The player controls several different units 
in tactical turn-based battles. 
 
There are many different classes ranging from 
knights, thieves and archers to paladins, wyvern 
riders, great knights and more. As in RPGs, units 
receive experience points for their actions and 
may choose to upgrade to a different class once 
they reach a high enough level. 
 
A key element in Fire Emblem's gameplay are the 
three different types of weapons and magic. One 
type of weapon or magic is always strong against 
one, and weak against another type. 
 
During battles, it is also possible to visit 
stores to buy equipment, or houses to gain hints. 
 
Sometimes neutral units will also participate in 
battle. They can be convinced to join the player's 
army if the right person talks to them. 
 
Unlike most similar games, when a unit dies in 
battle it is impossible to revive it.

In this second version of the Fire Pro series in 
the GBA over 200 wrestlers are available, with the 
usual CAW mode allowing to increase that number by 
77. Along the Practice Dojo and the Exhibition 
match, the main mode is the Ironman road, where 
the initial roster of 10 wrestlers (11 once you 
finish training mode) is expanded as you beat your 
opponents one by one. Both Exhibition and Ironman 
Road feature match kinds such as Gruesome and 
Deathmatch (inside a electrified cage) with all 
assorted rule changes included. There's also the 
ability to play in a four-man Battle Royal. 
 
The CAW mode, one of the selling points of the 
original SNES titles, is as good as ever, allowing 
to create Wrestlers from scratch, personalizing 
them from how they look to how they fight, as well 
as trading them between federations.

Isaac is from the town of Vale, on the island of 
Angara. He is an Adept, meaning he is skilled in 
Psynergy, the technique of moving objects without 
touching them. Mages from the rival island of 
Gondowan plan to destroy Angara by using four 
Elemental Stones, so Isaac has assembled a team to 
snatch the stones. 
 
In the universe of this role-playing game, four 
different types of elements (fire, water, wind and 
earth) are combined to create spells. Combat often 
involves facing multiple monsters at each time. 
 
Djinni creatures can be captured and used to give 
one of your characters extra strengths. Energy is 
needed to cast spells, but this constantly 
replenishes while you are not using one. A 
two-player link-up game exists.

the player go through a series of matches, beating 
the other teams to become world champion with 
gameplay similar to the NBA Jam games. Each 
character has a range of statistics such as speed, 
offense, defense and stamina. All the regular 
moves are present: player switches, a tip off, 
passing, 1-2 passing, shooting, targetting, steals 
and dunks with hoop hanging. 
 
While playing, a stamina bar is shown. A temporary 
boost can be activated, but the amount will slowly 
decrease during the match and eventually 
substitutions may be needed. Another feature is 
the special bar, fed by impressive dunks and 
passes. When maxed out, players are able to 
perform special dunks. 
 
Progressing through the World Tour unlocks new 
teams. The DS version adds multiplayer support for

Harry Potter to Himitsu no Heya (c) Nov 15, 2002 
Eurocom Entertainment Software / Electronic Arts, 
Inc. 
 
The game for Game Boy Advance based on the second 
Harry Potter book and movie is, like its 
predecessor, an action adventure, this time with 
an isometric perspective. 
 
In Harry's second year at Hogwarts, bad things are 
happening. The ancient Chamber of Secrets has been 
opened, and what lurks within is attacking 
students. To get through this ordeal alive (and 
advance the plot) Harry must again complete 
various challenges. 
These mostly consist of navigating large mazes - 
fighting monsters, solving puzzles, flipping 
switches and pressing buttons for doors to open. 
Six spells are available to help. As Harry is 
often in places he shouldn't be, stealth sequences 
are also a large part of the game. To avoid 
teachers and prefects, he can sneak around slowly 
and hide behind curtains. If he is caught, he is 
thrown out (to try again) and house points can be 
deducted. 
 
As in other Potter games, there are a lot of 
collectibles, found both in plain view and in 
hidden areas. Sets of Famous Wizard cards unlock 
bonuses, Every Flavour Beans get Harry passwords 
that let him move through shortcuts in the school 
and Chocolate Frogs increase his maximum stamina. 
 
Finally, Quidditch is also back in this game, this 
time in three-dimensional space, viewed from the 
back.

find out why he is after Harry and what his 
connection to the death of Harry's parents is. 
 
The GBA version of Harry Potter and the Prisoner 
of Azkaban comes in form of a traditional RPG. In 
turn-based battles, Harry and his friends must use 
the right spells and items to defeat their 
enemies. Each character also has a few unique 
special attacks. Harry can perform magical attacks 
using the cards that can be collected throughout 
the game, Ron throws stink pellets and 
firecrackers at the enemy and Hermione can make 
the party's attacks more powerful. 
Outside of battles, you will take on quests and 
explore various dungeons. Inside dungeons, enemies 
are visible, so that it is possible to avoid 
combat. You will also need to use different spells 
to solve puzzles and clear obstacles.

Harry Potter to Kenja no Ishi (c) Nov 16, 2001 
Griptonite Games / Electronic Arts, Inc. 
 
The first Harry Potter game for the Game Boy 
Advance is an action adventure that lets you play 
as Harry in his first year at Hogwarts School of 
Witchcraft and Wizardry, following the story of 
the book and the movie. 
 
You control Harry from an overhead view and must 
complete several tasks. These range from mundane 
class assignments like collecting ingredients for 
a potion to facing off against a giant troll. To 
master these challenges, Harry can learn five 
spells that allow him to push back opponents, flip 
switches, open doors, levitate objects and more. 
If Harry is hurt, he can find and eat Bertie 
Bott's Every Flavor Beans to regain health. By 
performing admirably in learning spells and 
completing missions, Harry can gain extra House 
Points so that Gryffindor might win the House Cup. 
If he misbehaves by attacking other students, or 
being caught wandering the halls at night, points 
will be deducted, however. 
As seeker for the Gryffindor team, Harry must also 
compete in Quidditch matches. The game has a 
special mode for Quidditch and other events where 
Harry might have to mount his broom.

Following in the footsteps of Harvest Moon: 
Friends of Mineral Town, on this occasion you play 
the part of a young girl striving for a new life 
in the country. To do so, you have to build and 
maintain a farm while making friends with the 
locals, keeping a track of your funds and taking a 
closer look at your love life ... there's some 
bachelors out there waiting. 
 
The main aim of the game is to maintain your farm. 
To do so, you must plant and take care of various 
kinds of crops, keep your own home in order and 
feed the livestock. You'll have the opportunity to 
both buy and sell goods, since without money the 
farm will soon fall under. 
 
Making friends and attending various events in the 
town will also help to gain your character some 
extra items, more business and perhaps that life 
partner who can help you out, in more ways then 
one. 
 
More Friends of Mineral Town also connects to 
Harvest Moon: Another Wonderful Life, providing 
extra content for both titles through the game

Take on the role of Bilbo Baggins from J.R.R. 
Tolkien's "The Hobbit" in this GBA title.  The 
game follows the story told by Tolkien starting 
from when Bilbo meets Gandalf the wizard and gets 
talked into going on an adventure when a bunch of 
dwarves come to visit him for supper. 
 
Begin your journey to defeat Smaug, the dragon 
that has taken over the dwarves' home.  Find the 
One Ring as you meet Gollum.  Solve puzzles as you 
fight your way through many areas and meet many 
characters including elves. 
 
Battles are fought in real-time as you attack your 
enemies while trying to keep from being hit 
yourself.  Attacking can be done quickly, or you 
can attack more slowly to build up a more powerful 
attack.  Each way is useful depending on the 
situation.  Find many items to help you on your 
journey, including fireworks.

Mr. Incredible (c) Nov 01, 2004 Helixe / THQ 
    Inc. 
 
In the game based on the movie of the same name, 
you take control of Mr. Incredible when he is 
summoned to the island of Nomanisan for a secret 
assignment. The GBA version is a side-scrolling 2D 
beat-em-up. Initially, you can only play as Mr. 
Incredible but the other members of the family, 
along with Frozone, are playable in the later 
levels. The main buttons are used for basic 
attacks, combos and jumps, and the R button 
triggers special abilities known as 
"incredi-moves". Each member has a different 
special move: Mr. Incredible gets super strength, 
Dash runs faster, Violet has a force field and 
becomes invisible, and Helen can extend her arms. 
Using these depletes an additional meter on the 
screen. It is recharged by collecting icons and 
defeating enemies. 
 
Next to the icons used for incredi-moves, you can 
also collect band-aid to restore your health, 
extra lives, and frozone bottles. There are more 
than 30 levels, with a few chase sequences 
(playing as Dash), and familiar characters such as 
Syndrome, E and Bomb Voyage make an appearance. 
Both the enemies, carrying a variety of weapons, 
and the levels have a distinct hand-drawn, 
comic-book look, rather than mimicking the 3D 
visuals from the film. After completing a level, 
you receive a password to continue the next time.

Tokyo-to, a city not unlike Tokyo, somewhere in 
Asia, in the near future. This is the story about 
the GG's, one of three rival teenage gangs who 
ride motorised inline skates and are tagging the 
streets with graffiti. There is a turf war going 
on between the gangs GG's, the Poison Jam, and the 
high-tech freaks, the Noise Tanks. The evil 
Rokkaku Corporation has the corrupt police in 
their grasp, and, headed by Captain Onishima, the 
cops are hell-bent on subduing the unruly teen 
protagonists. But there is light in the darkness: 
the underground DJ, "Professor K," and his Jet Set 
Radio station keep tabs on what is happening on 
the streets of Tokyo-to, and soon our teens will 
have something much darker than the police to 
worry about. 
 
As one of the GG's, you skate through a variety of 
different levels, from busy streets to run-down 
rooftops and smelly sewers where you learn new 
moves, collect spray cans, and tag the streets 
with graffiti. New graffiti designs can be 
unlocked by finding "Graffiti Souls" in levels, by 
designing new graffiti yourself, or by going 
online and downloading any images you find while 
browsing the internet. Fight the rival gangs 
"Poison Jam" and the "Noise Tanks", the evil 
mega-corporation Rokkaku and their police cronies 
in this fresh take on the platform genre, mixing 
traditional platform elements with skating similar 
to that of the Tony Hawk's Pro Skater games. 
Players are scored on their performance in a 
level, both on the level of graffiti attempted as 
well as optional tags and skating tricks. As the 
game progresses challenge maps open that test the 
player's ability to do larger tags, more tricks, 
or race against an opponent. 
 
The American and European release contained two 
new levels based on New York. The story and order 
that you meet characters was modified to include 
these two levels. Both releases also have 
different unique soundtracks for these levels.

You start by choosing one of two characters, a 
professional photographer or pilot, and find your 
way through more than 12 levels of side-scrolling 
action, dodging dino's and other dangerous 
hazards. Along the paths are pieces of DNA. The 
task for each level is to collect enough DNA to 
open the exit at the end, opening the second part 
of the game, Dinosaur Creation. 
 
With the DNA you have collected, you must match 
them together correctly to create 10 different 
species of dinosaur. As you reach further into the 
game, the harder it becomes to correctly match the 
DNA samples.

attacked by a shadowy Meta Knight and split into 
four colored versions of himself!  The four 
Kirbies set off for Mirror World on an exciting 
new adventure! 
 
Kirby & The Amazing Mirror is set out in a 
Metroid-style manner.  The game features one 
sprawling overworld that players gradually uncover 
as they progress through the game.  It's also 
possible to discover hidden treasure chests that 
show the player the overworld layouts, life bar 
extensions, different colors for Kirby, and 
unlockable music and sound effects. 
 
Amazing Mirror uses the familiar 'suck-in and 
copy' mechanic of other Kirby games, but the 
addition of having four players able to co-operate 
simultaneously can make the game easier or more 
difficult - depending on the situation.  There are 
also three mini-games to play via the Game Boy

released in 2005, you are now able to play the 
movie.

wanting to make one of best movies.  He finds 
theater actress Ann Darrow and wants her to play 
the part of one of his characters.  Carl gets 
writer Jack Driscoll to finish Carl's script while 
they are traveling on a ship to an island that 
Carl believes to be real, but no one else does.  
He plans to shoot his movie there.  Once they 
arrive at the island known as Skull Island, Ann is 
captured and now Carl, Jack, & the cast of Carl's 
movie goes out to find her. 
 
This is a top-view game with cartoon-like visuals 
and some Legend Of Zelda type gameplay.  You start 
out with Jack, Carl, & Ann and at that point, you 
learn how to play the game in a short tutorial.  
Jack has a machete and a tommy gun so that makes 
him the attacker against the creatures that lurk 
on Skull Island.  Carl has grenades.  You could 
attack enemies with it, but your suppose to use 
them for getting rocks out of the way that block 
the entrance of caves.  Ann (in the beginning) can 
heal Jack & Carl.  After Ann is captured, you have 
to play as Jack & Carl. 
 
You can also play as King Kong a few times in the 
game.  They are short levels that consist of you 
playing as Kong in levels that are timed and that 
are like beat-em-up games we've seen in the past, 
and you slowly beat up the creatures that come 
after you.  You also get an energy boost when you 
defeat most of the enemies.

Recently, famine and drought have plagued Hyrule.  
When all seemed lost, a mysterious wizard, 
Agahnim, appeared, and stopped these strange 
happenings from occurring.  But there is talk that 
Agahnim now rules the country with his magic, 
behind the scenes.  And then, one night, the 
Princess of Hyrule, Zelda, calls out for 
help...and the one who hears her pleas is a young 
lad named Link... 
 
The Legend of Zelda: A Link to the Past is a 
top-down action adventure game (similar to the 
original Legend of Zelda) for the Super Nintendo 
and Game Boy Advance.  Players assume the role of 
Link, and their goal is to rescue Princess Zelda 
and save the land of Hyrule.  Unlike turn-based 
RPGs, all combat in Link to the Past is in 
real-time - you swing your sword at enemies by 
pressing a button, or can spin the sword around 
you for a more powerful attack by holding down the 
button until it is charged. 
 
Progression through the game is done by conquering 
a series of dungeons - each dungeon has its own 
special item associated with it, such as the 
hookshot (which latches onto a far-off object and 
pulls Link across) or the hammer (which can be 
used to flatten objects in your way).  Most of 
these dungeons are rendered impassable until the 
dungeon's particular item is acquired

Zelda no Densetsu - Fushigi no Boushi (c) Jan 10, 
2005 Flagship Co., Ltd. / Nintendo of America Inc. 
 
While at a festival with Princess Zelda, Link 
encounters a mysterious mage, called Vaati, who 
turns the princess to stone.  Helpless to stop 
them, Link is asked by the king to meet with a 
race of tiny people known as the Minish, who may 
be able to help with their predicament.  On his 
travels, Link teams up with a talking cap called 
Ezlo, who is able to shrink Link to the size of a 
Minish so that he can meet with them.  With his 
newfound abilities, Link must save the kingdom 
from Vaati's menace. 
 
The Legend of Zelda: The Minish Cap is a top-down 
action adventure game that tells the origins of 
the evil Vaati from Four Swords.  Players take on 
the role of Link as they conquer various dungeons 
to retrieve essential tools to fight enemies and 
progress through various obstacles.  Items such as 
the Mole Mitts allow Link to dig through dirt, 
while the Gust Jar can be used to suck in enemies, 
items, and propel Link.  Link can also shrink down 
to the size of a Minish with the aid of Ezlo, the 
talking cap. 
 
The Minish Cap uses the gameplay mechanic of 
shrinking to make familiar territory new and 
different.  Puddles become huge rivers, baby 
chicks are huge monsters, and regular enemies 
become deadly bosses at Minish size.  Link can 
also trade items called "Kinstones" with people in 
the game - when two pieces of the same Kinstone 
are joined together, new areas open up, treasure 
chests appear, and sometimes, even useful rewards 
are given to Link.

series), Lemony Snicket's a Series of Unfortunate 
Events for Game Boy Advance puts players in the 
unfortunate shoes of the incredibly unlucky 
Baudelaire orphans: Violet, Klaus, and Sunny. 
 
Each orphan has an unusual talent that will let 
them progress through three chapters (each with 
over a dozen levels). Though the game looks like a 
traditional side-scroller, combat takes a backseat 
to clever puzzle-solving and adventure game 
elements. The three orphans must use their 
talents, along with items found in the world, and 
various interactions to escape each level and 
avoid the evil Count Olaf and his elaborate plans 
to inherit the children's fortune. 
 
Inventions also take a big role in this game, and 
players will have to assemble them from common 
household objects. For example, in one level, 
Violet will be hunting for ice cream scoopers, 
soup cans, and a crank to invent an "apple 
chucker" which can help defeat Count Olaf's 
friends. 
 
The game offers quite a bit of replayability, too, 
with quest points and exotic books earned for 
discovering all the game's quirky secrets.

Nov 02, 2004 Griptonite Games / Electronic Arts,

The Lord of the Rings: The Third Age for the Game 
Boy Advance encompasses the entire Lord of the 
Rings trilogy, but does so in a unique turn-based 
strategy formula. 
 
Unlike the console versions, the Game Boy Advance 
version gives players the option of playing the 
heroes from the trilogy, selecting their commander 
from the likes of Aragorn and Gandalf, or even 
using the evil forces of Mordor and choosing the 
Witch-king or Saruman. 
 
From there, the player experiences over 30 battle 
scenarios, ranging from the well-known battles of 
the film (Helm's Deep and the Pelennor Fields), 
small skirmishes (Amon Hen and Osgiliath), and 
even some more battles just hinted at in the 
movies (Isildur's ambush, Theodred's death at the 
fords of the River Isen). 
 
In each battle, players choose their companions 
(again, classic characters from the films such as 
Legolas and Gimli are available, along with bad 
guys like Wormtongue and Gorbag), and face off 
against the foe with dozens of troops, including 
orcs, trolls, Gondorians, Riders of Rohan, 
Easterlings, Mumakil, and dozens more. 
 
Unlike other turn-based games, you can't move all 
of your units each turn. Rather, the board is 
divided into three "flanks," and your hero in each 
flank generates the command points you use to move 
units in that flank. Thus, good leaders like 
Aragorn may have a lot of command points to give 
his flank (3-4 is typical), while Gimli may have 
less, but be a better warrior to make up for it. 
 
After a battle, you can upgrade your heroes with 
equipment and special skills, and move onward to 
conquer the next area of Middle-earth.

Lord of the Rings, The - Futatsu no Tou (c) Nov 
12, 2002 Griptonite Games / Electronic Arts, Inc. 
 
This portable game is based on the movie version 
of the second installment of Tolkien's classic 
trilogy. While the console versions of The Two 
Towers were action games with 3D graphics, this 
version is a played from a top-down perspective, 
kind of like Gauntlet. 
 
The GBA version is an isometric action/RPG that 
allows players to take control of five characters: 
Aragorn, Legolas, Frodo, Eowyn and Gandalf the 
Wizard. Every character is challenged over 30 
levels, bringing the grand total to over 150 
levels in the entire game. Linked play will 
accommodate two-player multiplayer action via the 
GBA Link Cable.

Estopolis Densetsu (c) May 06, 2003 Neverland Co., 
Ltd. / Atlus U.S.A., Inc. 
 
The events of this game take place twenty-five 
years before those depicted in  Fortress of Doom. 
You control a young man named Eldin. His father 
was a great treasure hunter who once ventured into 
ancient ruins and never came back. Eldin became a 
hunter himself, and is looking for an adventure 
together with his friends Torma and Rami. Before 
soon the youngsters come into conflict with the 
evil kingdom of Gratze, and realize they have to 
do anything to stop their plans of resurrecting an 
ancient beast. 
 
This is a traditional Japanese RPG with turn-based 
combat viewed from top-down perspective. Enemy 
encounters are not random, and the enemies are 
visible on screen. You can gain advantage in 
battles if you initiate combat by approaching the 
enemy. The characters can master a variety of 
"jobs", learning abilities and switching classes, 
or combining them the way the player likes. You 
can also use special items in battle to capture 
monsters and to make them fight on you side. You 
can also upgrade those monsters and even merge 
with them to become more powerful.

This is the standard "Bowser has kidnapped the

and launched from a Super Mario 64-style cannon, 
which a pair of goombas aim directly at Bowser's 
Castle. Mario is also transformed into a ball and 
chases after her. 
 
There are 5 levels, each consisting of a set of 
pinball tables. Each table has some exits 
(including the one below the flippers) that Mario 
can use to move to other tables. Also, each one 
holds a star, normally obtained by defeating all 
enemies on the table. Some exits require that 
Mario has a certain number of stars. To gain 
access to Bowser's castle, Mario must defeat the 
bosses of the first 4 levels, which gives him star 
keys. The game also features a "Time Attack" mode, 
which allows players to fight already defeated 
bosses again.

Mario Tennis: Power Tour is the portable sibling 
of Mario Power Tennis on the GameCube. 
 
Aside from the standard spins, drop shots, lobs, 
and smashes available in a standard game of 
tennis, Power Tour adds power shots into the mix. 
Offensive power shots can be used to end a 
long-rally in your favor, while defensive power 
shots can help you make an impossible save. 
 
Following in the footsteps of other portable Mario 
Sports titles, Power Tour adds a bit of RPG-like 
features into the mix of standard tennis action. 
Story mode has you guide either one of the rookie 
players, Max or Tina, through the ranks of 
competitors in the academy on their way to the 
Island Open Championships. Winning matches against 
opponents in the academy rewards you with points 
you can use to raise your stats. Matches can 
either be in one-on-one Singles matches, or you 
can team up with an AI-controlled partner in 
Doubles. 
 
In between matches, you are also given the 
opportunity to explore the academy and participate 
in training courts and several mini-games, such as 
weight-lifting, to further build up your stats. 
Exhibition modes are also available for quick 
pick-up-and-play gameplay. Multiplayer modes 
include Singles and Doubles matches where you can 
choose from the stock cast of characters or you 
can also opt to use your powered up characters 
from the Story mode against each other.

In the third installment of Capcom's Mega Man Zero

Continuing where the Mega Man Zero 2 left off, you 
have to find and neutralize the recently escaped 
"Dark Elf," before it's able to brainwash the 
Resistance for the purpose of conquering Neo 
Arcadia. 
 
In addition to the old Cyber Elf system, this game 
also contains a new "chip" system, where Zero can 
gain new abilities by finding chips and installing 
chip in himself. But they didn't decide to abandon 
the Cyber Elves in this game by giving them 
nothing new. No, in order to extend the life of 
the Cyber Elves, they added the new concept of 
"Cyber Space" to levels, where you enter a door to 
Cyber Space and are allowed to use each Cyber Elf 
as much as you please without them dying. However, 
there aren't too many "Secret Disks" (items that 
can contain anything from profiles of characters 
to Cyber Elves to new chips) in Cyber Space, so 
it's better to spend more time in the normal 
level.

Build up special stables and enclosures for the 
different species. Feeding, playing, keeping 
company and even grooming are your daily tasks. 
Even if the work with the animals is a lot of fun, 
you will need a little time to yourself. Take your 
own horse for a ride across the fields.

Pirates have stolen an unknown life-form, recently 
discovered on the planet SR388. The life-form, 
called Metroid, is in a state of suspended 
animation and, according to analysis, was the 
cause of the complete destruction of SR388. If it 
ever got loose, the alien could destroy countless 
other systems. 
 
The pirates have taken the being to the planet 
Zebes and are fending off the Galactic 
Federation's attacks. It is up to the space bounty 
hunter Samus Aran to find her way into the 
planet's core, destroy the pirates, and take back 
the alien before the pirates complete their plans 
of world destruction. 
 
Zero Mission takes Samus back to her first battle 
with Mother Brain, expanding on the original story 
line and action from the original Nintendo 
classic, Metroid, with updated visuals, new 
puzzles to solve, and cut scenes filling in the 
personal story of Samus. 
 
The player can perform moves taken from the 
original game, along with additions taken from the 
last GBA mission, Metroid Fusion, including the 
power grab. This game can also be linked to 
Metroid Fusion to unlock special extras.

Metroid Fusion is the direct sequel to 1994's 
Super Metroid. The game begins as Samus Aran is 
sent back to planet SR388 to assist a Biologic 
Space Labs investigation team. While on the 
planet's surface, Samus is infected by a 
previously unknown parasite, known as X. The X 
parasite nearly kills Samus, but fortunately she 
is saved by a vaccine made from the Metroid she 
saved on Zebes. Shortly thereafter, an explosion 
rocks the Biologic Space Labs. Now Samus must 
investigate the Space Labs, which are orbiting 
SR388. 
 
This game is similar, in terms of gameplay and 
structure, to the classic side-scrolling Metroid 
games. The game consists of a large 
inter-connected environment. As Samus learns a 
variety of new moves and weapons, she is able to 
explore new areas of the Space Lab and unlock the 
secrets of the X parasite.

Monster Farm Advance (c) Nov 29, 2001 Tecmo, Ltd. 
/ Tecmo, Inc. 
 
Monster Rancher Advance is a monster raising sim 
that allows players to raise and customize 440 
monster types. These monsters can then be tested 
in in-game tournaments, or battled against other 
players in 2P mode with the GBA link cable. 
 
Monsters are created in the game's shrine through 
the entry of letters, numbers and punctuation 
symbols. Players begin with the ability to enter 
up to 4 characters to make monsters, and can 
unlock the ability to use up to 8 characters 
through gaining higher trainer ranks. Different 
words or combinations of characters can not only 
make different types of monsters, but each monster 
can have varying attributes and characteristics, 
making each one unique. 
 
Players then train the monsters by choosing  which 
foods to feed, which drills to do to raise 
attributes, what training to send them to for new 
attacks, and what items to give them. The game 
starts with a modest amount of money with which 
food and items can be purchased, more money is 
earned in tournaments. Gameplay revolves around 
planning training sessions, adding new attacks and 
juggling a bank account, along with attempting to 
win tournaments. As monsters age, they can be 
added to a coaching staff to help raise new 
monsters to better attributes, or they can be 
combined with other monsters to make stronger 
babies. Monsters do not die in this game, however, 
they do face an enforced retirement age. 
 
There is a fairly straightforward storyline, where 
some characters from older Monster Rancher games 
visit, and new characters are introduced. The 
gameplay itself, like most other Monster Rancher 
games, is open-ended and has unlimited replay 
value. 
 
The 2 Player mode, involving a link cable and two 
copies of the game, allows players to test the 
monsters they have raised against other players. 
The 2P mode also allows players to trade items and 
cash with one another, to wager items or cash on 
tournaments, and trade raised monsters into each 
others' games.

Monster Rancher Advance 2 is a monster raising sim 
where players can raise, battle, explore with any 
of 512 monsters. While it is the second Monster 
Rancher game on the Game Boy Advance system, it is 
not a true sequel, and does not require any 
knowledge of any other ranching games to play. 
 
Players make monsters by entering letters, 
numbers, and punctuation characters into the 
in-game shrine. At the start, players have access 
to up to 4 spaces to enter words or characters. As 
they improve their rank as a trainer, they can 
access more spaces, up to a maximum of 8. Players 
may also bring monsters into the game from their 
Monster Rancher Advance game, or trade monsters 
with other Monster Rancher Advance 2 players 
through use of a second GBA and a link cable. 
 
Players then raise their monster, deciding what 
foods to feed them, what drills to teach 
attributes at, what items to give them, what 
attacks to add in training, and which 
characteristics to add or remove at the Hospital. 
Monsters may become hurt or ill, and can be 
treated for a fee at the Hospital which also 
offers free checkups. Players start with a modest 
sum of money, and earn more by winning in-game 
tournaments, or by finding valuable items to sell 
on expeditions. 
 
The storyline is one of the longest and most 
complex of any Monster Rancher game. Unlocking 
various types of monsters involves participating 
in a variety of events including storyline quests 
on expeditions, and battling in various 
tournaments. Players will see characters from 
older Monster Rancher games, and be introduced to 
new characters. Monsters now develop bonds with 
each other and can become friends with monsters 
within the game, and with monsters in other 
player's games via link cable use. Completing the 
storyline requires over 200 hours of gameplay. 
 
Monsters do not die in this game, but they do face 
an enforced retirement age. When retired, they can 
coach other monsters to improve drills, and be 
used in combining to make stronger baby monsters 
with more attacks and better characteristics. 
 
This game has several improvements over the 
previous Game Boy Advance game including: a 
counter system added to battles, RPG style 
expeditions, a monster buddy system, a more 
complex coaching for pay system, super coaches, 
the ability to add or remove characteristics, 
diseases, tag team battles, more hidden monsters, 
and a new breed of monster. 
 
In 2 Player mode, monsters can battle against 
other player's monsters via the GBA link cable. 
Single monsters can face off against each other, 
or players can set up tag team battles.

Naruto - Ninjutsu Zenkai! Saikyou Ninja Daikesshuu 
(c) Mar, 2006 Tomy / Tomy 
 
Naruto: Ninja Council is another game that was 
taken from a famous Japanese anime series and is 
also the first installment of the Ninja Council 
series. 
 
It's a side scrolling, action oriented game with 
two modes to choose - Story mode and Free mode - 
and two playable characters. The story of Ninja 
Council starts from the survival exam and ends 
with Orochimaru’s attack at the Hidden Konoha 
Village. Apart from that there are no actual 
events between that - that take place on the anime 
although there are fights with certain characters 
that do like the fight with Haku and Orochimaru. 
 
The characters that are available are Naruto and 
Sasuke. When you start a new game at the beginning 
of each stage Kakashi sensei appears to give you 
hints about the controls and other useful staff 
like a boss’ weak point or attack patterns. There 
are also hidden characters you can find who can 
restore your health when you run out of life. 
Stages have a time limit of 5 minutes to complete. 
At the end of each stage there is a boss fight and 
the timer resets at 5 minutes in which you have to 
win the battle in order to advance the game and be 
able to save your progress. 
 
The two available characters - Naruto and Sasuke - 
can both use the same combo hits and weapons that 
can be picked up in each stage like shuriken and 
kunai. Every second stage the player will also 
find scrolls that contain elemental power ups like 
the Lightning Style Scroll that can be used either 
for attacking opponents or for progressing in the 
game. Apart from that each one has a set of three 
unique special attacks that can be used but only 
if you have sufficient amount of chakra.

Naruto - Ninjutsu Zenkai! Saikyou Ninja Daikesshuu 
2 (c) Oct 10, 2006 Aspect Co. Ltd. / D3Publisher

This is the second Naruto title for the Ninja 
Council series and follows the adventures of 
Naruto, Sasuke and Sakura as they try to pass the 
Chunin Exam in a total of seven stages. 
 
Unlike the first title you can now control three 
characters by changing them anytime you want 
inside the game. Each one has unique sequences of 
punches and kicks and can use 3 special techniques 
with varying results from one character to 
another. The shuriken, kunai and fuma from the 
first game are still here although this time one 
hit is enough to dispatch an enemy. Along the 
stages you can also find summoning scrolls and use 
them in fights to call Kakashi, Choji and others 
to attack the enemies. Another addition to the 
gameplay is the Teleport move which as the name 
implies allows you to teleport near or behind an 
enemy to attack him or simply dodge his attacks. 
At parts of each stage you may be given certain 
objectives such as to defeat all the enemies or 
finish the stage within a time limit and 
parameters like the use of only one character. At 
the end of each stage you get a grade depending on 
how many enemies you killed, how fast you finished 
the stage, how many characters you are left and 
how many leaves you have collected. At the end of 
the game these grades will be accumulated to 
decide your final rank. 
 
The game also features two additional modes – the 
Co-op Mode and the Vs. Mode but you need the link 
cable for that.

Pokemon - Emerald (c) May 01, 2005 Creatures, 
Inc.|Game Freak, Inc. / Nintendo of America Inc. 
 
Pokémon Emerald is the fifth Pokémon game of the 
advanced generation, after its predecessors Ruby, 
Sapphire, FireRed, and LeafGreen. It takes place 
in the world of Hoenn but can also connect with 
Kanto-based games FireRed and LeafGreen as well. 
Like Pikachu and Suicune were for Yellow and 
Crystal respectively, Rayquaza plays a vital role 
in this game along with the other Legendaries, 
Groudon and Kyogre. Though similar to the original 
storyline that occurs in Hoenn, Emerald offers 
more changes than Yellow and Crystal. 
 
In terms of gameplay, there have been several 
alterations to the game: 
 
Legendaries 
 
1. Ability to catch Rayquaza before the Elite 
   Four, as well as both Groudon and Kyogre after 
   it. 
2. Changes to catching the Regis. 
3. Ability to catch either one of Latios or 
   Latias. 
 
Graphics 
 
1. New outfits for the characters. 
4. New Pokémon animations. 
 
Features 
 
1. Ability to enter the Safari Zone Extension, 
   where you can catch Johto (the world of Pokémon 
   Gold, Silver and Crystal) Pokémon like Houndour 
   and Miltank. 
5. The Battle Frontier, an island full of 
   different battle stadiums. 
6. Ability to get both of the Claw and Root 
   fossils. 
 
These are of the changes you might notice at first 
while playing Pokémon Emerald. However, there are

Pokemon - Edicion Esmeralda (c) May 01, 2005 
Creatures, Inc.|Game Freak, Inc. / Nintendo of 
America Inc. 
 
Pokémon Emerald is the fifth Pokémon game of the 
advanced generation, after its predecessors Ruby, 
Sapphire, FireRed, and LeafGreen. It takes place 
in the world of Hoenn but can also connect with 
Kanto-based games FireRed and LeafGreen as well. 
Like Pikachu and Suicune were for Yellow and 
Crystal respectively, Rayquaza plays a vital role 
in this game along with the other Legendaries, 
Groudon and Kyogre. Though similar to the original 
storyline that occurs in Hoenn, Emerald offers 
more changes than Yellow and Crystal. 
 
In terms of gameplay, there have been several 
alterations to the game: 
 
Legendaries 
 
1. Ability to catch Rayquaza before the Elite 
   Four, as well as both Groudon and Kyogre after 
   it. 
2. Changes to catching the Regis. 
3. Ability to catch either one of Latios or 
   Latias. 
 
Graphics 
 
1. New outfits for the characters. 
4. New Pokémon animations. 
 
Features 
 
1. Ability to enter the Safari Zone Extension, 
   where you can catch Johto (the world of Pokémon 
   Gold, Silver and Crystal) Pokémon like Houndour 
   and Miltank. 
5. The Battle Frontier, an island full of 
   different battle stadiums. 
6. Ability to get both of the Claw and Root 
   fossils. 
 
These are of the changes you might notice at first 
while playing Pokémon Emerald. However, there are 
lots of other improvements apart from the new 
storyline that separates this game from its 
predecessors.

(c) Sep 09, 2004 Creatures, Inc.|Game Freak, Inc.

Pokémon FireRed takes the player into the world of 
Kanto on a mission to catch all of the 350 pokémon 
for Pokémon researcher Prof. Oak. Pokémon are 
animal-looking creatures that pretty much form 
this and all the other games in the Pokémon 
Universe. The challenge is to capture them all 
using pokéballs and an own set of these strange 
creatures, as well as training them for the 
ultimate battle, the Elite Four! 
 
The game is a remake of the original Pokémon Red 
and offers the same diversity of gameplay as the 
original. However, this game has got everything 
the player might miss in the classic game: updated 
art and graphics, new pokémon, and perhaps the 
most interesting: the wireless adapter. This 
allows the player to trade wireless with friends 
within a limited radius. In addition to all of 
this, the player may explore a new set of islands 
outside of Kanto, the Sevii Islands! Enter the 
union room, make a dream team or explore the world 
of Kanto in this epic gameplay experience from the 
Universe of Pokémon.

creatures, as well as training them for the 
ultimate battle, the Elite Four! 
 
The game is a remake of the original Pokémon Red 
and offers the same diversity of gameplay as the 
original. However, this game has got everything 
the player might miss in the classic game: updated 
art and graphics, new pokémon, and perhaps the 
most interesting: the wireless adapter. This 
allows the player to trade wireless with friends 
within a limited radius. In addition to all of 
this, the player may explore a new set of islands 
outside of Kanto, the Sevii Islands! Enter the 
union room, make a dream team or explore the world 
of Kanto in this epic gameplay experience from the 
Universe of Pokémon. 
 
Gotta catch 'em all!

Breaking the conventions of prior Pokémon games, 
you play as a human who has suddenly been 
transformed into a Pokémon, but before you could 
come to grips with this startling revelation, a 
Butterfree needs help! It's baby Caterpie has 
fallen into a dungeon and cannot get out! 
 
You and other Pokémon you befriend along the way 
must brave randomly created dungeons to help out 
other Pokémon who find themselves in need of 
rescuing or  just need something delivered. Both 
happen. 
 
Unlike previous Pokémon games, the battles take 
place on the map (though they are still turn 
based), and although you may only directly control 
the Pokémon that represents you in the game, you 
can your companions vague battle orders. Such as: 
use more special attacks or conserve items.

Pokémon is back for another round catching and 
training! You're the new guy (or girl) in 
Littleroot Town, and the newest generation of 
Pokémon trainers. Professor Birch sends you on 
your way in your journey, with one of your choice 
of 3 starter Pokémon. There's Treecko (A 
grass-type chameleon-like little guy) Torchic (a 
Fire-type bird) and Mudkip (a Water-type 
amphibious creature). 
 
Now, you've got a whole new world to explore in 
Hoenn, with eight new gyms and two-on-two battles, 
opening up a whole new myriad of tactics! New 
items, new Pokémon (over 350!!), and a new Pokédex 
to boot too! And of course we have our new 
villains, the nefarious Team Aqua, who plan on 
submerging the world in water in order to call out 
the Legendary Kyogre! 
 
Only one person can stop them and become the 
ultimate Pokémon Master... You!

Tsuukin Hitofude (c) Nov, 2006 Mitchell 
Corporation / Atlus U.S.A., Inc. 
 
Polarium Advance is basically the same as Polarium 
for the Nintendo DS, but a couple of new blocks 
have been added. 
 
This is a puzzle game in which the player must 
create horizontal lines of all the same color 
(either black or white). To change the color (or 
"polarity") of a block, you must select the blocks 
in one line. In most puzzles, you can use the 
border to lengthen the line. The new blocks in the 
Advance version are: Hurdle Tiles, which you 
cannot pass, Multi-Tiles, which count as black or 
white, and Solid Tiles, which will not turn but 
are removed so that the tiles above them fall 
down. There are 365 puzzles in this mode (Daily 
Polarium) ranging from very easy to quite 
challenging. 
 
The Time Attack Mode requires you to solve either 
ten easy puzzles or five hard puzzles within the 
time given. Leaving a block of the wrong color in 
a line results in a 30 seconds penalty. 
 
It is possible to create your own puzzles and 
share them with friends. Puzzles created in the 
Nintendo DS version of the game are compatible 
with the GBA version.

radar provides the coordinates on her booferberry 
of the robots turning the citizens into zombies. 
Next to the main missions, there are also bonus 
levels marked by a red spot. To complete a

back into citizens, but the green ones cannot be 
saved anymore.

pictures. A third option, codes, allows the player 
to enter codes found on a website to change a few

Accord, teacher of the local magic school, has 
lost her magic flying cane. There is word of an 
award so the students are busy searching high and 
low for it. Naturally our heros, Amitie and her 
school nemesis Raffine, make their way toward the 
distant dark castle. Challenging, and being 
challenged by, everyone you come across in a game 
of, Puyo Pop! 
 
A puzzle game of the falling-block variety the 
goal of which is to clear your blocks (Puyos) by 
is the combining four or more of the same color 
which will vanish. This will produce Nuisance 
Puyos. These colorless Puyos will fall onto you 
opponents screen, thus blocking chains and combos 
they could create. These pesky Puyos can only be 
exterminated by removing neighboring Puyos. 
 
When an opponent send Nuisance Puyos to you screen 
you can try to "offset" by clearing your own Puyos 
and limiting the number that would fall on your 
screen. This will also increase your Fever Meter. 
When this meter fills you will be given a set of 
prearranged Puyos with which you can wrack up 
giant combos and send tons of Nuisance Puyos to 
you opponent. When any players field becomes so 
full they can no longer drop Puyos they lose the 
game. 
 
Puyo Pop Fever features a Two Player Mode. Some 
versions allow for more people such as the DS 
version which allows up to eight players to 
compete in free-for-all or team modes.

Riviera: The Promised Land is a turn based role 
playing game. It follows a traditional RPG formula 
- once peaceful land now ravaged by demons and 
their wars with angels. However, it also 
incorporates a "dating sim" as a subplot where 
your character must win affection of another 
character. 
 
It has similarities to Fire Emblem, Final Fantasy 
Tactics, Golden Sun and a number of others. 
Reaching high levels is important to make the game 
not too difficult at the end. The levelling up is 
similar to Secret of Mana, where the weapon skill 
for a character increases at a different rate to 
the character levels.

Scurge Hive (c) Oct 24, 2006 Orbital Media, Inc. / 
SouthPeak Interactive, LLC 
 
When bounty hunter Jenosa Arma takes on a mission 
to investigate Planet Inos, a research center 
investigating an alien lifeform called Scurge, she 
gets more than she bargained for.  While in orbit 
around the planet, she is attacked and quickly 
infected with the Scurge herself.  Jenosa has no 
alternative but to land onto Inos, to investigate 
the Scurge and find a cure. 
 
Scurge: Hive is an action game with some 
similarities in storyline to Nintendo's Metroid 
series.  However, the game itself is significantly 
different from Metroid. As Jenosa, players must 
blast their way through Planet Inos while trying 
to constantly contain their own infection.  While 
progressing through the game, Jenosa's 'infection 
meter' slowly increases (faster if she is standing 
on red patches of Scurge) - the meter can only be 
reduced back to 1% by using a Decontamination 
Platform, which also acts as a save point.  
Failing to temporarily cure Jenosa of the Scurge 
results in rapid depletion of life as the virus 
takes over, so players must complete mission 
objectives quickly! 
 
Jenosa can earn experience as she blasts infected 
life forms

Shining Force: Resurrection of the Dark Dragon is 
a remake of the first Shining Force game. The 
story still revolves around the Runefaust army 
trying to resurrect the Dark Dragon, but it 
features some new additions like new characters 
and additional story sequences in-between battles. 
Furthermore, dialogues have been expanded and the 
main hero has a background story now and is able 
to talk. Graphics have also received a complete 
overhaul, and the sound quality has been improved, 
although the compositions are the same as in the 
original. 
 
The heart of the game are of course the tactical 
turn-based battles. You can take up to twelve 
different members of your Shining Force into 
battle. There are many different classes ranging 
from fighters and magicians to healers, knights, 
monks, ninjas and many more. In-between battles 
you can explore various towns to buy new weapons 
and items or chat with the townsfolk. There are 
also a number of secret characters and items to be 
discovered. 
 
Shining Force's gameplay has also seen some 
changes. The interface has been slightly 
simplified and you can now organize your units 
before battles. During battles, it is now possible 
to view upcoming turns, which makes it much easier 
to plan your next steps. To make the battles more 
interesting, even for fans of the original, you 
receive certain bonuses (usually money or a 
weapon) for completing battles in a set number of 
turns. Finally, a card-collecting side-quest has 
been added. Cards can have various effects in 
battle and one character is able to transform into 
the cards that you have found.

Space Invaders EX (c) Mar 19, 2002 Torus Games 
Pty. Ltd. / Activision Publishing, Inc. 
 
In 1978, Earth successfully repulsed an invasion 
from outer space thanks to "the Tank."  The Tank 
was based on alien technology found when a scout 
ship had crashed years earlier.  Now, over 20 
years later, a new Tank has been created based on 
the technology recovered during the 1978 invasion. 
 And none too soon, because the Invaders are back! 
 
Space Invaders is yet another classic arcade game 
remake by Activision.  (See Battlezone and 
Asteroids.)  But this time, Activision licensed a 
game from Taito instead of Atari.  The game stays 
close to its roots while adding many power-ups and 
enemies. 
 
You can play either one or two players against the 
Invaders, who march down the screen in orderly 
rows and columns, at one of three skill levels.  
You'll start at Pluto and work your way through 
the Solar System to Mars, then Venus, and finally 
Earth.  There are four common aliens (red, green, 
blue, and yellow), plus seven more less common 
ones.  You receive special one shot power-ups by 
shooting four of the same type of Invaders in a 
row.  As in the original game, there are also 
Mother Ships that fly above the action, but in 
this version if you hit them you can pick up other 
useful power-ups like shields or double shots.  
Plus, after fighting off several waves on each 
planet, you'll face a unique boss.  If you manage 
to finish the game, you'll be able to play a 
reproduction of the original coin-op.

Spider-Man - Der Film (c) Apr 16, 2002 Digital 
Eclipse Software, Inc. / Activision Publishing, 
Inc. 
 
Spider-Man, the classic comic book co-created by 
Stan Lee, is now a major motion picture. This 
conversion of the movie to the video game world 
takes the major storyline, characters and artwork 
of the Spider-Man movie and adds a lengthy 
backstory and new characters. 
 
The Green Goblin is the main villian here, and as 
Peter Parker you must defy gravity using your 
spider crawl, web-slinging and spider-sense 
abilities to track down Spidey's nemesis through 
the skyscapers of New York City. 
 
The major inclusion for this title over the 
previous Spider-Man series (on Playstation also by 
Activision) is aerial combat. Attack the enemy 
mid-air while web-slinging, rise and decend while 
swinging and banking around buildings create a 
greater emphasis on Spidey's greatest asset, the 
spider web.

In Spirits and Spells the player takes the role of 
the two kids Alicia and Greg which visit a spooky 
old house with their friends. Unfortunately the 
Bogeyman steals the soles of their friends and 
turns them into stone - of course the two heroes 
have to get them back. So they visit the Land of 
Dead and have to survive a cemetery, a haunted 
house and the lab of a mad scientist (overall 15 
stages). 
 
The player can switch instantly (but limited 
because it costs crystals which can be found in 
the levels) between the two characters which is 
often needed to progress in the game: both have 
distinct advantages and disadvantages. Alicia is 
disguised as a witch, is strong with the ice 
element, can attack from a range and doesn't take 
damage from long falls.  Greg on the other hand is 
the master of fire, is disguised as imp and has a 
super jump. Both have also a special attack which 
also cost crystals to perform. The gameplay is the 
usual platforming along with fighting enemies. 
 
The main difference to the console version is that 
the whole game is in 2D with different level 
design and less puzzle elements.

One of the Professor's inventions has

space/time, creating a portal between the Rhynoc 
Lands and the Dragon Realms. Ripto, naturally, is 
taking full advantage of this, as he starts 
sending his armies of rhynocs through the portal 
to wreak havoc. Spyro must find somehow find a way 
to close the portal before Ripto succeeds in 
taking over the Dragon Realms. 
 
This is Spyro's third outing on the Game Boy 
Advance. Features include new RPG-like elements, 
new upgradable breath abilities, and three 
playable characters (Spyro, Agent 9 the Space 
Monkey, and Sgt. Byrd). Bonus multiplayer Sgt.Byrd 
levels can also be unlocked.

Spyro the dragon returns for his first adventure 
on the Game Boy Advance. This time, Grendor has 
turned all of the fairies of the Dragon Realms 
into ice blocks, sending out his band of Rhynoc 
warriors to collect them, and use them to stop his 
headache. Only the fire power of Spyro, with 
Hunter and Sparx on hand to help, can save the 
fairies from a certain Panadol future. 
 
Unlike the Playstation series, Seasons of Ice has 
the player controlling Spyro through an isometric 
overhead camera. However, all of Spyro's skills 
are still available to use, including his flame 
breath and glide. And the flying bonus levels 
(similar to that of the original Sonic series of 
bonus levels) make use of the Mode 7 technology in 
order to create the 3D like perspective (as used 
in Mario Kart: Super Circuit and F-Zero: Maximum 
Velocity).

Kootetsu Teikoku from Hot-B (c) Apr 30, 2004 Hot-B 
Co., Ltd. / Starfish Inc. 
 
The skies are populated by zeppelins, large 
battleships and flying fortresses. In this age of 
steel, the Motorhead Empire has conquered and 
enslaved almost the entire planet. The last free 
nation, the Republic of Silverhead, tries to bring 
the Motorhead Empire down using its newly 
developed weapon, the lightning bomb. 
 
Apart from its unusual Steampunk setting, Steel 
Empire is a fairly traditional side-scrolling 
shooter. At the beginning of every level, the 
player gets to choose between a striker plane and 
a zeppelin. While the plane is faster, the 
zeppelin has a longer life bar and can therefore 
sustain more damage. Both ships use the same 
standard weapon, which can be fired forwards or 
backwards, as well as bombs that are released 
automatically while firing. Also available is a 
limited number of lightning bombs that damage or 
destroy all enemies on screen. 
 
Defeated enemies often drop power-ups, including 
hearts that replenish health, lightning bombs, 
bonus points, 1-UPs, options and experience 
points. 
 
Options are small "drones" that fly alongside the 
player's ship and mimic its behaviour. 
 
Experience points can be collected to level up the 
ships' weapons (up to level 20) and thereby 
increase their fire power.

Street Fighter Zero 3 Upper (c) Dec 06, 2002 
Crawfish Interactive Ltd. / Capcom Entertainment, 
Inc. 
 
Street Fighter Alpha 3, the third game in the 
Alpha series, has a total of 31 fighters, the most 
in the series so far. New characters include old 
favorites E. Honda, Blanka, Vega, Cammy, T. Hawk, 
Dee Jay, Juni and Juli. Some of the newest 
fighters on the block include a former Final Fight 
character (Cody, who has been in jail since the 
last Final Fight game, or so his clothing 
suggests), Karin Kanzuki and Rainbow Mika. 
 
The major difference between this Alpha and the 
last two are the new play modes World Tour, 
Arcade, VS, Training and Entry. 
 
World Tour - Simply choose your fighter and travel 
around the world, fighting the home town heroes 
that you run into. The more fights you win, the 
stronger you fighter becomes. You can also learn 
new moves, and there are three levels of Super 
moves to choose from before you start each round 
(called Isms). 
 
Arcade - A simple conversion of the arcade 
version. Beat each fighter with your chosen 
warrior, in three rounds per match (much the same 
as past versions of Street Fighter) 
 
Versus - Two human players battle it out. 
 
Training - A good way to learn all the super moves 
that are available, against a dummy. 
 
Entry - If you save your character during the 
World Tour mode, you can upload him here to use in 
the other modes in the game (especially handy for 
Training). 
 
Finally, if you complete certain areas of the game 
three new fighters become available, including 
another old favourite in Guile, Evil Ryu and Shin 
Akuma.

Summon Night - Craft Sword Monogatari 2 (c) Oct 
17, 2006 Flight-Plan / Atlus U.S.A., Inc. 
 
You are a male or female apprentice Craftknight 
and the Edge Fencer.  It is your job to protect 
the seal trapping Goura, a stray summon creature 
who is too powerful for anyone to control.  
Similar to Summon Night: Swordcraft Story, your 
father died 3 years ago.  He died trying to trap 
Goura after a summoner tried to free Goura and 
take control of him.  Now it is your job to 
protect that seal, while you are working at 
becoming a Craftknight. 
 
A Craftknight is a person who creates weapons and 
uses them, similar to an armorer.  However, these 
weapons are made with the combined power of your 
hammer and your Guardian Beast.  You will have the 
ability to choose between 4 Guardian Beasts 
shortly after starting the game.  Each one has 
different abilities and will have different 
conversations throughout the game.  Unlike in the 
previous game, you do not learn techniques for 
making weapons, but instead you use shapestones to 
create a weapon type.  There are 6 weapon types 
that can be made and you will need at least a 
basic weapon from each type in order to reach all 
areas of the game.  The actual weapon you create 
will be determined by the material you use to 
create it.  If you make it with Iron Ore, it will 
be one kind of weapon, while if you make it with 
Aqua Ore, it will be another kind of weapon.  
Later, you will have the ability to upgrade the 
weapons up to three times each. 
 
Battles are the same as in the previous game. You 
fight in a side scrolling area with up to 4 
enemies.  You can use your weapon to attack, or 
use your Guardian Beast's magic to attack, heal or 
protect you, or enchant your weapon in some way.  
Some weapons will also have special attacks that 
can do even more damage.  In this game, you'll 
have battles above and below ground, rather than 
just in the dungeon and arena.  You also have the 
ability to Mono Shift, where you will change into 
a more powerful being.  You can only do this once 
before recharging the item that allows you to Mono 
Shift.

Super Puzzle Bobble Advance (c) Nov 28, 2001 Taito 
Corporation / Ubi Soft Entertainment Software 
 
Super Bust-A-Move brings with it all of the 
entertaining puzzle action of the series with the 
addition of new multiplayer modes and graphical 
improvements. 
 
The aim of the game, as with the previous titles 
in the series, is to remove a collected number of 
coloured bubbles from the game screen. To do so, 
at the bottom of the screen, you aim and fire the 
coloured bubbles from a launcher, sending the 
bubbles upwards into the container. Match three or 
more together of the same colour to clear them 
from the screen. If you're too slow, the 
collection of bubbles moves down the screen 
towards you, and the game will end if it reaches 
the bottom. 
 
Classic mode features a number of bubble puzzles 
previously seen in the Bust-A-Move series, while 
Normal mode has some new variations on the bubble 
removing theme. Two players can also compete 
against each other.

Mario and his brother Luigi are back for this

along with Princess Peach, are vacationing in 
Dinosaur Island. Then when they least expect it, 
Bowser once again kidnaps Peach and takes her to 
his castle. On the way to rescue her, the plumbers 
find Yoshi, who tells them that Bowser has also 
turned his friends into eggs. So the Mario 
brothers, with the help of Yoshi, must rescue the 
princess and Yoshi's pals. 
 
Mario and Luigi can run and jump through each 
level. They can also collect power-ups to gain new 
skills. The Super Mushroom makes them grow and 
gain more defense. The Fire Flower lets the 
brothers throw fireballs to defeat enemies. The 
Starman makes them invincible. The plumbers can 
gain the ability of flight with the Cape Feather. 
 
Yoshi can help Mario and Luigi if they find an 
egg. The green dinosaur can use his tongue to eat 
enemies or grab power-ups. He can walk across 
certain enemies with his shoes. Yoshi can eat 
differently colored 
Koopa shells to briefly gain more abilities. For 
instance, the blue shell gives him wings, red 
shells let him spit fireballs, and the yellow 
shell allows him to stomp the ground. 
 
This update over the original Super Nintendo 
version includes character speech (as heard in 
Mario Advance and Mario Kart Super Circuit). Up to 
four players can compete in the classic Mario 
Bros. game, included with the main game.

level. They can also collect power-ups to gain new 
skills. The Super Mushroom makes them grow and 
gain more defense. The Fire Flower lets the 
brothers throw fireballs to defeat enemies. The 
Starman makes them invincible. The plumbers can 
gain the ability of flight with the Cape Feather. 
 
Yoshi can help Mario and Luigi if they find an 
egg. The green dinosaur can use his tongue to eat 
enemies or grab power-ups. He can walk across 
certain enemies with his shoes. Yoshi can eat 
differently colored 
Koopa shells to briefly gain more abilities. For 
instance, the blue shell gives him wings, red 
shells let him spit fireballs, and the yellow 
shell allows him to stomp the ground. 
 
This update over the original Super Nintendo 
version includes character speech (as heard in 
Mario Advance and Mario Kart Super Circuit). Up to 
four players can compete in the classic Mario 
Bros. game, included with the main game.

Top Gear GT Championship carries the official 
Japanese GT title and lets players race fast cars 
on different GT tracks. The game features two main 
game modes: quick race and championship. In quick 
race, players can alone, against another human 
player or create custom courses for the game. This

computer and time attack. The game can also 
connect through mobile phones to check global 
rankings, enter local ranking entries, and 
download ghosts and new courses. 
 
In the championship mode, players need to complete 
the courses in a fixed order while a ranking is 
kept. The cars are shown from a third-person 
perspective and there are different AI-controlled 
racers to beat. Prior to the races, players can do 
free runs, qualify and eventually start the race 
or tune the car further. There are two weather 
types, sunny and rainy, which affects the handling 
of the cars. 
 
There are different cars and courses to choose 
from, with extensive tuning options based on the 
gear ratio, steering, brakes, tires, aerodynamic 
settings and the height handicap. There are also 
three difficulty levels.

enough, instead of pooling their resources, Bugs, 
Daffy, Sylvester, and the rest of the Looney Tunes

collect the gems. On a massive game board, the 
player and up to three opponents (CPU or human)

Wario's thrown a temper tantrum while playing his 
Game Boy Advance, and gone and broken it!  He 
heads off to the manic Dr. Crygor's lab to get him 
to fix it.  But what happens instead is that 
hundreds of Game Boy-like systems are created, 
with no buttons and an addictive tilt control!  
Wario's gonna be even richer than ever before when 
he sells this! 
 
WarioWare Twisted! is the sequel to the sleeper 
hit WarioWare Inc.: Mega: Microgame$!.  It 
includes a built-in rumble pack and gyro sensor 
which the games have been designed around.  Over 
two hundred five second games are hurled at the 
player as they make their way through the stage, 
trying to figure out what to do with a short 
description like "Play!", "Avoid!" or "Digest!".  
Each stage has a random game thrown at you, with a 
short time to complete it.  Fail it, and you lose 
one of your four lives.  Lose all four and it's 
game over.  Pass enough games, and you'll get told 
"FASTER!" and the games start coming at you at a 
quicker speed.  Finally, you'll encounter a Boss 
Stage, which has no time limit and is tougher to 
beat. 
 
Each character's stage is based around a different 
'theme'.  Mona's games require you to make only a 
small spin to pass them, Jimmy T.'s games need a 
consistent rhythm to play, Kat and Ana's games 
simply need the use of the A Button, Dr. Crygor's 
games involve changing gravity itself, while the 
Nintendo nerd pair 9-Volt and 18-Volt have a set 
of Nintendo games which use all of the different 
styles of play from the other game sets. 
 
Twisted! also has a huge amount of novelty 
unlockables to collect.  Once you've played 
through Story Mode, you can replay the games again 
for a higher score and bonus toys.  Whenever you 
beat a Boss Game after completing Story Mode once, 
you'll be prompted to spin to get a bonus prize.  
This prize could be as simple as a light wand that 
you shake to see a picture, or a small 
arcade-style game involving sewing or rolling a 
cat around the floor while shooting bugs.

help you gain the cards needed for a deck powerful 
enough to defeat Reshef.  Build up your duelist 
level so you can have more powerful cards in your 
deck.  Buy, sell, and wager cards in order to 
improve your deck.  With over 800 cards and the 
three Egyptian God cards, you can personalize your 
deck however you choose. 
 
Use the Link cable to duel friends, trade cards, 
and improve your skill level, or just duel the 
opponents in the game itself.  The choice is 
yours. 
 
The game is played through with a storyline rather 
than just dueling.  This helps to move things 
along and keep the player interested.  You must 
defeat Reshef.  Can you do it?

Yu-Gi-Oh! - Duel Monsters 7 Kettou Toshi 
   Densetsu (c) Nov 04, 2003 Konami Corporation / 
   Konami Corporation 
 
Yu-Gi-Oh and friends are here for a tournament 
   hosted by Kaiba Corporation.  You must obtain 6 
   locater cards in order to get into the 
   tournament.  To obtain these cards, you must 
   battle various people around the city.  As you 
   battle the duelists, you have the opportunity 
   to gain new cards (if you win), or lose cards 
   (if you lose).  There is also a card shop if 
   you want to buy cards rather than using only 
   what you get from antes. 
 
The battles are played just like the in trading 
card game.  You use your cards' effects and 
strengths to defeat the other players' cards.  By 
lowering their life points to 0, you will defeat 
them. 
 
A feature in this game is your duelist level.  
Cards have certain levels on them.  If your 
duelist level is below that number, you cannot 
have that card in your deck.  This is a new 
feature not seen in previous games.  This feature 
keeps you from just buying all the best cards at 
the start and having an easy time for the rest of 
the game.  By winning duels, you will gain in 
level quickly enough to start using some of the 
better cards, though it will still take some time 
to be able to use the best cards. 
 
Can you get into the tournament and win the 3 
Egyptian God cards?  Yu-Gi-Oh and his friends are 
also trying to get into the tournament.  So you'll 
have to beat them in the tournament to win 
everything. 
 
With over 900 cards and over 100 duelists, you 
will have plenty to do in this game.

Yu-Gi-Oh! - Duel Monsters Expert 3 (c) Feb 11, 
   2004 Konami Computer Entertainment Japan, Inc. 
   / Konami Digital Entertainment, Inc. 
 
Yu-Gi-Oh! returns in the form of a Tournament 
   edition which will be used in an official 
   Worldwide Tournament in 2004 in Los Angeles.  
   The game also has a text translation utility 
   that will allow gamers who link with one 
   another to translate text automatically between 
   languages.  The languages included are 
   Japanese, French, Spanish, German, Italian, and 
   English.  These are also the languages you can 
   view the game in. 
 
The game continues the tradition of the Yu-Gi-Oh! 
card battles.  There is little to the game other 
than battling your opponents.  This game is a 
sequel to Yu-Gi-Oh! Worldwide Edition: Stairway to 
the Destined Duel and offers more than 1000 cards 
to use as well as new opponents.  The game takes 
out some of the non-card battling features from 
the Worldwide Edition and leaves you with the 
battling as the main feature of the game. 
 
Build up to three decks with the cards you gain as 
you work to beat all your opponents.  With over 
1000 cards, you will have a wide range of choices 
for your 40-card decks. 
 
As with the Worldwide Edition, you can also trade 
your cards with friends through the Link Cable.

Yu-Gi-Oh! - Duel Monsters International (c) 
   Apr, 2003 Konami Computer Entertainment Japan, 
   Inc. / Konami of America, Inc. 
 
The Worldwide Edition of Yu-Gi-Oh! is another 
chance to play Yu-Gi-Oh! on the Gameboy Advance.  
The main point of the game is to allow you to 
battle others with your Yu-Gi-Oh! deck.  You 
choose to move to the next area or stay in your 
current area of the map and battle whoever is 
there. 
 
When you are in the map mode, you have the option 
of staying where you are and battling anyone in 
your area who will battle, or moving to an area 
adjacent to your own.  To help you decide what to 
do, the map will show you the people in your space 
and the spaces around your space.  Depending on 
what is shown to you, you can easily tell if each 
person wants to talk to you or battle you.  If you 
have not battled a person yet, you will not be 
able to see who they are until you choose to 
battle them (except with a small number of people 
you already know to start the game). 
 
Each week you can get 5 more cards through a 
magazine that you are given.  If you choose to, 
you can add these to your deck right away.  
Otherwise, you can leave them in your trunk to be 
added later. 
 
Each weekend, you can participate in a tournament 
if you're in the right location that weekend to do 
so.  Winning the tournaments can gain you some new 
cards by opening up new (locked) booster packs of 
cards that you can choose from when you win 
battles. 
 
As you get more cards, Duelist Points, or just win 
many times against a single opponent, you will 
also open up more booster packs to choose from 
when winning duels. 
 
The game also allows for dueling friends using a 
link cable, or even trading cards with friends.

Zoids Saga II (c) Sep 15, 2004 Amedio Co., Ltd. / 
Atari, Inc. 
 
On the planet Zi, far away in the universe, there 
are both good and evil inhabitants. To gain 
control of the planet, they use mechanized robots 
called Zoids to battle for control of the world. 
During an experiment, Zoids warriors from 
different eras, the Chaotic Century and the New 
Century, collide. Players take control of Zoids 
warrior Zeru, who wants to restore the chaos with 
the help of his friends Van, Fiona and Bit Cloud. 
There are different types of Zoids to choose from, 
and each one of them can be upgraded and 
customized. 
 
Zeru is given a simple robot and has to 
participate in tournaments to earn money and 
collect new ones. He gets to meet Juno who gets 
kidnapped and a man called Dr. T tells him about 
the fusion that brought past, present and future 
together. By fighting in turn-based battles (with 
up to six-to-six match-ups), the player collects 
crystals left behind by defeated Zoids that can be 
turned into new ones by visiting the lab in one of 
the many towns. There, the robots can be upgraded 
too in different areas, with defensive and 
offensive elements, for both long-ranged and melee 
combat. Prior to each match players define the 
deck command. This affects the entire team, 
influencing the cash, salvaged parts or offering 
the possibilities to fuse all Zoids into a large 
creature. Each turn offers the player to attack, 
wait (and regenerate) or use an item. Some Zoids 
are accompanied by organoids, robot friends, that 
can fuse into the main Zoid for enhanced 
abilities. 
 
The main story mode takes place in 40 villages 
with 151 base Zoids to collect. There is also a 
challenge mode with consecutive, increasingly 
difficult battles, and multiplayer through the 
link cable. Except for fighting, this mode can 
also be used to trade Zoids and parts.

Z.O.E. 2173 Testament (c) Feb 26, 2002 Konami 
  Computer Entertainment Japan Co., Ltd. / Konami 
  Digital Entertainment, Inc. 
 
In the distant future, mankind is at the brink of 
war with it's colonies on the moon, Mars and 
Jupiter. You take control of a young man who, 
after a series of events, finds himself in 
possession of a new type of L.E.V. (a giant combat 
robot) and stranded on Mars, where he joins forces 
with the Anti-Terrestrial League. 
 
Gameplay alternates between Story sequences and 
tactical turn-based combat in which you control a 
number of L.E.V.s on a square grid map. There are 
different types of L.E.V.s that differ in speed, 
durability, movement range and armament. Unlike 
close ranged weapons, long range weapons cannot be 
used after an L.E.V. has already been moved. When 
two units engage in combat, the I.A.S. 
(interactive action system) comes into play. When 
attacking, you have a limited amount of time to 
move a cross-hair over your target. Critical hits 
can be delivered by successfully aiming at certain 
weak-spots of your enemies. When attacked by an 
enemy, you must try to keep your own target icon 
away from the enemy's. The IAS can be toggled on 
and off in the options menu. 
 
At the end of each chapter, you can upgrade your 
L.E.V.s or equip them with certain items that can 
sometimes be found during missions. In the 
"balance" sub-screen, you can determine whether an 
L.E.V. should focus on attack power or accuracy, 
evasion or minimizing damage.
