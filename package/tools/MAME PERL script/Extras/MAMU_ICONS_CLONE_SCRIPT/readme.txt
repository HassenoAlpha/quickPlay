QP_MISSING_MAMU_ICONS_COPY_v.10

QP can't pick out parent icon if the clone has no ICON in MAMU_'s set

So this script does

This script has been generated against the mame.xml from MAME 141 against MAMU's ICON set 140u1. When I ran mine it only couldn't find 6 ICONs, so I include those too!

Instructions: 
*download MAMU_'s ICONS http://icons.mameworld.info/
*Unzip to a folder
*Put this script in that folder
*Run it

Script will create new 'clone' icons in the folder using the parent rom's icon

simple as that
