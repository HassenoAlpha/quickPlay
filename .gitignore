#Why are we not ignoring exe and dll files? Because this repo also contains the package files which DO include those, we'll have to be more specific

#Be aware that tools in PackageFiles/tools are standalone and if run up may start making their own ini files. We want to prevent this:
package/tools/Format History to Tab/FH2T.ini
package/tools/QUICKPLAY Multiloader/ForciblyWinmount.exe
package/tools/Romdata Magician/RomData Magician.ini


#QuickPlay puts its binary and resources in the packages directory when run up. But we want to publish QP versions without these files in. Quick solution: commit then replace working dir with commit
package/QP.exe
package/data
package/dats
package/search
package/temp

#None of these files in the src folder please
src/*.exe
src/*.dll
src/*.bpl
src/*.bpi
src/*.dcp
src/*.so
src/*.apk
src/*.drc
src/*.map
src/*.dres
src/*.rsm
src/*.tds
src/*.dcu
