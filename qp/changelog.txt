Major changes 'under the hood'! Heres the list!

* Finally got round to creating some decent looking background images for Quickplay.
* New emulator property - enclose ROM path in speech marks, for added compatibility with emulators.
* New Emulator propery - supports command-lines, now emulators can be marked as explicitly supporting command lines, or not - in which case Quickplay will try to filter out these emulators when you try to run a ROM.
* New Emulator property - Homepage, which obviously allows you to visit the emulator homepage (homepages have been added to the Emu-Finder data files so they can be automatically set up for supported emulators)
* Added Year property for ROMS.
* Emulator management dialog completely rewritten.
* Favourites dialog has been rewritten, and you can now have as many favourites as you want.
* MAME game renamer rewritten and is faster and now includes year information too for every MAME ROM
* Changes to the directory tree. It's now a virtual treeview (so its faster) and it has a new 'branch', emulators, which lists all available emulators (filtered by system) so you can just run an emulator without any special parameters - which makes it suitable for emulators which dont support command lines.
* The ROM filter now includes any ROM which has the search criteria in it. If you want the functionality of the old filter style, simply click on the rom listing and start typing - yes incremental search is back!
* Moved the options around (again), and I think I'm finally happy with where things are!
* Mass file zipper now has configurable levels of compression.
