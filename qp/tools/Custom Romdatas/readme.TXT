**************This is just a readme file***************
*********Close me to continue back to QuickPlay********

QuickPlay can be setup for a lot of pre-made romdata files
For example: 
Gamebase Databases (24 of them)
MAME
MESS
Lots of Arcade Emus:
CPS3
Sega M2
Nebul
FBA
Zinc
Winkawaks
Nebula

and more. Often they include other assets like screenshots and icons

AND come with full instructions

These are currently available at http://www.quickplayfrontend.com/index.php?showforum=16
