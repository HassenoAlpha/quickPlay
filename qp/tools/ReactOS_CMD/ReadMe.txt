How does the QuickPlay start command work?
When you first start QuickPlay, it will include two emulators under "PC Games" called Explorer and Start.
This is so you don't have to have a separate "Emulator" for each PC Game you have. Instead you call the game's .exe
as a ROM and use the Start command as the "Emulator". Alternatively if you have a windows shortcut to run 
(for instance if you have setup a windows game to get passed parameters by using a shortcut)
you can use Explorer instead of start if you want to.

You'll find the start command also setup here as a Tool in QuickPlay, so you can also call %TOOL:START% in a command
line if you need
