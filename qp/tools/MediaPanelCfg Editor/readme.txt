QuickPlay Media Panel Config Editor
by Matt McLemore aka Tempest

1. You can edit your MediaPanelCfg.ini by selecting a system, or open any .txt file via the open menu.
	(You cannot open a system from the MediaPanelCfg.ini that does not have a 'AddInfo' key)
2. If you wish, you can edit the text in the bottom half of the Gui.
3. If you edited a system, and wish to save it back to the same system, use 'Save'
4. If you wish to choose a new system to edit, choose 'New system'

The changes you make won't be reflected until you restart QuickPlay, but you can make a lot of changes FAST!
