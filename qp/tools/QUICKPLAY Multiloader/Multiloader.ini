:: PLEASE SET YOUR EMULATOR PATH AND OPTIONS HERE. ENCLOSE EMU PATH IN "BRACKETS"
:: Direct No Mounting is 1 if not using Daemon Tools, then I just pass romname to emu
EMU=""
OPTIONS=
NOMOUNT=

:: Or, alternatively, you can do this:
:: For V1.2 I added command line parameters you can call when calling the script. 
:: It will prioritise a valid filepath after "%ROM%" in the command line over what's in this ini
:: You must call them in this order: 
:: First "PATH TO ROM"
:: Secondly "EMULATOR EXECUTABLE" 
:: Thirdly "OPTIONS TO PASS TO EMULATOR (eg.:-CD)"
:: Fourthly "Direct Mount" - PASS IMAGE TO EMULATOR INSTEAD OF TO DEAMON TOOLS - 1 is yes, anything else is no
:: Please encase all 4 in "quotation marks" and include empty emulator options ie: "" if you need to set direct mount after
::
:: So in QuickPLay you would call, for example: "%ROM%" "C:\Emulators\Mednafen\Mednafen.exe"
:: (we don't need direct mount and there are no options)
:: Or "%ROM%" "C:\Emulators\Magic Engine\pce.exe" "" "1"
:: (we need the "" because we need direct mounting after)
:: Actually we can improve that one to pass -cd to Magic Engine:
:: "%ROM%" "C:\Emulators\Magic Engine\pce.exe" "-cd" "1"
