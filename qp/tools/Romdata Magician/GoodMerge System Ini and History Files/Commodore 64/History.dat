007 Car Chase (9892) (c) 1985 Coplin Software / Coplin Software 
 
Players control a car that must drive on the road along with other cars. To deal with them, the car 
is equipped with a smoke screen and weapons which players can use to kill them. From time to time, a 
helicopter flies overhead and will launch missiles and torpedoes at the player, but they can be 
destroyed with missiles which their car is also equipped with. If the player's car comes into contact 
with enemy fire or collides with other cars, the player loses a life.

Licence to Kill (4372) (c) 1989 Quixel / Domark Software, Inc. 
 
A "James Bond" action/arcade game based on the movie with the same name. Your aim is to avenge the 
death of Felix Leiter, who was killed by the drug baron Sanchez. 
 
Technically the game consists of several different vertical scrolling action sequences. In each stage 
you must fly, drive or walk through a preset terrain. While doing that, you have to shoot enemies, 
avoid their shots and collect items (mainly ammunition). Some levels rely more on shooting, while 
others test your reflexes.

1000 Miglia Volume I - 1927-1933 (6) (c) 1992 Simulmondo / Simulmondo 
 
Based around a classic motor car race from either side of the war, 1000 Miglia (literally '1000 
miles') is an unusual racing game. You have to progress across Italy through a number of stages in 
your rickety 20s car. Keeping within time limits at each point is crucial to staying in the game. 
 
At the beginning of the game, you can choose the spare parts that you will take with yourself in case 
your car breaks down. You also choose a car and set up the skills for your two drivers

Leader Board authors Bruce and Roger Carver tried their hand at tenpin bowling, in one of the game's 
earliest recreations. The process of bowling the ball involves timing a succession of clicks to set 
the right angle, speed and curve, similarly to Leaderboard's system. Three skill levels are provided 
- Kids level sets the speed and hook automatically, while Amateur has more margin for error with 
hook/slice than professional. The game is played from a plan view, with four other (empty) lanes 
visible. Single matches or a league structure can be played.

The sequel to 1942, which is still a vertically scrolling shooter, has the player once again fighting 
over the clouds during the second world war, this time in an intense battle just off the coast of 
Midway islands. 
 
Updates to the gameplay include an energy bar, which can be run down by either being hit from 
incoming fire or using a special weapon. The energy bar can be replenished by picking up power-ups, 
while special weapons (lightning, cyclones and waves) can knock down all fighters on the screen at 
the time.

1985 - The Day After (21) (c) 1985 Severn Software / Mastertronic Ltd. 
 
The control of Big Brother (referring to George Orwell's novel 1984, hence the game's title) has been 
overthrown, and mankind is self-reliant again. The first task in achieving this is to find the 
required quantity of energy pods. Big Brother stored them on caverns under the surface of four 
planets, and it's your job to go and find them. You will have to negotiate through tight sections, 
using rotational controls where left and right changes the ship's direction and up and down change 
its speed. When you find a pod you must engage the ship's tractor beam to claim it.

1994 - Ten Years After (23) (c) 1983 Visions (Software Factory) Ltd. / Visions (Software Factory) 
Ltd. 
 
You are Smiffy, a person locked in the world of George Orwell's "1984." The book's 
totalitarian-spying concept is updated for the early-eighties, when the game was produced. Instead of 
humans monitoring other humans through the television screen, everything is controlled by a Central 
Computer. Smiffy decides to turn the computer off, and your adventure begins. 
 
The game is a platform game.  In Orwell's book, gigantic buildings dominated the landscape, and whole 
worlds could be hidden inside them.  One of these buildings holds the Central Computer, and the game 
platforms are the corridors inside the building. You jump over monsters, duck flying objects, and 
work your way ever upward. Moving through the levels, you work toward the computer. 
 
This game came out in 1983-84, when people were looking at Orwell's book, and seeing that his 
predictions were not perfect. Some felt that he had got his date wrong. This game plays on that idea, 
by moving the date back another ten years.

19 Part One - Boot Camp (14) (c) 1988 Artronic Limited / Artronic Limited 
 
As one of up to four newly recruited soldiers at the time of the Vietnam War (these people had an 
average age of 19, as the title refers to), you must first face the tough Boot Camp. Conceptually 
it’s similar to Boot Camp, a fact which can’t be disguised even by the Konami game being known as 
‘Combat School’ in Europe. Show enough stamina, skill and determination in these four events and you 
have proved yourself worthy to fight for the US. 
 
First you must complete a horizontally-scrolling assault course, with jumps to make my holding down 
fire to get a yellow bar at the bottom of the screen (hold the button for too long or not long enough 
and you get a red bar and have to abort the jump, thus wasting time), and monkey bars to waggle your 
way through. Next up is a shooting range, in which you look through a sightscreen to target the 
enemies (and avoid the innocent civilians) as they appear on the large screen in front of you. 
Driving through an assault course is your third task, with damage-inducing hazards to drive around 
and stars to collect for bonus points. Finally you must do some hand-to-hand combat, before getting 
your final scores.

221B Baker Street (31) (c) 1986 IntelliCreations, Inc.|Pacific Softech Inc. / Datasoft, Inc. 
 
Based on the board game of the same name, 221 B Baker St. pits up to four players against each other 
in a race to solve mysteries set in Victorian London.  After picking a character (Sherlock Holmes, 
Dr. Watson, Irene Adler, or Inspector Lestrade), players select one of the thirty available mysteries 
and read its case file in the game's manual.  The case file presents the particulars of the case, 
mentions the people involved, and explains what the players need to deduce to win the game. 
 
Solving the mysteries entails moving around London (the game board) via a roll of the dice, entering 
locales to collect clues, and then piecing the clues together.  Among the fifteen locations available 
are a pub, a park, and a bank, and each location is brought to life with voice synthesis.  Each 
location will have a clue, but not all clues will be useful. 
 
Before solving the case, players must visit Scotland Yard for a badge.  Players might also want to 
use a badge to lock a location with a useful clue, requiring other players to detour to the 
locksmith.  Once a player believes they have solved the case, they must return to Baker Street and 
answer a quiz.  If the player is incorrect, the other players can continue.

Two Player Soccer Squad (15991) (c) 1991 
 
Most football management games written for 64K/48K computers concentrated their memory space on 
providing as many features as possible for a lone player. As the title implies, this game is an 
exception - 2 players each take control of a club, taking it in turns to make their managerial 
decisions and play their matches. For an extra competitive edge, they can include their own name 
among the players (which are otherwise made up of the real players of the day). 
 
The game uses a fictional 20-team superleague, with English and Scottish clubs, as well as a 
knock-out cup. You can buy or sell players, who have ability ratings out of 15, and swap your squad 
of 19 around to choose 11 starters plus 2 substitutes. Match scores are listed along with 
goalscorers, although the scorers update more quickly than the scores. You are kept up to date with 
financial changes after each match.

3-D Brickaway (c) 1984 Avalon Hill / Avalon Hill 
 
This is a racquetball-like game that is best described as a 3D variation of Breakout. 
 
You are at the end on a rectangular room. On the other end is a wall made of bricks or blocks. The 
ball travels down to the wall and knocks out a brick. It then returns to your end where you must use 
a squarish paddle to send the ball back to the wall. If the ball gets past the paddle, you lose a 
ball. 
 
In the computer version, you must knock out all the bricks of the wall to advance. Each level has 
more bricks per wall. You begin with 5 balls. 
In the console version, you must knock out 57 of the 72 bricks to advance. Each level has 72 bricks 
but the number of balls will lower in later levels. Level 1 starts with 99 balls.

3D Pinball - Pinball Power (5702) (c) 1989 Mastertronic Group Ltd. / Mastertronic Group Ltd. 
 
A standard pinball table is featured in this simulation, but with the original addition of a tilted 
view of the table, giving an illusion of 3D. As with any table, the aim is to get a high score, and 
this is done by hitting particular targets repeatedly. There are bonus ramps, bumpers, lights to be 
hit to increase your bonus count (which can be toggled using the left and right flipper keys). There 
is no 'pin' between the flippers, and no apparent tilt feature, meaning that luck plays a bigger part 
than in most pinball games. The ball is always launched at a standard speed on each of your five 
lives.

3D Tanx (7763) (c) 1983 dk'tronics / dk'tronics 
 
Tanx is the action game that let's you operate classic military tank. Standing in the front of 
seemingly deserted bridge the main and only task is to stop every enemy tank that's crossing over. 
You can move left and right (with the tank), up and down (with the gun turret) and fire explosive 
shells. Aiming of the gun turret and timing of the shot is critical for success because enemy tanks 
are moving in four distant lines. Also remember that direct hit to the turret is deadly for enemy (as 
well for you) whilst the tank hit to the hull is immobilised but still able to shoot on you.

As well as recreating off road racing, this game has considerable capability to upgrade your vehicle. 
There are four choices of vehicle on offer, each of which has its own weight/top-speed/build strength 
and so on, and thus is suited to different circuits. You can also buy upgrades and repairs, including 
carrying some spares. 
 
There are four completely different types of course, each taking place on a different surface - Mud, 
Ice, Desert and Mountains. Each of these is littered with hazards, which can either be painstakingly 
avoided, or driven through (with the resultant risk of damage).

Fifty Mission Crush (2713) (c) 1984 
 
"50 Mission Crush" was the name given to the crushed service cap of the battle hardened veterans who 
flew the B-17 during WWII. It was a mark of distinction and honor. The game "50 Mission Crush" is a 
role playing game that puts you into the cockpit of a B-17 Flying Fortress bomber during WWII. You 
are part of the 8th Air Force 306th Bomber Group and you must try to survive 50 missions (in real 
life the average life span of a crew member was 18.33 missions) in your B-17 (named The Impatient 
Virgin) over France and Germany. As pilot you will have full control of your bomber and 10 crew 
members, each of which plays a different role in your mission. After each mission providing you have 
survived you will be evaluated and awarded points based on mission difficulty, bombing accuracy and 
aircraft destroyed. The more points you receive the closer you get to being promoted. You start off 
as a Lieutenant and can make it all the way to Brigadier general. Also depending on how many points 
you earn in a mission you can receive a medal or if you are wounded a Purple Heart. Each mission 
lasts approximately 10 minutes.

letter. Below this is information describing the scene. The word in uppercase letters is what is in 
that scene. Pressing the letter again will cause the game to draw it bigger over three lines. 
 
Pressing a number takes children to the numbers section. Whatever number that is pressed will be 
printed in big letters on the right side of the screen. Like the first section, pressing the number 
again causes the game to print the number over three lines. Above this area is a blank picture, and 
when a number is pressed, a dragon will appear from the right side and flame the picture, causing the 
picture to reveal a picture with something resembling the number, and the dragon will be duplicated a 
number of times next to the picture depending on what number the child presses on the keyboard

In Acia you control a vehicle from a top-down perspective and must destroy all blocks in order to 
reach the exit. Most of the time you don't have direct control over your vehicle, that is if you 
press left, it will continue to go left until you press another direction or it hits an obstacle. 
Colliding with a block will destroy it, provided your vehicle and the block are the same color. To 
change the color of your vehicle, you have to navigate it onto specific fields. 
 
All levels contain various movable and immovable obstacles have to be avoided. To further complicate 
things, some levels also contain switches that open up new passages, teleporters as well two colored 
blocks that need two hits to be destroyed. Sometimes, destroyed blocks drop power-ups including a 
shield that protects your vehicle or a few seconds, a "fist" power-up that allows you destroy blocks 
regardless of your vehicles color and a "control" power-up that allows direct control over your 
vehicle for short while. Acia also features a two player mode and a level editor.

2. In the Slalom Race you have to fly a 'figure 8'. 
3. In the next event, the Ribbon Cut you have to break two ribbons. 
4. In the Inverted Ribbon Cut you perform the same stunt but flying the plane upside down. 
5. In the Ribbon Roll there are two ribbons in a row and you have to fly under one 
 
and complete a full roll followed by flying under the second ribbon. 
6. In the Under Ribbon Race you perform a slalom by flying in sequence under three ribbons. 
7. In the Under Ribbon Loop you fly under a ribbon followed by a loop and passing over the same 
   ribbon upside down. 
8. In the Spot Landing event you have to fly up to 2,000 feet and land on the runway as close as 
   possible to a marked spot. 
9. In the Flame-Out Landing event you perform the same stunt 
but then without the engines running. 
10. The tenth and last event, the Cuban Eight, you have to make a half-loop over a ribbon, 
    followed by a half-role, a half loop and flying under the first ribbon again. 
 
Some game parameters can be set. You can decide how the weather conditions are going to be. 
An instrument panel at the bottom of the screen contains several read-outs, like a altitude meter, a 
compass, an artificial horizon and a vertical velocity meter.

Colin mascot prominently. The task is to rescue Marti, who is trapped in one of the 150 houses which 
make up the forced-perspective 3D world of roads and buildings in the game. 
 
Colin is on his trusty bike, which must avoid oil slicks, other traffic and contact with walls, but 
can pick up Skips for an energy boost. Many of the buildings you can enter have nothing of interest, 
but many have upgrades for the bike. The most important of these are the headlamps you need so as to 
see into the darkest area of the game world.

Action Fighter (113) (c) 1989 SEGA Enterprises Ltd. / Firebird Software Ltd. 
 
This is a top down vertically scrolling shooter, in which you start off as a motorbike. You are quite 
vulnerable to attack at first, but power ups come in the form of a Sega van which you have to dock 
with. The first time you dock you get double fire, the second time gives you a rocket, the third 
gives a rear force field and the fourth invulnerablility. 
 
By destroying cars and bikes that appear on your way, you can collect A-F letters. Collecting A 
through to D allows you change into a sportscar which is less vulnerable to attack, but not as 
nimble. Collect all the letters in order to be able to transform into a high tech plane. This is the 
final stage of one of the five missions. Only the high tech plane can guide you to your destination 
in which your main target is hiding. 
 
There is also time limit in which you have to complete the mission. It is advisable to transform into 
the high tech plane as fast as it is possible. 
 
Picking up flags gives you bonus points with 10,000 points gaining you an extra life.

Decathlon (2057) (c) 1984 Activision, Inc. / Activision, Inc. 
 
The Activision Decathlon is a series of Olympic games similar to the Epyx games series. Up to four 
players can compete in the ten different events of a real-life decathlon, either in sequence or 
individually. Included are the 100-meter dash, long jump, shot put, high jump, 400-meter race, 
110-meter hurdles, discus throw, pole vault, javelin throw, and 1500-meter race. 
 
The flat running events involve simple joystick waggling, which must be balanced with 
accurately-timed button presses to clear the hurdles - hitting them or breaking stride causes a loss 
of momentum and thus time. For jumping and throwing events, you must build momentum by waggling and 
then press the button to throw or jump at what you feel is the appropriate moment. 
 
For each event, points are earned based on how well you do (this can be based on your running time, 
or how far you throw the javelin or discus, etc...), and the player with the most points at the end 
of the decathlon wins the gold medal.

Gomez who searches for his missing family members. To find them he has to explore different parts of

versions of the game this one is more puzzle-oriented, meaning the player has to find keys to access 
certain parts of the game world. Another big difference is that this version is not side-scrolling, 
the player is always sees the whole room and the game switches to another one if the player leaves

Addicta Ball is a Breakout clone with a twist. Players control a paddle to break down a wall of 
different block by bouncing a ball against them, but instead of removing them to clear a level, 
players need to make a path for the paddle to pass through. As time goes on, the bricks move lower 
down the screen so the path needs to be created as long as there is an opportunity. The game is over 
when the bricks hit the paddle. 
 
There are different kinds of power-ups, weapons, a thruster to move over the screen, and a barrier at 
the bottom of the screen that prevents the ball from disappearing, but it degrades over time. There 
are also some vehicles at the bottom of the screen that can be hit. Cooperative games for two players 
are supported.

the growing floors of the hotels. The game progresses when players throw three dice, two standard 
numeric six-sided dice, and a special color die. The two numbers on the standard dice represents the 
total amount of money players can spend on construction, while the special die tells them that they 
can build in any color group. During the game, players can take over each other's hotels and get 
Fortune Cards, in which players can take advantage of construction bonuses, natural disasters, and 
other events to add and remove floors. As with the board game, the first player to pass $35 million

Adventure Quest (149) (c) 1983 
 
The sequel to Colossal Adventure is an interactive fiction game with a VERB NOUN interface. 
 
The fantasy setting takes a clear influence from Lord of the Rings. After centuries of harmony, 
Middle Earth has hit problems due to a cataclysmic sequence of events - a crop failure leading to 
animals turning violent, and then an attack from a mysterious enemy to the north. The evil Demon Lord 
Alagiarept is discovered to be responsible, and as such the Wizards are given a week to beat him, 
before Middle Earth must surrender. 
 
You play a rookie magician with Meditation, Mysticism and 
Moneymaking skills. While the main war goes on, you attempt a much bolder mission - locate the four 
Stones-of-the-Elements and the Medallion of Life to enter Alagiarept's Dark Tower and kill him. 
 
Your quest will take you through Beaches, Moors and Rocky Outcrops, as well as more specific 
locations such as the Pillar in the Desert, the Cave of the Sun-Dial and the Mills of God. Wolves, 
skeletal hands, sharks and octopuses must be dealt with.

Adventures of Bond... Basildon Bond, The (638) (c) 1986 Probe Software Ltd. / Probe Software Ltd. 
 
The player controls Basildon Bond, whose task is to collect a series of codes within five hours, 
under orders from 'P', who had his codename changed to 'B' to confuse the KGB. To unlock these codes, 
Basildon must piece together several jokes, which are found in various rooms inside a television 
studio. Once Basildon has collected a joke, they must be entered in the main computer. 
 
Collecting the jokes is not an easy task for Basildon. For one thing, to use certain objects, some 
other object must be collected first. For another, moving TV cameras roam around in some rooms, and 
if Basildon comes into contact with any of these, he returns to the computer room and ten minutes of 
his time is lost. 
 
However, to deal with the cameras, Basildon is equipped with ten Cooperblasters which can be used to 
summon Cooperman. Once Cooperman has been summoned, the player is free to navigate him toward the 
camera, and once Cooperman comes into contact with the camera, it is destroyed. If the player leaves 
and re-enters the room, the cameras return and the player has to summon Cooperman again, wasting 
precious Cooperblaster ammo. Cooperman can only be summoned ten times, and the player is unable to 
collect more ammo, so they need to use Cooperman wisely. 
 
One summon out of ten introduces the player to another character known as Blunderwoman, who does far 
more damage than Cooperman because whereas Cooperman just flies from one side of the screen to the 
other in a straight line unless the player interferes, Blunderwoman flies diagonally across the 
screen and back again without the player's involvement, killing any cameras that she does not kill 
the first time. 
 
The game ends when the five hours are over.

Adventures of Buckaroo Banzai, The (10726) (c) 1985 Adventure International 
 
A tie-in to the 1984 film The Adventures of Buckaroo Banzai Across the 8th Dimension, you play the 
ineffably cool Dr. Banzai: radical neurosurgeon, cutting-edge physicist, nemesis of nefarious 
criminal mastermind Hanoi Xan and lead guitarist of new-wave sensation the Hong Kong Cavaliers.  
(Unfortunately, you'll have to take our word for it, as the game doesn't make much use of these 
qualities.) 
 
As in the wacky movie, your goal here is ultimately to overcome a potentially planet-destroying bomb 
set by the Black Lectroids, inhabitants of Planet 10.  Unlike the movie, you don't accomplish this by 
overcoming the Red Lectroids from the 8th Dimension with the assistance of Team Banzai and the Blue 
Blaze Irregulars  -- instead you wander an eerily depopulated town to procure the necessary 
components (gasoline, sand, bauxite and "a special catalyst") to power up your oscillation 
overthruster-sporting jet-car and transmit cancellation codes to the bomb. The game uses a simple 
VERB NOUN text parser and, on some platforms, illustrates the scene with static images.

Fi$tful of Buck$, A (c) 1985 Ocean Software Ltd. / Ocean Software Ltd. 
 
A bounty hunter must explore the desert looking for buildings – which include a bank, a cemetery, a 
saloon, an Indian village, a mine, and a fort. While searching for a building, he must shoot cowboys 
that get in his way. The bounty hunter has limited shots, so he must get some more. 
 
Once a building has been found, he can enter through the front doors and pick up the bullets and cash 
there. More often than not, the cash is out of reach, and in order to get it, our bounty hunter needs 
to navigate between platforms and climb ladders or gutters. Some buildings are occupied by their 
owner, who has orders to stop the bounty hunter from stealing his cash. 
 
There are two ways that he can die: being killed in the desert or falling off platforms at long 
distances.

Afterburner (9762) (c) 1989 SEGA Enterprises Ltd. / SEGA Enterprises Ltd. 
 
Afterburner is a conversion of the arcade game of the same name. The goal is simple: use your F-14 
Tomcat and shoot as many enemies as you can. This aircraft has two weapons: lock-on missiles and 
Vulcan cannons (basically machine guns). In some versions there is an option to let the cannons shoot 
automatically all the time. 
 
The game is viewed from behind the plane with you fighting wave after wave of enemy fighters. But at 
heart it offers the usual shooter mechanics, meaning you spend most of your time dodging and 
shooting. Sometimes you come across a friendly supply plane and if you dock with it you can replenish 
your missiles.

Year 2019, Manhattan. After a nuclear war. 
 
Out of the ashes comes a hero, Jonathan Rogers, better known as "Jungle Rogers", the owner of the 
asphalt jungle. The only chance of survival is to reach the airdrop platform XV-238, located in the 
control base of the schizophrenic assassin professor McJerin, and to escape to outer colonies. 
 
There is no easy way to do this. The game is a side-scrolling shoot 'em up, with thugs coming at you 
constantly, and a few moves to use on them. You must cross the dangerous streets of Manhattan, which 
have become over-run by feral thieves. Later he awaits for the guardians of the scientific complex of

Agent X II - The Mad Prof's Back (178) (c) 1987 Software Creations Ltd. / Mastertronic Group Ltd. 
 
With Agent X having been a success in both critical and commercial terms, a sequel was inevitable. 
The Mad Professor's cunning plan this time is to infect everybody with acne, thus causing the economy 
to crumble (and not just the economy for Valentine's cards). As with the original, the game is split 
into distinct sections - as with the original these are each loaded one at a time. 
 
The first section is a horizontally-scrolling shoot 'em up, where Agent X flies freely and must 
collect powerful weapons to be able to get through. This is followed by some platform action, which 
involves climbing a tower collecting code pieces along the way. The final section is a Breakout 
clone, pre-dating Arkanoid as the first game to give a plot behind basic brick-bashing, with the 
twist that a moving bat at the top of the screen fires the ball back towards you unpredictably.

Both games are somewhat similarly constructed, as they were built on an engine that is a precursor to 
Stuart Smith's Adventure Construction Set. Control multiple characters via a top-down perspective on 
various quests throughout the mythological past. Find items, increase your stats, battle monsters, 
and explore the land in these turn-based RPGs. 
 
Both games feature a cooperative component that lets any number of players play together, simply by 
dividing up the available characters.

Airborne Ranger (190) (c) 1987 MicroProse Software, Inc. / MicroProse Software, Inc. 
 
In this action/simulation game by Microprose the player takes the role of an U.S. Army airborne 
ranger. These Airborne rangers are dropped behind enemy lines by parachute to perform all kinds of 
dangerous missions. Gameplay consists of 3 phases: 
Reading the mission briefing and outfitting 3 supply pods with machine gun ammo, time bombs, 
first-aid kits, grenades & LAW rockets depending on this briefing. 
2. Flying over the mission map in a V-22 Osprey plane to drop your 3 supply pods and parachuting 
   out of the plane yourself. 
3. Performing the actual missions and reaching the pick-up point before time runs out. There are 
   12 different missions which include capturing an enemy officer, blowing up an ammunition depot, 
   photographing an experimental aircraft and liberating P.O.W.'s 
 
Missions take place in either an arctic, desert or temperate setting. Using the mission map the 
player must decide the route towards the mission objective. This might require them to crawl through 
trenches, run around minefields or take out enemy soldiers and bunkers. Airborne Ranger was one of 
the first games with some missions that required a stealthy approach (staying undetected until a 
certain time, taking out a guard and stealing an enemy uniform etc.). 
 
Airborne Ranger can be played in practice or veteran mode. In practice mode, gameplay is limited to a 
single mission, while in veteran mode, a series of missions or an entire campaign is played in order 
to earn medals & promotions. All missions can be played on several difficulty levels.

Alice in Wonderland (219) (c) 1985 Dale Disharoon, Inc. / Windham Classics 
 
Alice in Wonderland is an adventure platformer based upon the two Alice books by Lewis Carrol and 
created using the same engine as Below the Root.  However, whereas that game had more of a focus on 
role playing, Alice has more of a focus on puzzle solving. 
 
Puzzles come in a variety of forms including many inventory based puzzles, and more appropriately, 
given the subject matter, riddles.  Also, there are many physical puzzles primarily taking the form 
of how to get from here to there through jumping and using inventory items to change Alice's size. 
 
The plot is more inspired by the Alice books than strictly adapting them.  Especially the game tries 
to adapt Carrol's sense of humor in its rhymes and puns. Interestingly, Alice's end of conversations 
are driven by selecting emotions rather than typing words, and it is possible to anger NPCs and have 
them stalk off, leaving you to wait until a preappointed hour when they will reappear.  The time can 
be discovered by looking at one of the various clocks throughout the game.  Time is important because 
the game must be completed before the Red King wakes, although this isn't much of an issue especially 
since the game can be saved whenever and mistakes easily taken back.

colony until help arrives. 
 
The game play of the various Alien³ conversions varies from platform to platform. The Genesis Alien³

all the trapped prisoners and then make your way to the exit, all while surviving multiple alien

Aliens (c) 1987 Software Studios / Electric Dreams Software 
 
Electric Dreams' game based on the 1986 film Aliens is a first-person strategy game somewhat similar 
to Space Hulk. The player controls six characters from a remote terminal, guiding them through a 
255-room complex in search of the Alien Queen. Each character has a helmet camera and a smart gun, 
each controlled by the player acting in the role of overall operational commander. 
 
The player can switch to any character at any time, and must consider coordinating their movements 
and finding a safe location before switching to the next character. Characters occupy one room at a 
time, and can pan their view a full 360-degrees inside each room. Doors can be locked to halt Alien 
progress, or blasted open to get through (at the cost of permanently destroying the door). Alien 
bio-mass must also be destroyed before it spawns facehuggers, and the Aliens themselves leave lethal 
puddles of acid when killed (and so shouldn't be killed in front of doors!) 
 
Aliens prowl the complex and are attracted to gunfire. They will home in on nearby characters and 
attack, requiring the player to aim that character's gun to defend against the rushing Alien (a 
headshot kills instantly, while three to the body do the same).  If an Alien attacks a character the 
player is not controlling, they will "capture" that character (indicated by a yellow status light).  
The player must guide another character to the position of the hostage and kill the guarding Alien to 
rescue them.  If not, the captured character will be lost. 
 
Ammunition for all characters is limited, and refilled only by making a trip to the complex's armory. 
Similarly, a medical bay can replenish any damage. Characters also have limited stamina, used up with 
every move made. When stamina is low, the player must find a safe spot for that character to rest up. 
The complex also houses a generator controlling the lights, which the Aliens can destroy, or the 
Marines can then repair.

Alien Storm (12710) (c) 1991 SEGA Enterprises Ltd. / SEGA Enterprises Ltd. 
 
The aliens are invading Earth, and it's up to the "Alien Busters" to wipe them out and destroy their 
creator. The Busters consist of Karla, Gordon, and Scooter. Each one of them have their own weapons 
and special attacks. 
 
When you start the game, you can select any one of these characters to play as. There are six 
missions to complete (eight in the Genesis version) with several stages, and each mission has you 
blasting aliens all the way to the end, from the streets to the mother ship where you'll meet the 
mother of all aliens. Unfortunately, blasting these aliens will not be an easy task, as they get 
tougher in every mission, and are capable of hiding into objects such as plants, postboxes, 
trashcans, drums, and several others. Each mission has an objective such as rescuing people 
destroying an UFO. 
 
When you deal with a few aliens, flying heads will appear, which you can shoot to collect life or 
energy (by the way, life is important to you, since if yours get empty, you're dead). However, rather 
than using your ordinary weapons, you can use the special attacks that are enough to kill aliens you 
currently see. These types of attack vary depending on the character you choose at the start of the 
game. For instance, Gordon summons a U.S. Air Force Jet that drop bombs across the street, while 
Scooter is able to teleport out of his present location, and leave a series of bombs that will blow 
up aliens on sight, he will then re-appear. However, using your character's special attack uses up a 
lot of energy, and if you have little or no energy, you can't use it. 
 
At the end of some missions is an alien boss, which you must destroy in order to complete the 
mission. Also, at the end of every one, you have to enter buildings where you participate in a 
shooting gallery. The object is to kill aliens popping up from several locations with the building. 
 
You can play Alien Storm by yourself, or with another person.

Allan Border's Cricket (252) (c) 1993 Audiogenic Software Ltd. / Audiogenic Software Ltd. 
 
One of the few computer games recreating cricket, the traditional summer pastime in many 
English-speaking countries. The game had different licenses with well-known cricketers in different 
countries. It was Audiogenic's second cricket game, 8 years after the previous Graham Gooch's Test 
Match. 
 
All the international sides are present, with the chance to change the player data and choose the 
team yourself. Test match and limited-overs matches are available, with 1 or 2 innings per team, and 
you can turn the Leg-before-wicket dismissal off, which makes the game easier to understand. 
 
There are 3 skill levels - Amateur, Professional and World Class. The bowling involves positioning a 
cursor to place the bowl, then controlling the speed/spin (depending on the type of bowler selected). 
Batting involves timing one of the many available shots, and fielding is largely automated.

Alley Oops (254) (c) 1983 
 
Alley Oops' game screen loosely resembles a bowling alley, with the player moving left and right 
across the 8 lanes, with the ability to loop from the far-right to far-left or vice versa. Each of 
these contains sets of bowling pins, as well as harmful hazards such as wine bottles (which must be 
avoided - contact costs one of your five lives). The pins can be shot for points, using your 
seemingly unlimited supply of bowling balls. 
 
There will often be X or / symbols behind the pins, representing strikes and spares. Collect these as 
they fall to have them added to your scorecard. As bowling players may guess, points from a strike 
reflect onto your next 2 successful takes, while points from spares go onto the next one. Once you 
have collected 10 symbols, you have completed the level, and receive bonus points for the strikes and 
spares, plus an extra life. Losing a life resets the card.

In this coin-op conversion, you are a hero raised from the dead by the god Zeus to rescue his 
daughter Athena. With a scenery inspired by Ancient Greece, you have to fight hordes of undead and 
demons, with a boss at the end of each level until you meet the god Neff, who holds the girl captive. 
 
The title refers to your shapeshifting abilities. In this platformer, you can collect spirit balls by 
defeating two-headed wolves, allowing you to mutate into different beasts such as a werewolf, a 
dragon, a tiger, a bear and others depending on the version. Each form, tied to a level, comes with 
special abilities such as flight and powerful attacks, easily superseding the basic set of punches 
and kicks in your human form.

Alter Ego - Male Version (265) (c) 1986 Activision, Inc. / Activision, Inc. 
 
Alter Ego is a "life simulator" that presents you with a series of life experiences that take you 
from infancy through old age.  You can live out your own life, or the life of someone else, possibly 
someone you wish you could be.  You can live out fantasies without risk, relive your childhood, or 
maybe see the world from your kids'/parents'/spouse's eyes. 
 
The life situations you encounter have the ability to change or become eliminated based on previous 
decisions you make.  While the life you live is a fantasy, the actions you take have very real and 
thought-provoking responses.

Alternate Reality - The City (269) (c) 1986 Paradise Programming / Datasoft, Inc. 
 
In this old first-person RPG, you are one of many people who have been abducted from earth by aliens 
and transported to an alternate dimension where you are dumped in a strange, yet familiar city. Your 
quest is to explore the city, and find the clues that will lead you to your captors and help you get 
back home. 
 
In addition to standard first-person RPG's of that era, like skills, stats, experience points and a 
repertoire of shops and places to visit, the game offered moral evaluation of your character, and 
depending on your actions you would be good or evil, and that affected how the environment reacted to 
you. Encounters were not necessarily just resolved with combat, but you could also try to trick, 
charm or bribe opponents, and the storyline was very non-linear, for example allowing you to take a 
job in order to enhance a particular skill or just to pass away time. 
 
Alternate Reality: The City is the first part of an unfinished series of five planned RPG's.

Money must be spend on buying improved weaponry (including that needed to destroy the Queen Bees) and 
repairing the ship throughout the 2500 screens Amaurote is depicted in. As your main weapons are 
bombs, you need to consider their bounce and distance before firing, to avoid being caught up in

The main action in the game is a side-scrolling beat 'em up, in which you alternately control the two 
characters. They each have their own moves to deal with The Rhino, Electro and other foes. Moves are 
context-sensitive based on the distance between your character and the opponent. Energy bars decrease 
as you each take hits. After each section you get comic-book sequences as a reward, and to set the 
scene of the evolving story.

In the Amazon rainforest, a lone warrior has to face seven challenges, which basically involve 
killing creatures and obstacles that he will encounter. The warrior is equipped with a blowpipe and a 
limited supply of darts to fend off these hazards and help him survive. 
 
The first three challenges are set in the jungle, where the warrior has to deal with snakes, 
scorpions, headhunters, and spears. The fourth and fifth challenges take place in the caverns, and 
has the warrior deal with vampire bats and wraiths. In the fifth challenges, that take place in the 
ancient ruins, falling spiders and blocks of rubble attempt to kill the warrior. If he succeeds, he 
will have to defeat Quetzalcoatus, a giant bird who is desperate to carry you away in his jaws. 
 
To shoot a dart, the warrior must load the blowpipe first. The pipe can move through different 
positions, in an arc-like fashion. Also, the warrior has to shoot a certain number of creatures to 
proceed to the next challenge, with the number increases on each of the four difficulty levels. When 
the warrior begins a challenge, with the exception of the last two, he is given three lives and a 
fresh supply of darts.

Ambush is a "space shooter". The game is played on a single screen, with no scrolling. You can move 
your vessel all over the screen, shooting at enemies or avoiding collision with them. Enemies enter 
the screen from the top and move at various directions and speeds toward the bottom (they bounce and 
change direction when hitting the left or right side of the screen). When hitting one of them they 
"split" into smaller ones, which may have a changed direction and movement speed (this is repeated 
for the first and sometimes for the second hit). The sprites created from a first hit will not leave 
the playing field but rather bounce from the bottom edge, but the smallest, created from a second 
hit, will vanish once they reached the bottom. Those sprites which weren't hit at all will re-enter 
the screen from the top. The overall number incoming enemies increases over time (as soon as one wave 
was completely destroyed). The game has some basic sound effects (laser and impact sounds), but no 
music.

each of the weapons crates, before going through the newly-opened exit.  Guard droids must be 
avoided, but shooting them can leave them inactive for a short period of time, and they can now be 
shot or hit to push them in that direction, which can be used strategically to make more paths 
available. There is a 2-minute time limit on each level. Every 5th level has a nuclear weapon guarded

Three days ago, a space ship landed near a small town in America, and the whole population of that 
town have vanished. Three agents were sent to investigate the alien craft, but not one of them 
returned safely. Electrical activity has been detected within the craft. The scientists discover that 
the aliens are preparing for something, but they don't know what. 
 
An android has been sent to find out what the aliens want. If they turn out to be hostile, it has 
orders to destroy the ship. The craft comprises of twenty floors that the android can travel between 
using the elevator. The android is equipped with a map that shows only eight floors at a time, and 
each of the floors are color-coded according to the sections of the craft. 
 
Enemies are scattered on each floor, but the android has two weapons in which to dispose of them. The 
android can use his gun he carries with him at all time, and can be shot in a straight or diagonal 
direction.  He also has a limited supply of bombs, which have a built-in safety mechanism to prevent 
discharging by accident. They will only operate once when an enemy is present. 
 
Throughout the craft are recharge stations. If the android stands in front of them, your android will 
be able to recharge its energy, gun charges, and zap pulses. The zap pulses are used to manipulate 
certain circuits, but not all circuits are vulnerable to pulses. 
 
Upon manipulating the circuit, the pulse must be moved through the circuit, gaining enough energy to 
over-ride the controlling circuit. The time needed to over-ride the circuit is displayed on the 
monitor, and below the time is amps. When the android has enough amps to over-ride the circuit, the 
amp-meter will flash. The android should then proceed to the exit terminal at the far right of the 
circuit.

Angleball is a variation on Pool, using a hexagonal table with 6 pockets and 6 sides. The ball can 
rebound off these at unusual angles, making the outcomes of shots harder to predict. The basic 
objective is to pot all the balls, while failing to pot a ball in 3 shots will lose you the frame 
unless your opponent also fails to do this. 
 
The game can be played by one or two players, with the one-player game consisting of a sequence of 20 
different table layouts, each requiring its own style to win. Two-player games can take place on any 
of these layouts or one of your own design using the inbult table editor. Shot direction, speed and 
spin can be set on a general level.

Annals of Rome (315) (c) 1987 Personal Software Services / Personal Software Services 
 
Annals of Rome begins in 273BC and sets you as a Roman senator, with the ultimate aim of colonizing 
as much of the known world as possible, and retaining that power against Carthaginians, Vandals,  
Parthians, Persians and all the other world forces. You have a strong army at your disposal, and can 
direct your generals as to which countries they attempt to invade. 
 
The game is turn-based, and these turns operate in phases, beginning with the economic circumstances 
of population and tax income being decided - it's recommended to keep taxation taxing low unless 
things become desperate. The game then updates you on the statuses of your generals, and give you the 
chance to redistribute them to other parts of your kingdom. 
 
Officers may rebel and cause a civil war - fortunately this can usually be pre-empted. More serious 
are attempts to take land from other civilizations, which take place in order and include conflicts 
between other groups. These, like every element of the game, are accurately historically modeled and 
variable in time-span as a result.

Another World (319) (c) Dec, 1991 X-ample Architectures / CP Verlag 
 
San Francisco 2016. A series of earthquakes has damaged several nuclear power plants, and the 
subsequent nuclear contamination has forced the survivors to flee underground. Their only hope to get 
off the continent is to use newly developed matter transporters. However, these transporters require 
certain types of crystals to work. Since men cannot survive on the surface, the task of collecting 
the crystals is assigned to a cyborg. 
 
You take control of the cyborg and must collect different types of crystals in a number of 
side-scrolling levels, while fighting off mutated animals. Your cyborg can jump, shoot and use smart 
bombs that damage everything on screen. From time to time, extras appear that replenish some of your 
health or improve your weapon. If your weapon is at maximum power, you can also collect additional 
smart bombs. 
 
The main task of each level is to collect crystals and use them in one of the teleporters that can be 
found at each end of a level. 
There are three types of crystals that are used for different purposes. Green crystal teleport you to 
the other end of a level. Red crystals take you to another level and blue crystals are needed to get 
to another continent. Usage of the crystals is rather complicated as each crystal has a different 
charge and they have to be put into the right slot of the teleporters. Not paying attention to the 
charge may even cause the transporter to explode.

Ant Attack (321) (c) 1984 Quicksilva Ltd. / Quicksilva Ltd. 
 
An early isometric game that predates Ultimate's classic Knight Lore by a year. Used what it called 
the "softsolid 3d" algorithm to represent a large scrolling city from a switchable isometric 
perspective. The city, identified in the inlay blurb as Antescher, a combination of Ant and Escher, 
the famous visual paradox artist, is teeming with deadly giant ants. The player controls a boy or a 
girl and races around the city trying to find his/her lost half while jumping on structures to avoid 
the ants, or fighting the insects by either jumping on them or throwing grenades. 
 
Ant Attack, like most games of its time, was created almost solely by a single programmer, who also 
designed the graphics and sound. This game had a unique visual appeal in a time before isometric 
action-adventures became all the rage.

Apollo 18 simulates a fictional mission to the Moon in the early 1980's, following on from the last 
real flight (Apollo 17) before NASA cancelled the program. One of the game's key features was 
digitised speech, which sounds crackly like a real mission controller would. Telemetry screens 
provide realism, with the player having to set items and computer programs to get the crucial GO 
signal. 
 
The game is split into several sequences. First is launch, where pressing the button to stop a moving 
bar at the right point determines success. Course corrections and an orbital rendezvous (to undock 
the lunar module) are next. The player had to land the module safely on one of three possible landing 
sites before running out of fuel. The moonwalk was next, and must be completed in a set time before 
returning to orbit. On the way home the astronaut performs a spacewalk to capture and repair a 
satellite. Finally there is the tense re-entry sequence and splashdown.

challenge is that  the man behind it moves with it, but often in subtly different directions, meaning 
that smaller gaps can be quite treacherous to move through. On the first stage, the hazards are mere 
rocks, but you'll soon have to account for motorboats, yachts and sharks moving across your path.

You get an extra life if you clear 4 waves. They keep on coming and the object is to get a high 
score. 
 
Interesting key mapping on this game:  the bottom row of keys moves left & right, but they are mapped 
alternately so Z, C, B, M and SPACE move you right while CAP SHIFT, X, V, N, and  SYMBOL SHIFT move 
you left. The middle row of keys (A, S, D, etc) power the thrusters while the top row (Q, W, E, etc)

Events in the rural village of Ambridge have enthralled BBC Radio 4 listeners since 1950. The 
computer game re-creation casts you as one of the scriptwriters. The game is split into four parts, 
in which you control Jack Woolley, Elizabeth Archer, Eddie Grundy and Nelson Gabriel in turn. Guide 
each character through their decisions (from 3 multiple-choices), with the aim of choosing the most 
listener-friendly choices. Your choices affect the show's rating directly, as well as changing the 
forthcoming plot much more than in The Secret Diary of Adrian Mole. 
 
Characters can be removed from the show depending on how you develop certain storylines, but make 
sure not to axe the popular ones. Avoid offending special-interest groups, as the BBC comes down hard 
on writers who generate complaints. 
 
In some versions you can play the four parts individually

Each side plays as an Adept - a powerful wizard with the ability to cast spells against other Adepts

demons, common to both.

Archon (378) (c) 1984 Free Fall Associates / Electronic Arts, Inc. 
 
Archon: The Light and the Dark is a strategic board game with some similarities to chess. Two sides, 
a light one and a dark one, consisting of 18 pieces each compete on a board divided into (9 by 9) 
squares. You win the game by having one of your units on each of the five powerpoint squares or by 
removing all opposing pieces from the board. 
 
However, you can't just remove a piece from the board by landing on it. When two pieces clash, the 
outcome is decided in the battle arena during one-on-one real-time combat (just like in Star Control, 
also by Paul Reiche III). If the real-time combat takes place on a dark square, the dark monster gets 
a health bonus (longer life bar). On a light square the light side gains an advantage. There are also 
some squares whose color changes over time (from afternoon, to dusk, to night, to dawn etc.), which 
adds an extra layer of strategy to the game. 
 
Unlike chess the two sides are not identical. Both sides consist of mythological creatures. For 
example the light side has among others unicorns, valkyries and a djinni while the dark side features 
basilisks, banshees and manticores. The differences are not just cosmetic. Two special pieces are the 
light wizard & the dark sorceress, they can both cast magical spells like: imprison a unit on the 
board, shift the flow of time (change day/night cycle to your advantage), bring one unit back from 
the dead etc. 
 
The different pieces have their own movement restrictions regarding the number of squares they're 
allowed to travel on the board and whether or not they can jump over other units (like the knight in 
chess). Units also behave different in combat

Arc of Yesod, The (357) (c) 1985 Thor Computer Software / Thor Computer Software 
 
In Nodes of Yesod, a monolith was discovered on the moon that transferred data vital to earth's 
security to an alien planet. After an attempt to destroy the monolith failed, it was transported to 
its creators the Ariatans. Now it is up to Charlie to travel to the planet Ariat and prevent the 
Ariatans from accessing the data. 
 
Gameplay in Arc of Yesod is very similar to its predecessor. Seen from a side-scrolling perspective, 
Charlie has to explore many large caverns, filled with enemies and transporters, and find eight 
crystals that he hopes will help him destroy the monolith for good. To get rid of his enemies, he can 
once again control a device similar to the mole in Nodes of Yesod. Pressing up on the joystick 
releases a small sphere that can be moved across the screen (while Charlie stands still) and shoot at 
enemies. Once again, there are enemies that are immune to the sphere, including a spaceman who, when 
touched, takes away one of Charlie's crystals.

Arkanoid (398) (c) 1987 Taito Corporation / Imagine Software 
 
The original Breakout concept involves controlling a bat at the bottom of the screen and using it to 
catch and direct a ball so as to hit all the bricks which are arranged at the top of the screen. It 
was unpopular for over a decade, before Taito revived it with some new ideas in this arcade game. 
 
The game's plot redefines the bat as a Vaus spaceship, the ball as an energy bolt, and the bricks 
form a mysterious wall stopping the ship from progressing to safety. 
 
By the mid-80s, power-ups were popular in most types of arcade games, and Arkanoid features them. 
They are caught by positioning the bat below them as they fall (meaning that you risk missing the 
ball if you go for them at the wrong time). The power-ups include lasers (which are mounted to each 
side of the ship and allow you to shoot out the blocks), a catching device (so as to be able to fire 
the ball off at a different angle every time you hit it) and one that slows the ball.... sorry, 
bolt.... down. Needless to say, the game inspired tonnes of clones, few of which added anything else.

Armourdillo (412) (c) 1987 Codemasters / Codemasters 
 
For centuries, the peaceful planet of Mobanti lived in total isolation and tranquility, and had no 
understanding of war and destruction until an alien race from a distant galaxy known as the Milky Way 
invaded them. Mobantians had no way of defending themselves, so it was clear that extinction was just 
around the corner unless action was taken. 
 
The leader sent out scouts, who were wise in the ways of disguise and dexterity, to penetrate their 
strongholds to find out the secrets of warfare. The few scouts that has returns from their mission 
said that their world had been at wall throughout the entire evolution, and advances in technology 
meant that they developed weapons that were too powerful enough for their leaders to handle, and in 
one confrontation they destroyed their own planet. The scouts went on to say that they were the last 
survivors from that planet they called Earth. 
 
Mobanti's crust has very little metal, and that is way Mobantians did not built machines. Instead, 
the scientists have used biological technology to create living structures in the society. They have 
combined their old technology with this new machine's technology to create Armourdillo, Mobanti's 
first - and hopefully last – fighting machine. 
 
Armourdillo must be driven to the far left of each city to pick up survivors – by deactivating a 
force field and picking up the pods that contain the survivors - and drive them to the emergency 
escape tunnel on the far right. Only one survivor can be carried at any given time, and while it is 
doing this, the machine will be attacked by the alien forces, but Armourdillo has a unlimited supply 
of missiles which can be used to destroy them.

In part two, you start out in the jungle and must jump from rock to rock without crashing into 
toucans (shoot at them to make them fly higher) and being blown to bits. Then you have to make your 
way to the general's offices shooting soldiers on the way, and finally, locate the secret documents. 
When you complete the seven sections of Army Moves, you'll receive a higher bonus. 
 
Some versions have a high score table to record your achievements. The second section must be loaded

battleship to battleship in a hostile harbor. And finally, rescue as many prisoners as possible from

eagle are among the helpful objects in completing your quest. The game is largely one of exploration 
and object manipulation, with little combat.

Goscinny and Uderzo’s cartoon characters are from the only Gaullish village in 50BC able to resist

the pieces? 
 
In this arcade adventure, it all comes down to you. The fifty screens you must explore take in your 
home village, a Roman encampment, and the forests in between. You have five pieces of wild boar, and 
these are used as you become hungry. 
 
Contact with wild boars or Roman soldiers triggers a one-on-one fight with punches and kicks. 
Defeating a boar earns you another piece of food, to restore energy once all lives are gone. Some 
sections are blocked until you collect their keys. 
 
In the US version the character Asterix was replaced by a barbarian and the game's title was changed 
to Ardok the Barbarian.

Auf Wiedersehen Monty (494) (c) 1987 Gremlin Graphics Software Ltd. / Gremlin Graphics Software Ltd. 
 
In Monty On the Run the intrepid coal thief Monty Mole fled to the rocky island of Gibraltar. 
However, the Intermole agency is on to him, and his only hope of escape is to trek across Europe, 
collecting enough cash to buy the Greek island of Montoss and live there in luxury. 
 
This is Monty's third game, and the structure is similar to the previous two. It's platform and 
ladders based, with 80 screens each representing some area of Europe - the Eiffel Tower and the 
Leaning Tower of Pisa are among the identifiable landmarks. 
 
There are different ways of travelling through the levels - some bouncy platforms coupled with a new 
super-leap move allow for big progress to be made, while Monty can also suspend from the ceilings and 
dodge his way across. Monty can now fall without being hurt, although landing on water can cause 
multiple lives to be lost in quick succession. 
 
There are many items to collect  - the most important are Eurocheques for money and airplane tickets. 
Once on a plane you must fight off the encroaching Intermole planes for extra points.

Welcome to the world of Wally Week with his first game. 
 
Wally works on a car assembly line. In this platform type game you must help Wally build a series of 
ten cars. Each car consist of six parts that are distributed all around the stock room and you must 
collect them, and then go to the assembly area to place the parts in 
their correct positions on the car. Sound simple enough, but this is a computer game so nothing is as 
it looks. The factory is populated with robots, bouncing tyres and air cooling blades which kill on 
contact so It's going to be a long working day.

Aztec (517) (c) 1984 Datamost, Inc. / Datamost, Inc. 
 
Aztec is an Indiana Jones type adventure game featuring our hero's quest to recover a valuable Jade 
Idol from a maze. Armed with only three sticks of dynamite and a pistol, our hero must get by traps, 
animals (lots of snakes and panthers), and natives, and find a way to make it out alive. 
 
The value of the Idol is set on the level of difficulty and declines as the game progresses. Thus, 
the player is awarded with the speed of which a successful recovery can be made. Multiple commands 
allow for freedom of movement, and expand the adventuring side of the game. The animation used 
several frames for each creature. 
 
Although the game is somewhat easy on the lower levels of difficulty, the game appears impossible on 
the highest of the 8 skill levels. The creatures in the maze increase in number and speed, and tend 
to want to follow you around more. This is difficult however if you want to go to the lower level and 
there's a hungry jaguar waiting for you. 
 
You walk around exploring boxes and "trash piles". Sometimes a box contains something useful such as 
a machete, pistol, bullets, dynamite, a health potion, or the idol. Sometimes it contains skulls or 
bones, or even nothing at all. 
 
The game features some unusual traps. You can walk into a room and the walls start moving in on you, 
or the ceiling starts dropping on your head. If you don't make it out in time, your toast. 
 
When you die, you have the option of restarting using the maze you just died in. That way, all of 
your exploring is not wasted.

spear-throwing natives towards a pyramid which rises on the horizon.  Once this is reached, a 
vertically-scrolling staircase with falling rocks must be traversed, and then there are rooms to 
explore and deadly aquatic wildlife to avoid (among other dangers) before the game is through.  
Players looking for the adventuring equivalent of an Epyx sports game should enjoy this one.

You input text commands to control your bomber's altitude, course, radar, weapons, and so on. And, of

   enemies to dodge. 
2. Jennifer Rescue: Guide Marty's girlfriend Jennifer out of the house without her meeting one of 
   the four family members. Open and close doors to make the persons go from one room to the next in

3. Beat Biff: A side-scrolling beat-em-up sequence in the tradition of Double Dragon. Fight your 
   way through a grim 1985 by jumping, hitting and kicking at Biff's lackeys. 
4. Band Puzzle: Rearrange the mixed-up parts of an animated picture of the school band in this 
   sliding block puzzle. The clock is ticking. 
5. Hoverboard Chase 2: Another hoverboard sequence, similar to the first one, only this time set 
   in 1955.

Back to the Future III is a collection of four arcade games. Marty McFly and Doc Brown have traveled 
back through time to the year 1885 - and they're soon deep in trouble when they face "Mad Dog" 
Tannen's gang and have to find a way to return to the present. This game takes four scenes from the 
Hollywood movie Back to the Future III and turns them into arcade sequences: 
 
1. Buckboard Chase: Doc Brown goes horseback in an attempt to save Hill Valley's lovely school 
   teacher Clara. This game of quick ducking, jumping and shooting alternates between a 
   side-scrolling and a top-down perspective. 
 
2. Shooting Gallery: The name says it all. A classic game of aim-and-shoot, spiced up by hidden 
   extras and bonus targets. 
 
3. Pie Throwing: Meet the Mad Dog gang. They have guns, and you have... cream pies. It's an 
   isometric version of the shooting gallery, only with ammo. And the targets shoot back. 
 
4. The Train: Basically a side-scrolling beat-em-up on train wagons with some ducking and jumping. 
   Get rid of the mechanics and collect speed logs to push the engine to a magic 88 mph.

Bad Blood (550) (c) 1991 ORIGIN Systems, Inc. / ORIGIN Systems, Inc. 
 
A nuclear war has turned the world into a wasteland. The pure-blooded humans have retreated in large 
cities while mutants live in small villages on the plains where they make a living by hunting the 
many monsters. Now one of the human leaders, Lord Dominix, wants to start a war to wipe out all the 
"bad-blooded" mutants. Your village chief has assigned you with the task of preventing this war. 
 
Bad Blood is a top-down action-adventure. You can not create your own character but have to pick one 
of the three predefined ones: Varrigg (a strong green mutant who fights with his bare hands), Dekker 
(a human male armed with a knife) or Jakka (she looks human but can shoot laser beams from her eyes 
like Cyclops of X-Men fame). The choice you make has only a limited impact on gameplay and storyline. 
 
Gameplay consists of exploring the world map, visiting several cities and villages, talking with 
NPCs, picking up items and new weapons (like shotguns, grenades, Uzis etc.) and lots of real-time 
combat. Bad Blood lacks character stats and character development. The game has a day-night cycle 
which influences the amount of monsters on the plains and whether or not you can talk with some NPCs.

Bad Dudes vs. Dragon Ninja (15952) (c) 1988 Data East Corporation / Data East USA, Inc. 
 
This six-level action game was converted from a Data East coin-op. The gameplay involving beating a 
succession of guys to complete the level, then an end-of-level bad guy. The action takes place on two 
different levels of the screen, which can be jumped across or navigated using ladders. Moves such as 
punches and kicks are on offer. The control method makes jumping sideways quite tricky.

Badlands continued the Super Sprint lineage, but moved the game into a futuristic post-apocalyptic 
setting. The races consist of 3 souped-up cars toughing it out over 4 laps on one of the 8 tracks, 
which are viewed from above. Two human players can take part, but only the winner continues without 
using up credits, so you will only see the early races in two-player mode. 
 
You are armed with guns, which can be used to slow opposing cars. During the races spanners can be 
collected, which are then cashed in for upgraded turbos, improved weaponry and engine upgrades. 
Hazards on the later tracks include ramps, bridges, buildings collapsing onto the track and barriers 
which open and close in a random sequence.

Bad Street Brawler (15385) (c) 1988 Beam Software Pty., Ltd. / Mindscape, Inc. 
 
Side-scroller in which you get to beat up innocent people. Although it's seems kind of strange, the 
game is just that: walk around the street as a wrestler wannabe and beat up grannies, blind men, 
gorillas and other bystanders. But try not to get beaten as the granny attempts to give you some of 
your own medicine by flailing her purse at you. 
 
Kicks and punches are your basic moves at first, but as the game progresses and you advance levels, 
new moves and attacks become available, and new people to beat up as well. It's public mayhem way 
before the likes of Grand Theft Auto.

your wheelbarrow, while avoiding miners and moving railcars. You can deal with the miners by using a 
pickaxe to knock them unconscious for a few seconds. If you are trying collect a money bag but a 
railcar gets in your way, you can cling onto the ceiling while it passes by. If you drop off the 
handholds on the ceiling at the right time, you can also ride the railcar to avoid the miners. 
 
Once you do collect all the bags of money in one scene, you simply move your wheelbarrow to the next 
scene. In fact, you can go between the 3 scenes at will

Ballblazer (573) (c) 1985 Lucasfilm Games LLC / Activision, Inc. 
 
In the year 3037, the most competitive sport in the known universe is Ballblazer. For the first time 
ever, humans from the planet Earth have won the right to compete in the final round of the Ballblazer 
Championship, to fight for Earth's honor and the title Masterblazer! 
 
Ballblazer is a 3D futuristic soccer-like game, where the player (inside a Rotofoil) is set on a 
one-on-one 1,155 square playing field (the Grid). The objective of the player to kick a floating ball 
(Plasmorb) inside the opponent's goal (Goalbeams). A player may compete against a human or computer 
opponent. 
 
The Rotofoil is equipped with a multi-purpose forcefield. This forcefield when in short distance of 
the Plasmorb will act as a pull field, automatically pulling the Plasmorb towards to player. When a 
player in possession of the Plasmorb shoots, the forcefield will act as push field and launches the 
ball. When the match starts, the player must move down field and attempt to gain possession of the 
Plasmorb using the joystick and blast the Plasmorb to an intended direction. 
 
The player should also be aware that the Goldbeams move slightly every second and the distance 
between them will shrink. The highest scoring goals are goals made when Goldbeams have disappeared 
across the horizon (Over The Horizon/OTH shots). A player may also attempt to steal possession of a 
Plasmorb by rushing beside the opponent and blast the Plasmorb away. The game ends when time runs out 
or a player wins 10 consecutive goals. If the game ends in a draw, over-time will apply and the first 
player to score will win the game. 
 
Scoring 
 
Close-in goals - 1 point 
Goals near Goldbeams - 2 points 
OTH shots - 3 points 
Players may steal points from each other by making goals. 
The total combined score of both players cannot accede more than 10 points. 
A player winning 10 consecutive points automatically wins the game.

This puzzle game features four players, any number of which can be human or computer, and is viewed 
from an isometric perspective. The basic gameplay is very similar to Virgin's Spot license. Your aim 
is to take control of the largest area of the board, which is done by moving your pieces so as for 
them to be next to pieces of another colour, which will then become your colour. There are three 
types of move – short moves which also see you retain the square you were in, jumps in which you lose 
the previous square, and moves using the teleporting device to move a larger distance. There are over 
100 levels, which needn't be played in sequence. The board layouts feature gaps in, which must be 
incorporated into your strategy, to ensure that you don't leave a space next to a large number of 
your pieces, which would allow an opponent to swallow them up.

have to avoid. If you try to get a pink one, then you will lose a life. 
 
The second section involves you riding a horse across the screen, while shooting enemies that get in 
your way. If a bullet comes in contact with an enemy, then it is stunned and returned to its starting

Lose all of them and you are doomed to spend the rest of your days on Boot Hill.

Bandits are holding up a bank and have taken people hostage, and as a gunslinger, it's your job to 
shoot them. The bank has 12 doors, and the bandits are behind each one of them. When they pull a gun 
out at you when you open a door, you have only a few seconds to shoot them before they shoot you. If 
you shoot them too early (ie: before he sticks his gun out at you), it is considered unfair, and you 
won't score any points, but if you're too late, he'll shoot you and you lose one of your three 
lives.If you waste too much time, a bandit will come out from one of the doors and stick dynamite on 
it. You must then shoot the dynamite to get rid of it. 
 
If you're lucky, either a man or a woman will throw you a bag of gold coins. If you shoot any of 
these people by accident, you also lose a life. More often than not, the person will throw his/her 
hands up, saying "I haven't got anything". That's when they will be replaced by bandits. 
 
Some men will carry three to five pieces of gold on top of their heads, and shooting at all of the 
gold will award you with a bag of gold coins. Others will be tied up with rope. If you shoot the 
rope, there's more money for you, because not only will you receive one bag of gold coins, but you'll 
get three bags of gold coins. 
 
There are more than ten rounds in Bank Panic, and each one ends when a person behind all 12 doors was 
able to throw you a bag of gold coins. The rounds get difficult the further you get. For example, in 
later rounds, a few bandits will block your shot, and you have to then shoot twice. Also, regardless 
of what round you're on, you can shoot so many bandits before time runs out.

Barbie (621) (c) 1984 A. Eddy Goldfarb and Associates / Epyx, Inc. 
 
Barbie gets a phone call from her boyfriend Ken, asking her if she wants to go somewhere with him. 
Where Ken says depends on the current game being played, and can include going to the prom, going out 
to dinner, going to the pool, playing tennis, working out at the gym, or having a picnic. 
 
You control Barbie, and your job is to get her ready by going shopping and selecting dresses, 
swimwear, shoes, hairstyle, and other outfits. This can be done by stopping her car in front of a 
store and going in. You use the joystick to move the "hand" over the various items in the store. You 
can also select its color and pattern. Clicking on these will cause Barbie to wear it. If you change 
you mind, you can change into something else. When you wear something you do not need, there is no 
way that you can remove it. 
 
One of these might not be relevant to the situation, so common sense should tell you what you really 
need. Once you are done with all of this, you travel back to Barbie's house where you can find out if 
you have the right outfit. If you did, then you are shown a picture of Barbie and Ken having a good 
time. Otherwise, you are faced with the next situation.

This sequel begins in Skara Brae - recently reduced to ruins by Tarjan, the Mad God of game one. A 
series of seven quests must be solved before you can track him down and do him in. Missions involve a

Other improvements include auto-mapping, new character classes, magic spells and dungeon levels (84 
of them!) that vary in size and shape. You also get to visit more exotic lands than in the previous 
installments, for each quest takes place in its own universe: a forest world, a frozen wasteland, and 
one that's linked via time warps to different times on earth, from ancient Rome to the Nazis' Berlin.

pieces, scattering them all over the land. The Destiny Wand has protected the lands for 700 years, 
and without it the realm will fall into chaos. Thus it falls upon your party to reforge the Destiny 
Wand. Also, one among you must ascend to the position of Archmage and use the wand to defeat Lagoth 
Zanta. 
 
Bard's Tale 2 uses the same engine as the original with similar gameplay, but takes place in a much

Based on the 1986 Walt Disney animated movie, the story revolves around a mouse named Basil who lives 
in the basement of the famous Sherlock Holmes residence 221B Baker Street.  Basil's friend Dr. Dawson 
has been kidnapped by the villainous Professor Ratigan and he must search through London for clues 
that will lead him to the fiend's lair. 
 
The game is a colorful platform adventure through 3 locales:  London's shops and docks, the sewers 
and finally the den of Ratigan.  In each area, 5 clues must be found by exploring objects such bags 
and sacks, cans, jars and chests found in each screen with Basil's magnifying glass.  He must pick up 
clues to fill 5 pockets in his coat and then he will be able to determine if some are fake (as 
Ratigan has scattered 8 fake clues among each locale).  Fake ones must be dropped until all 5 real 
clues are found then you get a clue to the level exit to go to the next locale.  If you can't find 
the exit, each clue can give a hint as to what direction you should go in. 
 
Your energy runs down as you go through the multi-level platform screens and encounter Rattigan's 
goons but some objects will contain cheese which restores energy or mousetraps which when laid in 
path of the goons will make them harmless (though they take up a pocket until used).

Batalyx (650) (c) 1985 Llamasoft Ltd. / Ariolasoft UK 
 
Batalyx is a set of six mini-games in a single package from legendary coder Jeff Minter. Completing 
levels and sections of the mini-games earns part of a completion icon, with the game finished when 
five icons are complete. There is an overall time limit represented by a decreasing bar. The six 
games were: 
 
1) Hallucino-bomblets. The player controls a probe that moves by firing in the opposite direction. 
   A variety of strange enemies 
including floppy disks and pints of beer are out to stop the player. Shooting enemies earns credits, 
colliding with them reduces the number of credits. When the credit bar is full, part of the 
completion icon is awarded. 
 
2) AMC2 (Attack of the Mutant Camels 2) pits the player against the giant camels again. The radar 
   shows where the camels are, and they must be shot repeatedly to destroy them before they reach the 
   base at the right-hand end of the level. Completing a level leads to the warp section, where the 
   player must avoid the missiles. 
 
3) Activation of Iridis Base - the player must follow a sequence of joystick moves (with and 
   without the fire button) to control the photons, a bit like the electronic game Simon. The Iridis 
   Base is actually a pyramid, and the player views the game from the back of a camel riding towards 
   it. 
 
4) Cippy on the Run - The goat-like creature from Ancipital returns. It must turn all the floor 
   and ceiling tiles to a rainbow colour to complete the level. Cippy fires constantly to kill 
   enemies, which change the floor tiles if they come into contact. Bad tiles include the gaps and 
   "non-sticky" surfaces 
 
5) Synchro II - possibly the hardest of the six games. A series of patterened squares are on the 
   background and the player moves all of a pattern at once by holding fire and moving the joystick. 
   The aim is to synchronise the floor movement to stop the enemy probes floating around from moving. 
 
6) Psychadelia 2 - not strictly a game, more of a pause mode/extra. A small light synthesizer, 
   allowing the player to change background colour, symmetry and line length.

Bat Attack is a Galaxian clone, in which you control a ship that must constantly move left and right 
firing at a series of bats that swoop down with your laser, while avoiding their bullets. The bats 
swoop down until they fly off the bottom of the screen and re-appear in the group. One of your lives 
gets lost when one of these bats come in contact with the ship. Once you have wiped the bats out, you 
must then avoid the spinning discs that come down the screen. When you have avoided enough discs, the 
next level begins.

(...the car): Joker is chasing you and have to escape to "Bat"-cave. Avoid obstacles like police 
blocking the road and others. Part three, "Bat"-cave: A puzzle game where you have to find a certain 
item (belonging to Joker) amongst other items. Part four, "Batjet": Cut the ropes of the balloons 
which are filled with poisonous gas. Part five, the cathedral: Hunt down Joker. This part plays like

Battle Chess is a quite typical chess game, but it comes with a twist: all pieces are represented by 
small, realistic figures that walk around on the chessboard, and when one piece takes another, they 
both take part in an animated battle. There is a different animation for each permutation, depending 
on which pieces are capturing or being captured. You can also play in 2D without animation. 
 
The game's opening library includes 30,000 different moves, ensuring a variety of games will unfold 
across the 10 skill levels. 
 
Multi-player support can be extended to modem and/or serial port play.

Battle of the Planets (673) (c) 1986 
 
Battle of the Planets is based on a science-fiction children's cartoon series of the same name. 
Zoltar and his forces are attacking your solar system and its five planets - Xenath, Elias, Horaf, 
Olixal and Pete. As a G-Force space fighter armed with a Phoenix ship, you must repel each of these 
attacks, by destroying enough of Zoltar's craft to prevent the attacks from succeeding. 
 
The action unfolds through the window of your craft, with various types of enemy craft approaching 
and needing to be shot with your lasers or torpedoes. Once you have targeted an enemy, you must keep 
the enemy craft in your sights until it has been destroyed. There are five status screens to keep 
track of - shield strength, power stability, rocket status, laser status (it can overheat with 
constant use) and the current situation on the planet you are defending. 
 
To land on a planet you must fly towards its target on screen, and enter the docking bay. You will 
have to take out landers, using your rocket system. This is also your chance to repair and re-fuel 
your craft.

Battleship (13880) (c) 1988 Elite Systems Ltd. / Epyx, Inc. 
 
What can you add to Battleship over the pencil and paper version? A computerized opponent, fairly 
obviously, as well as the chance to play without using up the earth’s limited paper and pen 
resources.  The possibility of cheating is removed as well. 
 
Elite go beyond this by changing the shapes of the ships to be more Tetris style, and allowing these 
to be placed at each of the 4 main angles. A ‘Salvo Fire’ mode sees each player fire a succession of 
shots (each of your six ships gets four shots a turn until it’s sunk), meaning that strategic play 
involves firing on a wide range initially in the hope of finding a ship, before homing in on the area 
in the next turn. Finally, there’s an animated sequence for each go, which is depicted as an air 
strike. As well as standard two-player games, there’s also a multi-player mode in which the winner’s 
score accumulates until he loses, allowing for a “winner stays on” structure if there are 3 or more 
of you.

This side-view shoot 'em up involves trying to retrieve two nuclear weapons which have been stolen by 
terrorists. These are located at opposite ends of the playing area, so you can pursue them in either 
order. Needless to say, the terrorists have plenty of forces out to prevent you getting too far. 
 
Unusually, the game features both a helicopter and a tank - you choose either from the base, and can 
fly/drive back there to change. The best strategy is to use the helicopter to shoot out air-based 
enemies and repair the various bridges, then return for the tank. You get 4000 seconds in which to 
complete all this, and losing a life costs you 500 of these.

Battlezone (688) (c) 1983 Atari, Inc. / Atarisoft 
 
Atari Games' 3D tank game was ground-breaking when released to the arcades, and as such was converted 
officially to many systems. Earth has been invaded, and you and your tank lead the defensive effort. 
You drive around the battlefield from a first-person view, targeting and firing at tanks, planes and 
UFOs. You have a radar to help you see where the enemies are in direction and distance. Objects can 
be used as strategic cover. Controls simulate the tracks of a tank realistically, so the direction 
and speed settings are varied - combining forward right and backward left movements (as you can on 
keyboard versions) sees you change direction more quickly.

Bazooka Bill is on a mission to rescue General MacArthur who has been kidnapped by a nasty

choppers that drop bombs on him. He deals with them by mainly using his fists, although he can pick 
up a variety of weapons such as knives, machine guns, flamethrowers, and, of course, bazookas. All of 
these weapons have a limited supply of ammunition, so it is up to the player to use them wisely. Each 
level is completed when Bill finding the right position.

B.C. Bill is a collect-em-up about the daily struggles of our ancestors. As the caveman Bill, you 
  must compete with other contemporary species, such as the dinosaurs, to collect food. Whack the 
  food with your club and drag the food back to your cave before a dinosaur eats it – or you. But 
  food alone is not enough for survival, you must also hunt cave-wives to secure your offspring. The 
  procedure is the same here: hit the women with your club before they're eaten by a dinosaur, and 
  drag them by their hair back to the cave. Your score is calculated according to how many seasons 
  you've survived, how many wives and how much offspring you have.

A dictator took the control of a fortress on the island of Kuhn-Lin. 
 
Your mission is to storm the island and recapture it. This takes place over the course of 6 different 
sequences. The first sequence is Aerial Reconnissance where the fleet must be moved directly past the 
enemy or into a hidden passage. Optional is this Hidden Passage sequence, where the player will have 
to manuever around mines and torpedos. Once encountering the enemy, the General Quaters sequence 
starts, where the player controls anti-aircraft guns shooting down enemy aircraft. The next sequence 
is named Battle Stations and the player must aim and fire heavy guns to aim at the enemy ships before 
they get too close. Following this fleet battle, the player's fleet must be manuvered to the beach. 
Upon reaching the Beach-head, tanks roll out and the player must keep these safe from enemy fire. In 
the Final Battle sequence, the Dictator is holed up in the fortress of Kuhn-Lin and 10 different 
targets on the fortress must be fired upon to destroy it.

The Dictator from the first Beach Head game is back, but World War 2 is over. Giving himself a new 
name, "The Dragon", he seeks revenge against the victorious allied forces. To further these ends, he 
kidnaps hostages and brings them to his island fortress... 
 
Controlling either the forces of the Allied Commander (J.P. Stryler) or the Dictator (The Dragon), 
you will have to perform objectives across four different sequences, each with different perspective 
and controls. 
 
In Sequence 1 "Attack", the allies invade the dictators base with soldiers dropped from a helicopter. 
The allied forces must land their soldiers and then march them forwards taking cover at different 
walls. The dictator only has to shoot them down with a machine gun. 
 
In Sequence 2 "Rescue", the hostages are being rescued. The player who controls the allies will use 
the machine gun to defend hostages as they cross the open courtyard. The dictator can deploy between 
four different weapons: Man on top of wall, Tank, Truck and Trap Door, only one of which is on the 
screen at any time. 
 
In Sequence 3 "Escape", hostages are loaded onto the helicopters. The allied player will select how 
to place hostages on helicopters and then man the controls, avoiding attack. The dictator chooses the 
level of the automated defense and then aims his tanks at the helicopter. 
 
In the final sequence, "Battle", the allied commander and the dragon finally encounter one another 
deep underground. They will toss poontas (throwing knives) at each other until only one is left 
standing.

Below the Root (723) (c) 1984 Dale Disharoon, Inc. / Windham Classics 
 
Below the Root is based on Zilpha Keatley Snyder's fantasy book series "The Green-Sky Trilogy". 
Following the events in those books, The Kindar and the Erdling societies have joined together. 
However unrest and distrust still remains. An old woman, D'ol Falla has heard the words "The Spirit 
fades, in Darkness lying. A quest proclaim, the Light is dying". Choosing one of five available 
people (of different ages and of either Kindar or Erdling descent) either she believes can help, D'ol 
Falla assigns the quest of discovering what these words mean and how to quell the racial and 
political tensions building between the races. 
 
Below the Root is a adventure game and a platform game. Choosing one of five characters (each very 
different from one another), the player explores the tree-based lands Erdling and the 
underground-based lands of the Kindar. As an adventure game, goals are primarily accomplished by 
talking to people (though each character is treated differently by others) and finding the right 
items to use in specific situations, but also dealing with the challenges of level design in a 
platform game. 
 
Each character can obtain different items to help with their movement as well as psychic abilities 
such as pensing (telepathy), kiniporting (telekinesis) and grunspreking (plant manipulation). 
Violence is abhorred among the Kindar and the Erdling and violent actions tend to harm the player's 
reputation. Kindar or Erdling factions may kidnap the player's character if they wander into the 
wrong areas, throwing them into a local "prison house" from which they must escape. The player must 
eat constantly to retain their energy, however Erdling characters do not eat meat.

be done by going into the engine room and selecting the planet of your choice, and you can modify the 
warp and jump settings to get to the planet faster or slower. When cruising the planet's surface, 
your ship's alarm will sound if it detects enemy movement. This is followed by the drones chasing you 
and shooting you with their lasers. While fighting the drones, you can use the keyboard's function 
keys to either fire torpedoes or phasors. 
 
Also while transporting scientists, you must supply them with rations in order for them to survive. 
You are constantly running out of fuel, meaning that you need to stock up while orbiting space. 
Higher ranks have you rescuing more scientists and navigating an asteroid field. You have a specific

You can move up and down as well as left and right as you shoot them. At set intervals an alien will 
emerge from the main pack and sweep down towards you. 
 
Other levels feature Asteroids which split when shot, or a single ‘boss’ alien. Aliens with green 
eyeballs release power-ups, such as improved weapons, shields and bombs. You have a single life with 
which to survive the carnage. You get points for surviving as well as scoring, so slow but cautious

shooting them out one by one, Chase HQ-style. Avoid contact and stay on the road to complete this. 
Next you must cross the grounds of a mansion, shooting anyone who gets in your way. 
 
The final section is set within the mansion, and is first-person 3D, although with few movement

This sequel to Dark Castle has our formerly nameless hero now known as Prince Duncan continuing his 
adventures after he toppled the Black Knight's throne and was dropped by a gargoyle in Trouble 3. 
With Merlin's help, Prince Duncan finds his way behind the Black Knight's throne where there is a 
fireplace and mantle. At the start of each new game, Duncan tries to take a torch on the wall beside 
the fireplace, and the entire wall spins around to reveal a large Ante Room containing 5 pedestals 
for holding orbs. Your mission is to collect all 5 orbs to open a gate to lead you to a final duel 
with The Black Knight. 
 
This game has similar gameplay and 15 new levels - five of which scroll as opposed to the static 
screens of the past.  These 5 are: Swamp, Black Forest, East Labyrinth, West Labyrinth, and Black 
Knight's Showdown & The Final Battle.  There are different enemies and items such as multiple keys 
and a helicopter pack which lets you fly in the Swamp and Black Forest levels.  You must pick up Gas 
to use it also.   The game map is larger with longer levels.  Different elements present include  
weapons-based fighting, mazes, bombs which are used to destroy enemies or walls, and a health system. 
 
Some enemies will decrease your health when hitting you instead of killing you outright. Elixirs will 
protect your health but it will also deplete slowly over time and can be restored by picking up food 
or leaving the level. There is now the option to save your game but it must be done from one of the 
computers in the castle's Computer Room.  There's also a new practice mode to try out levels.  When 
playing in Advanced mode, there's a different ending to the game than normal.

This platform romp has similarities to Ghosts 'N Goblins, sending you on a journey to defeat the 
forces of evil. You start the game with nine lives, and you'll need them although there are only 3 
(large) levels, each finishing with a boss. All manner of monsters block your path and must be 
attacked with your horizontally-travelling daggers. Additional weapons can be collected, as can bonus 
orbs, and the chance to summon a spirit to attack for you on the toughest sections.

Footsy the Bigfoot has vowed to rescue his girlfriend, who has been locked inside a cage by a

this is that there are two breaks in the cable that need to be repaired. So Footsy has to walk 
through a series of environments in an attempt to repair the cable. In the meantime, he has to jump 
over lava pools, throw rocks at swarms of bees, and eat spinach and fairy cakes to replenish energy 
he may lose along the way.

Big Game Fishing (750) (c) 1991 Simulmondo / Simulmondo 
 
Finally, after months and months of hard work in the busy metropolis you have decided to allow 
yourself a vacation on the limpid waters of the south seas where you will be able to engage your 
favorite sport : BIG GAME FISHING! 
But natives won't lose a chance to make some money of you: if you don't want your vacation to end in 
1 day, you will have to catch not only a considerable amount of fish, but also the kind and the 
quantity of fish requested at the beginning of each day. If you should fail, you wont be able to pay 
the cost of your boat and buying gas, bait, etc... 
 
So, renting a boat for approximately $60, you are ready to catch such predator fishes as black 
marlin, blue marlin, swordfish, or tunny. The gameplay includes the economical and strategical 
management in the port or open waters and fishing simulation in the sea. 
 
In managerial phase you should buy an equipment necessary for the fishing such as Flares, Batteries, 
Lines, Fuel, and Sardines, examine the variable weather, set a destination point on the map, and 
navigate your boat to this point. You should have appropriate amount of fuel to navigate to open 
waters and between the ports. The biggest fishes are waiting for you in the northern deeper waters, 
so you will have to make a little money in the coastal areas before venturing to the north. Also the 
ability to send S.O.S. signal is available in case of very bad situation. 
 
In simulation phase you should mount a line, assign one of five bites, move the rod up/down, 
accelerate/decelerate the boat, throw a certain number of sardines to attract the fish, and catch the 
fish to earn the money and honour. 
 
The game has a three difficulty levels, it may be saved in progress and loaded later, and the highest 
achievements will be stored.

Biggles (756) (c) 1986 Dalali Software Ltd. / Mirrorsoft Ltd. 
 
WE Johns’ tales of a brave World War 1 pilot were updated for a 1980s feature film, with a plot 
involving Jim, Biggles’ brother who lives in that era. Jim travels back through time to warn Biggles 
of a spectacular weapon the Germans have created, with the intention of changing history – for the 
worse. 
 
The game is split into two separate games, and the first of these is itself split into three 
sub-games. The first of these is a side-view flight game, in which you must shoot down and dodge 
Fokkers who come at you from the right of the screen in your rickety plane, with a machine gun and 
bombs on board. Part two is set in modern-day London, and the characters must jump across a network 
of roofs in order to obtain a secret code. There are guards to avoid, and big gaps between roofs to 
avoid. The third part is a side-view game inspired by Green Beret, with a gun to fire at encroaching 
enemies, gameplay on multiple vertical levels, and grenades to collect. Lose a life in any of these 
and you will cycle back through them. 
 
The second game is a more serious flight simulation however. A helicopter is beamed back in time for 
our intrepid hero to use. You must first go to the Allied camp to get the secret weapon’s location 
(and you will need the password from part one of the game for this), and then head to that location 
to destroy it and save the world.

In this tie-in to the 1986 John Carpenter movie starring Kurt Russell, you must thwart the evil plans 
of Mandarin Lo Pan who has kidnapped two green-eyed girls in order to marry and sacrifice them in 
order to become mortal again.  You play as 3 characters, one at a time, in this action platformer: 
 
- Jack Burton, a burly but bit dumb action hero who fights with fists and later with a "Bushmaster" 
  gun.  Ammo must be found to be able to keep using it. 
 
- Wang Chi, whose girlfriend along with Jack's has been kidnapped, uses Martial Arts and later a 
  sword when found.  More swords will be needed as they will break after awhile. 
 
- Egg Shen is a magician who has vowed to stop the ancient prophecy from coming about, and fights 
  with magic bolts which can turn later on into more powerful lightning if magic potions are found. 
 
Each character has an energy status bar at bottom of screen represented by a Yin and Yang Symbol that 
slowly disappears but can be replenished by finding food.  A weapons symbol is shown if they possess 
it and magic potion symbol will give them extra strength if found.  You must alternate among the 3 
characters to keep their status from falling too low and dying, and each has to pick up their own 
appropriate weapons.  They all can move forwards and backwards, jump, duck and attack at different 
heights. 
 
They have to fight through several levels including the streets of Chinatown, where martial artist 
enemies await and gunmen that must be avoided until more experience is gathered. Further on, you go 
into the sewers where additional monsters must be avoided by jumping over them.  Then they will reach 
the rooms of the underground lair of Lo Pan where large-hat wearing elementals called Storms await.  
The final battle takes place in the Marriage chamber where armoured warriors and the levitating Lo 
Pan must be vanquished in order to free the kidnapped girls.

Boris the Bee (star of the first game) has been kidnapped by a gang of antisocial Chavs, and his 
fantastically-named cousin Barnabee must rescue him. 
 
You control Barnabee as he travels through the underground ant complex, which has two different entry 
points from the four above-ground screens which are initially in view. In the main bulk of the game, 
the side view screens contain ants which must be anticipated and avoided, as they reduce your 
strength. The action is rather frantic at times. At the risk of being pedantic, you need to touch 
flowers to restore your energy through pollen. 
 
The game arrangement is a maze, with many flowers which remove barriers elsewhere in the maze. Many 
individual screens are self-contained mazes, with barriers which are removed when you move or fly 
into them. In keeping with the maziness, many screens have more than 2 exits. Once you find Boris, 
you must guide him back to the surface at his speed (which, without being flippant, is slower than 
yours).

Darkness has descended on the kingdom of Beroth. The evil Tobias has summoned the Black Crystal in an 
attempt to get revenge on the Brotherhood of Wizards for refusing him entrance. With the Black 
Crystal in his grasp, he is able to bring down the kingdom. It is up to the player to venture through 
the many realms of the kingdom and recover the seven Rings of Creation, so that they can banish 
Tobias and his minions and destroy the Black Crystal. 
 
To do this, the player needs to get through six maps. The first map, the player must find some rings 
so that they can enter the castles on that map. While exploring the map, the player will encounter 
beasts which they must attack in order to continue. If they are killed, the player is returned to the 
sanctuary where he began the map. 
 
When you find the rings, the player is free to enter castles where they need to find more rings in 
the same manner. Some aspects of the game are in text adventure format, where the player is required 
to enter commands to proceed through the map. 
 
The final conflict is between you and the Lords of Chaos. If you win, the Black Crystal is destroyed 
and peace is restored to the land. If the player fails, everyone is doomed to eternity.

Blade Runner (814) (c) 1985 CRL Group PLC / CRL Group PLC 
 
Based on the movie of the same name. You have been assigned by the police force to track down and 
eliminate any replidroids that have landed on Earth. There are six types of replidroids, labeled 
Replidroid 1 through 6. The higher the number, the more intelligent it is. 
 
The majority of the game is viewed from inside your skimmer, and inside of your skimmer are three 
displays that you need to pay attention to. The main display displays a radar view of your area, 
allowing you to navigate the streets in search of replidroids (which are represented by octagons with 
crosses inside them). To the right of this is a smaller display which shows the whole city and your 
position in relation to the replidroid's. Below this is a text readout giving information on the 
number and type of replidroids within the vicinity. 
 
In the main display, your position is represented by a yellow cursor which you can use to navigate 
the streets with. If you find a replidroid, you can hover over it and press the fire button. Doing so 
will put you in pursue mode where you automatically land. 
 
After you get out, you must hunt down said replidroid in a busy street. There is a scanner in which 
you can use to keep track of where it is. The replidroid is represented as a green square. The 
further you progress, the closer you are to them. If the replidroid gets out of range, your skimmer 
automatically picks you up, and you have to hunt down replidroids elsewhere. Once you catch up with 
it, you must match your position with theirs and shoot at them in order to get the bounty displayed 
in the status bar. Your scanner also shows oncoming traffic that must be avoided. What it does not 
show, however, is people which you must dodge. If you crash into people, the game ends.

Blasteroids (826) (c) 1989 Atari Games Corporation / Image Works 
 
As the name suggests, this arcade conversion updates the basic Asteroids gameplay. That means to say 
that the main gameplay consists of flying through single-screen wrap-around levels shooting at rocks, 
which split into smaller rocks when hit, eventually becoming small enough to disappear. 
 
In this case the Asteroids are protecting Mukor, an evil being who is poisoning planets under the 
Colonising Corp’s control. 
Each level is split into either 9 or 16 sub-levels, which are chosen through a square in which any 
remaining level which is adjacent to the last level completed can be selected. There are 3 different 
ships (Speeder, Fighter and Warrior), which can be switched between at any time. Power-ups (including 
improved weapons, shield recharges and a faster thrust) can be collected by flying into them.

The main character in this old fashioned no frills shoot 'em up is a Rambo doppelganger, which the 
developers may have been lucky not to be sued over. The main player is surrounded by a large tank 
which moves around as if you are walking it Flintstones style. 
 
Gameplay follows the usual pattern for Ikari Warriors-style games - kill off the bazooka-toting 
baddies, which emerge from hiding places or enter the screen in waves. You can do this by either 
shooting them or running them over with your tank. Parts of the scenery often block your path and 
need destroying. Once you clear the level you are confronted by a boss, which in the first level is 
an enormous tank which you have to disable the guns of.

The first of Blinky the ghost's three outings, the ghost with the most has to progress through a 
series of levels and remove the hazards left by ghost-busters (who aren't called Peter, Egon, Winston 
or Ray for licensing reasons). He does this by collecting the right objects to cast the all important 
spells. 
 
The levels themselves scroll sideways and are layered with platforms. Making the task difficult are 
spiders, mice and the like - watch out in particular for the jumping frogs. Once the appropriate 
spells have been cast (involving lots of back-tracking to collect objects and bring them to the 
cauldron) the objects to make an underwater diving suit must be obtained.

Blitz (17090) (c) 1983 Commodore / Commodore 
 
Blitz 64 is a one-key arcade game, similar to Air Attack. 
 
You are the pilot of a light bomber aircraft. You are running out of fuel, and your only hope is to 
flatten the city to enable your aircraft to land. Bonus points are awarded for landing, or for 
obliterating King Kong while he is climbing a skyscraper.  It is a one-key game, which means you 
cannot steer the plane, you can only drop bombs by pressing the spacebar (or joystick button). 
 
The plane moves from left to right across the screen, slightly descending every time it wraps back to 
the left side. The lower the aircraft flies to more urgent it becomes to target the highest 
skyscrapers. 
 
There are two extra gameplay elements compared to 1979's Air Attack. The first is a big gorilla that 
walks from right to left, it will climb any skyscraper that is high enough provided that it is 
isolated. You can only bomb the big ape when it is climbing a building. Secondly, there is a big 
white cloud floating around, but it does nothing except obscure the view of your plane when you fly 
through it, making it harder to target the buildings below.

Impact is an old break-out style game. The user controls a paddle and needs to catch a ball with the 
paddle each time it comes down. When the ball hits a brick, it is destroyed (unless it's made 
undestroyable). Sometimes, a bonus will come out of the brick. This adds to the 'bonus score'. When 
the player collected one or more bonuses, he may 'release' them, and he receives a powerup. Each 
'bonus score' has a different powerup: the most powerful powerups need the largest number of bonus 
points. Impact comes with a lot of levels and a level editor.

Bob Holness hosted this fondly-remember quiz show, in which students competed to answer enough 
questions correctly to complete a run of answers across the board. This was the latest and most 
sophisticated computer version of the concept. 
 
The exact mechanics of the game have been customized slightly. You start by choosing a question, 
which are all represented by the first letter of the answer. You must 'buzz in' by pressing your 
letter to input the answer (don't worry about exact spelling). If you get the question wrong, the 
computer chooses a square (seemingly with no strategy). In two player games each player has their own 
buzzer , and a correct answer sees you choose the next question. A digitized version of Bob's face 
reads out the questions - just be careful if you get any where the answer is 'organism'....

Blood Money (874) (c) 1990 DMA Design Limited / Psygnosis Limited 
 
The speech in the introductory sequence probably sums things up best - "the biggest unanswered 
question is 'where is the money?" 
 
The player has 4 missions to take on, in each case trying to kill baddies for the money they have, 
which can be spent in the shop rooms to upgrade their craft. Energy is depleted by contact with 
enemies and the walls, although there are some baddies who simply hover on your ship and steal, 
rather than physically doing damage. 
 
The game is a shoot 'em up which scrolls both horizontally and vertically, while being viewed from an 
R-Type style sideways perspective. Navigating the levels sometimes requires the player to duck 
through gaps in scenery.

Blood'n Guts (870) (c) 1986 Greve Graphics / American Action AB 
 
Blood 'n Guts is described as "ancient barbarian games", somewhat equivalent to the Olympic games but 
played by vikings in various violent events. You start the game by choosing one of four prefabricated 
vikings and then its off to compete. 
 
Among the several events available to the player the most noteworthy are, perhaps, Beer Drinking and 
Cat Throwing, both self explanatory titles. The other events are comprised of Tug of War, Rock Roller 
(roll a huge rock up a cliff and crush your opponent with it before he does it to you), Tower Jump 
(jump from a tower and land on your head!), Human Hit (throw stones at a human target!), Mountain 
Walk (basically rope walking with some added violence), Pole Fighting, Axe Throwing (again at a human 
target!) and Arm Wreck (arm wrestling). 
 
Most of the events are of the "joystick waggle" type, as in you have to violently waggle your 
joystick to win the contest, which is most evident in the Tug Of War, Rock Roller and Arm Wreck 
events. Whoever wins the most events wins the competition while the loser loses his head!

Blue Angels: Formation Flight Squadron is an F/A-18 flight simulator, with a focus on Air Shows. The 
Blue Angels are the United States' Navy Flight Demonstration Squadron, known for tight maneuvers and 
precision flying. The game attempts to replicate this by offering formation flying, having to react 
and coordinate with other Blue Angels in the air. 
 
The player can practice any maneuver in the simulator: dozens of high, low and flat maneuvers, 
Diamond 360 passes, left rolls and 4-point rolls or an entire air show for example. Other than 
practice events, the player can perform an air show or just go for a free flight. In the air, players 
fly from a 1st person perspective inside the plane or a 3rd person perspective from a chase plane 
behind the player. Additionally there are 4 different camera views and 3 different gameplay speeds. 
After the flight, an analysis is displayed of the flight and the player's performance graded.

Blue Max (893) (c) 1983 Synapse Software Corporation / Synapse Software Corporation 
 
For those who know nothing of World War I or it's heroes, this game is named after Max Chatsworth, 
one of Britain's Flying Aces.  Chatsworth's fame began in battle, when he was out on a reconnaissance 
mission, and his squadron was decimated by enemy planes.  The pilot survived, and in the process shot 
down seven enemy fighters.  He shot down thirteen more the next month.  For these actions, Germany 
offered their Blue Max medal to anyone who could shoot Chatsworth down—and Chatsworth got a new 
nickname—Blue Max. 
 
As Blue Max, you go out on sorties—flying missions—attacking assigned targets.  Targets include 
bridges, buildings, enemy planes, tanks, bridges, anti-aircraft batteries, vehicles and ships.  You 
progress to new missions as you take out your targets. 
 
You must drop bombs to take out the ground targets, and this action also represents a key danger for 
you.  Unlike the modern bombers that drop bombs on targets far below, early aircraft engaged in 
semi-suicidal bombing runs.  The pilots started at high altitude, then tipped the planes nose 
downward towards their ground-based target, and pulled up before they hit the ground.  In the middle 
of the dive and pull up process, they released the bomb.  There were problems of coordination, found 
in the game as well—if you time it wrong, or start too low, you will crash. 
 
This game has aroused some controversy too, which supposedly caused it to be banned in Germany.  In 
the course of your missions, you end up bombing houses.

perspective, you can collect balloons to gain extra points. Collecting the balloons is made difficult 
by the changing direction of the wind. As the game progresses the challenges become more difficult 
and the enemies more resilient

Stir Crazy featuring BoBo (7431) (c) 1988 Infogrames Europe SA / Infogrames Europe SA 
 
The game Bobo is an cartoon style arcade game. 
The main character is Bobo - controlled by you - he is an inmate and has been sentenced for 17 years. 
In this game inmate Bobo must do many chores, such as peeling potatoes, ladling soup to his fellow 
prisoners, helping his fellow prisoners to escape, jumping electric wires and singing lullabies to 
his snoring cell mates. 
 
Besides playing all events it is possible to select and play just one event. 
Up to six player can play this game by entering their names. They play alternating not simultaneously 
 
Each event can be played by joystick or keyboard. The specific moves you have to make vary from event 
to event but it come basically down to moving the joystick or keyboard keys fast from left to right. 
To pick things up you have to move the joystick downwards (keyboard arrow key down). Tossing things 
is done by moving the joystick up (when using the keyboard you have to press cursor key up). 
 
Below you 'll find a brief description of each event: 
 
Bobo has a job in the prisons canteen. He must serve soup to the other inmates and keep their soup 
plates full. To do this Bobo must move around the tables. When his supply of soup is empty he must 
refill it at the top of the screen where a new supply of soup is available. If his fellow inmates 
demand more soup they  start banging and hammering on the tables. The score of this event is based on 
how many plates of soup he hands out. 
 
Peeling potatoes is not Bobo's favorite chore but he has to do it. He has to pick up a potato, then 
peeling it and when that's done tossing it away. Bobo scores points based on the number of potatoes 
he has peeled. If a potato is not fully peeled it will be tossed back. 
 
In the next event Bobo must help his inmates to escape prison. The inmates are jumping out of their 
cell windows and it is Bobo's task to get them over the prison wall by moving a trampoline around. 
The score is based on how many inmates actually can escape. Bobo must be sure to catch the inmates 
under the right angle with his trampoline because if he fails the inmates will crash into the prison 
wall. 
 
Finally, Bobo found an way to escape prison. He must jump from wire to wire and as the wires are 
electrified he must take care not to be electrocuted. The score in this event based on how long Bobo 
can prevent being electrocuted. Bonus points can be earned by picking up the green objects that 
appear occasionally on the wires 
 
In the last event Bobo has been captured by the police and returned to his cell. He can't sleep 
because his cell mates are snoring and to stop it he has to sing lullabies to them. He has to climb 
the beds and not wake his cell mates by stumbling around his cell. When all cell mates are fast 
asleep Bobo himself must go to bed to get some rest himself. The score in this event is based on the 
time Bobo is actually able to sleep himself.

Bob Winner is searching for a lost civilisation somewhere in the desert, and has to gain three keys 
to access it by beating a boss in Paris, London, and New York respectively. The first two bosses are 
boxers, the last one is a gun-toting cowboy. The items necessary to beat the bosses are found on the 
preceding screens. 
 
So far the rather weak story for this typical French side-view flip-screen action adventure that 
focuses not so much on combat but on avoiding rather unmotivated rolling barrels and flying insects 
and is remarkable mainly because of its at the time outstanding graphics.

Bowls is a game based on the sport with the same name. You start by rolling a small white ball (known 
as the jack). Once it has come to rest the players roll bigger and heavier bowls towards the jack. 
After each competitor has used up their allocated number of bowls,one player is awarded points for 
the number of his bowls are closer to the jack than his opponent's closest bowl. 
 
The game screen is divided in three parts. Half of it is the lane viewed from a top down perspective, 
with two markers one for the position of the player and the other for the direction. The upper right 
part of the screen is where you change you position, direction and spin. The lower right part of the 
screen shows the player from the sideline. It can be played on different lanes (inside, outside and 
beach) and can be played against the computer or another player.

Boggit, The (931) (c) 1986 Delta 4 Interactive / CRL Group PLC 
 
After Bored of the Rings parodied JRR Tolkien's classic Lord of the Rings series, Delta 4 did the 
same thing with its predecessor The Hobbit, preceding New Line Cinema's identical sequence by 20 
years. There is a logical 3-part structure to the adventure, but there are also jokes such as the Old 
Ford location on the map being near a New Ford - a new Ford Sierra car. 
 
This interactive fiction with graphics game thus features reluctant adventurer Bimbo Faggins and 
devious magician Grandalf attempting to gain treasure, ultimately by appearing on a TV game show. 
VERB NOUN inputs are used for most instructions, although you have to TALK someone before SAYing 
anything to them. EXAMINEing objects is crucial to progress, and to finding the best jokes.

In Bomb Jack, the player controls Jack, who must collect all the bombs in order to complete the 
current round and go onto the next one. This sounds easy, right? Wrong! Making Jack's task difficult 
are numerous enemies such as birds, mummies, turtles, and orbs. 
 
In each round, collecting a number of bombs results in a bonus coin appearing, and collecting this 
coin will make the player's score increase 2 to 4 times. More often than not, the "power ball" 
appears, and when you collect this, you can defeat enemies and have more time to collect all the 
bombs. There is also the "E" coin, which gives Jack one additional life, but rarely does this coin 
appear. 
 
The more you progress through the game, the more difficult it becomes, as enemies travel more quickly 
to get you.

Having saved the world in the first game, Bomb Jack is out to collect as much gold as possible, which 
is lying on a number of ledges. These vary between open and shut - the open ones offer more points, 
and an extra life is on offer for collecting 10 in a row, so if possible the route should take in the 
open ones in order. 
 
Gameplay differs from the original, in that Bombjack's movement is no longer free and self-propelled. 
Instead, he moves flick-style between ledges, so long as one is directly within one of the 4 compass 
directions. Baddies can be pushed off ledges, but this uses up some of Jack's limited energy.

huge blast radius that Bombuzal cannot trigger them directly - instead, he has to explode smaller 
bombs first and cause a chain reaction. So as one might imagine, later levels turn into loud 
blastfests that need to be carefully planned. 
 
Besides, later levels introduce all kinds of additional hazards and gimmicks, like ice floors, 
movable bombs, disappearing ground tiles, and much more. Nobody said being a pyromaniac is easy.

Mobo and Robo Bonanza are enjoying their favorite television show when the picture crackles and a 
shadowy figure of a mysterious stranger appears on screen. This figure asks them to collect certain 
items that he has placed inside various buildings to test his security force. If they return the 
items successfully, Mobo and Robo will be rewarded. The two of them state that they will get the job 
done in just three minutes. However, little do they know that each building is packed with security 
guards who will raise the alarm if they are caught red-handed. Fortunately both Mobo and Robo are 
equipped with bullets that can knock the guards unconscious for a few seconds. An $100 reward will be 
given out if Mobo and Robo are apprehended. 
 
As either Mobo or Robo, you must collect all the treasures before leaving the ten buildings and shoot 
any security guards that get in your way. Remember that you are under a time limit. An in-game map 
will help you locate the treasures. There is a bonus stage after three buildings, where the object is 
to collect the gold bars in a limited amount of time without  one of the three spotlights shining on 
you. If it is possible, hide behind open doors. If you manage to get all the gold bars, 10,000 points 
is added to your score. There are three of these bonus stages, but each of them varies.

screens of treasure. Once you have cleared each one, you have 45 seconds to escape the hold and 
prepare for the next one. 
 
The levels all feature lots of doors, each of which has its own key to open it - these are numbered. 
As only one key can be held at a time (pick another up and the first one returns to its original 
location), and many of the enemies are located behind doors, a great deal of strategy as to which 
order you collect these in is required.

inescapable. In these countries, innocent travelers get caught in the web of international espionage. 
This is the setting for Border Zone. Border Zone consists of three chapters. In each chapter, you

unique puzzles and goals. The chapters take place at different times and at different locations

The team's formation can be customised, and as outfield players are not limited to a single position, 
you can customise the team's strengths and weaknesses in quite a precise way. Matches are played out 
by listing scorers as they happen, and are followed by a full list of the division's other results.

Boulder Dash (994) (c) 1984 First Star Software, Inc. / First Star Software, Inc. 
 
You're Rockford and have to dig through monster infested caves in search of diamonds. In each level 
you must collect a certain number of these diamonds, in order to open a portal to the next stage. 
Enemies can be squashed by falling boulders, which are released when the ground below them is removed 
or they are pushed onto empty ground, but be careful because these can also squash you. In later 
levels, difficulty is increased by many puzzle elements and shorter time limits.

Rockford the Ant returns in another Boulder Dash adventure contains 15 new levels, in addition to the 
easy-to-use game editor. Players can build, save, and play their own levels. The software includes a 
feature to sequence your levels on a separate game disk. 
 
All of the elements and hazards from the previous Boulder Dash outings are back: The fireflies, 
butterflies, growing amoebas, enchanted walls, and of course, the boulders. New features include 
titanium (indestructible) walls, growing walls, and slime that allows boulders and diamonds to drop 
through it at a varying rate.

Boulder Dash  III (996) (c) 1986 First Star Software, Inc. / American Action AB 
 
The third part of the popular series, Boulder Dash III adds a sci-fi spin to the graphics (called 
MetalGrafik), with Rockford now wearing a spacesuit and running through a more futuristic setting. 
 
Other than that, the 16 new scenarios are similar in gameplay to the levels of Boulder Dash I and II: 
Rockford still digs through a series of caves to retrieve diamonds. Once he has enough diamonds, a 
portal opens that takes him to the next stage. Obstacles in the caves include boulders, monsters 
which will kill Rockford upon touching them (but which can be eradicated by crushing them with 
falling boulders - some of the monsters then release a number of diamonds), and green slime that 
spreads through the entire cave and blocks pathways. Additionally, every level has a time limit. 
Several puzzle elements add variety to the game, such as walls which will turn falling boulders into 
diamonds.

Bounce It (1037) (c) 1993 
 
Bounce It is a platformer that requires you to safely guide a basketball to a basket at the end of 
several screen-sized levels. Running out of time or colliding with objects such as glass bottles or 
laser beams destroys the ball. Other balls can be collected to gain points and extra lives. At the 
right side of the screen is a bar that gets constantly filled if the ball isn't bouncing. Once it is 
filled completely, the ball is destroyed, which means you have to jump every few seconds in order to 
make it to reach the exit.

Bounces (1043) (c) 1986 Denton Designs / Beyond - Challenging Software 
 
Bounces is a futuristic sports game.  Two players (one of which can be computer-controlled), compete 
against each other to earn points.  Each game consists of two halves of 90 seconds each, one from 
each side of the screen.  The winner is simply the player with the most points. 
 
There are two ways of earning points.  The first of which is to catch the bounces ball that bounces 
around the arena, and throw it through the goal slots, on your opponent's side of the screen.  The 
further into your opponent's half of the screen the slot is, the more points it is worth, bur the 
more difficult it is to get the ball into, particular as each player is attached to their side of the 
screen by a wire. 
 
The second way is to knock your opponent down, either with your fists, or with the ball.  Being 
knocked down reduces stamina, as  does straying too far into the other player's side of the screen, 
or colliding with the wall each player is attached to.  If either player runs out of stamina, they 
are unresponsive until they recover.

In Bounder, the player controls a tennis ball that constantly bounces on the screen. 
 
The player has to move the ball around between two bounces so it lands on friendly areas like grass 
or the main hexagonal-patterned floor. If it lands  hazardous areas like spikes and sand, or hits the 
enemies which move around, one of the seven lives the player starts with is lost. There are 
beneficial squares though - arrows which keep the ball in the air longer or teleports which clear 
part of the game. 
 
The 174 screens are divided into 10 levels - at the end of each of these there's a bonus screen.

Bounty Bob Strikes Back! is the sequel to Miner 2049er and features similar gameplay. As Bounty Bob, 
your goal is to claim every inch of 25 challenging mines. To do this, you must walk over each segment 
of the framework in the mines. To reach each segment of framework, you will need to figure out a way 
to jump, climb, or use one of the many devices occasionally available to get there. To you help you 
get around (or sometimes hinder progress) are ladders, slides, suction tubes, cannons, transporters, 
and other devices. Wandering about the mines are many dangerous mutants. If you come in contact with 
one of these, you will lose a life. Scattered throughout each mine are special food items

Bounzy (9551) (c) 1984 Loriciels / Loriciels 
 
Bounzy represents a duel between a human (player) and reptiles (computer) set in the multi-staged 
spiral building shown in plane. The human should collect all the items in the building, moving 
between stages by ladders, to progress to next level. Meantime, the reptiles are running much faster 
than the human and move towards the level where human is located. There are different types of 
reptiles: some of them can't use the ladders, but others can. The human should avoid the contact with 
reptiles, because a confrontation is lethal. 
 
The building structure and positions of items and ladders are randomly generated at the start of each 
duel, regardless if the player lost a life or started the game from the very beginning. There are 
four kinds of items: keys, amphorae, statues, and gems. Each of them brings a different amount of 
points. The player's highest score based on collected points is written in the hi-scores table after 
the game. 
 
The player's character is controlled by the four directional keys assigned to letters or by joystick. 
The difficulty level can be adjusted.

After the deck is shuffled, each player is dealt three cards. The next card is Briscola, and it

remaining deck is placed face down, covering half of the up-turned card. Cards have different ranks 
and different point values. The trick consists of two cards of each hand, and it is taken by the hand 
with highest card. Also, players are not required to follow suit. So, based on your strategy, you 
should collect more points than your computer opponent will do. The game was made in Italian.

Bristles (1125) (c) 1983 First Star Software, Inc. / First Star Software, Inc. 
 
The object of this game is to paint all the rooms of a building without losing your paint brushes 
(lives) and before time runs out. You and up to three friends can select from any of eight player 
sprites, male or female. There are six skill levels with eight buildings per level. After you finish 
a building, you will be given part of a special message. There are six messages, one per skill level. 
 
You get from floor to floor by way of elevators. Be sure the elevator is at your floor when you board 
or you will fall down the elevator shaft. There are also three ladders out of the basement. Watch out 
for Flying Half-Pints. They will appear on one side of the building at any floor except the basement 
and will move horizontally across. You must jump or duck to avoid them. 
 
Starting at building number two, you must also avoid Dumb Buckets. These will walk around and ride 
the elevators but they always move in a set pattern. Starting on building three and continuing every 
other building, you have to contend with Brenda, the superintendent's brat. She will put hand prints 
on your freshly painted walls, which will cost you forty points and require repainting to finish that 
building. You can grab the candy cane in these buildings and give it to her. This will stop her for 
fifteen seconds so you can repaint. 
 
Starting with building four, you must beware of the Bucket Chucker. Unlike the Dumb Bucket, he does 
not follow a set pattern, he follows you. You cannot destroy the Bucket Chucker but there are two 
ways he can be trapped. One way is to use the paint mixer, a square within a square. You touch it to 
turn it on for four seconds and if the Bucket Chucker touches it while it is on, he will shake for 
four seconds. You can turn the paint mixer on over and over while the Bucket Chucker is in it, 
unlimited times. Another way to trap the Bucket Chucker is to go to the basement, lead the Bucket 
Chucker to the ladders, go up a ladder, avoiding the elevator, then go left or right. The Bucket 
Chucker will then be stuck in the basement until you lose a brush. 
 
Starting on building five, you must jump over steam pipes or they will trip you, losing you a brush. 
In buildings six, seven and eight, your brush will run dry after eight, seven or six rooms, 
respectively. To refill, simply touch the large paint brushes in some rooms.

first game is arcade where you can sail right into the action, set your course, maneuver and fire 
your guns as fast as your crew can load. For authenticity and historical detail the tactical game 
puts you on the quarterdeck where you will make all the decisions real captains had to make. If you 
wish to depart from the historical ships provided you can design your own frigates and ships of the 
line from the keel up rigging, arming and manning them. The game ends when either ship wins or at 6pm 
whichever comes first. You will win if you sink the enemy ship or accumulate enough points to force 
the enemy ship to surrender. You will lose if your crew size goes below 1/4th of its original size or 
if 11 enemy crew members manage to board your ship and you have no standing friendly crew members 
occupying any of the first 10 boarding positions on your ship. if both ships sink or no one wins by 6 
pm the game is a draw.The game can be played by 2 people or against the computer.

Bruce Lee (1135) (c) 1984 Datasoft, Inc. / Datasoft, Inc. 
 
The late martial arts hero features in this platform game, with the aim of reaching a wizard in an 
underground lair, defeat of whom can offer him untold wealth. 
 
In each area you must collect the many strategically-placed lanterns before exiting through the 
newly-revealed passageway. Some rooms also have escalator-type sections to run along, and the 
standard (although slightly illogical in this context) ladders. 
 
On the way, you'll fight two enemies - a ninja and a green sumo warrior named Yamo. You can defeat 
them by punching, kicking, dropping on their heads or luring them into hazardous terrain, or even by 
making them accidentally hit each other. Even after they are killed, however, they keep coming back 
for more after a few seconds. Since they can move pretty intelligently (they even climb ladders), you 
should watch out for them. 
 
There are lots of hazards to avoid by either walking round or jumping - walls of electrical charge 
and exploding bushes for example.

Bubble Bobble (1138) (c) 1989 Taito Corporation / Taito Corporation 
 
Bubble Bobble is the story of two humans, Bub and Bob who wander into the mysterious cave of monsters 
and magically turn into dinosaurs. The only way to transform back is to reach the end of the cave... 
 
Bubble Bobble is a platform game, with each level being a single screen. The enemies must be cleared 
from a level to go to the next one. With one player controlling Bub and the other controlling Bob, 
the player can jump and collect items for points (such as fruit). The real power Bub and Bob have 
however is the ability to blow bubbles. These bubbles can be as platforms to leap on, or to trap 
enemies. Enemies trapped in a bubble must be popped by jumping into them, wherein they'll turn to 
fruit. Additionally, power-ups sometimes float by in bubbles. They include lightning, which flies out 
horizontally at enemies, and water, which drags the player and enemies straight down flowing over 
platforms. Taking too long to complete any level will summon Baron Von Blubba, who will float around 
the screen trying to destroy the player.

Buck Rogers - Countdown to Doomsday (1149) (c) 1990 Strategic Simulations, Inc. / Strategic 
Simulations, Inc. 
 
Awakened from centuries long sleep in the 25th Century, Buck Rogers becomes an ancient military hero 
and symbol of earlier times.  As he is brought up to date, he decides to join the New Earth 
Organization (NEO), to fight for his home planet. 
 
Once he had fought in the cold war, a pilot sent into outer space to destroy a Russian weapons 
platform.  He was successful, but his success destroyed the planet, as nuclear war was launched, and 
you went into a centuries long cryogenic sleep, abandoned by the people who could not retrieve you.  
In the centuries that he slept, Earth colonized the solar system.  There are large groups of people 
on Mars, Venus and Saturn.  The colonies once existed to bring resources back to an Earth that had 
problems sustaining itself. 
 
But the intervening centuries brought a power shift.  Now Earth is at the Mercy of the interstellar 
alliance RAM—formerly the Russian-American Mercantile, but now the superpower, based on asteroids 
surrounding the planet Mercury.  Mercury exploits the Earth for resources, at the expense of Earth's 
population.  Earth has fallen into barbarism, except for one small light—the New Earth Organization 
(NEO). 
 
These "rebels" consider themselves freedom-fighters, and they are fighting for Earth's freedom from 
the interstellar powers.  Call it patriotism, if you will, but Buck joins them—the only person alive 
who can remember when Earth was supreme and healthy. 
 
Your first task is to create a party of six characters. Then, these six new NEO recruits are trained, 
and are thrust into the battle for Earth.

or not, and both this and your stamina level must be kept high. 
 
You can practice your skills alone, or spar against the instructors or your friends. Finally, when

Buffalo Bill's Wild West Show (1156) (c) 1989 Tynesoft Computer Software / Tynesoft Computer Software 
 
Buffalo Bill presents a collection of six Wild West themed mini-games, which hang together around 
humour-lead presentation and backdrops.You can play as many or as few of these as you like, and can 
always have another go at them if you fail. 
 
First task is to throw knives at a spinning board upon which a surely-terrified and 
fortunately-skinny lady is locked  - make sure to adjust for the rotation that will occur in the time 
your shot takes to hit. You get points for missing as many times as possible before hitting. Event 2 
is based on shooting ability and is in two stages. First you must shoot the targets of criminals (but 
not innocents) as they emerge from the ground, next you must shoot the bottles they throw at you from 
over the horizon. 
 
Event 3 is Calf Roping, in which you must position yourself so as to be able to throw your rope 
around the poor cow's neck. This is followed by Bronco Riding, in which you must adjust your balance 
to compensate for the Bronco trying to throw you off, by pushing the joystick out to balance two 
bars. Level 5 starts off like the Cow Roping, as you jump onto a Steer, before a joystick-waggling 
section starts. Last of all is a side-scrolling game in which you jump onto a stagecoach which has 
been invaded by Indians, and beat up the hijacker.

A computer’s mazelike circuitry is infected with bugs, and you have been sent in to destroy them. You 
are armed with bombs, mines, blockades, and various types of hatchlings, which when released will 
track the bugs and hopefully stop them. 
 
The basic gameplay is inspired by Dynablaster, but it differs because there is more than one way to 
kill the foes off. Depending on which way you push the joystick as you press fire, you will either 
release a quick-exploding bomb, a proximity mine, or a hatchling. Collecting ‘EN’ symbols will 
restore your energy, and ‘IQ’ symbols increase the ability of your hatchlings to track and hit your 
foes. Be careful when placing blocks

Bulge (1172) (c) 1985 Choice Software|M.C. Lothlorien / Argus Press Software Ltd. 
 
This early simulation of "The Battle of the Bulge" uses a semi-realtime system for gameplay, 
consisting of 15 minute time-ticks and will jump to 7:00 AM of the next day as soon as midnight is 
reached. The game has a pause command, so you can examine the battlefield without pressure of time. 
Units are displayed as icons and represent a regiment, brigade or even division, each having a 
certain strength value. At the beginning the units are placed in their historical starting locations 
of Dec 16th, 1944. Orders are given by selecting an unit and pointing to a target on the map. The 
unit will then try to move towards the ordered location (or enemy unit), and engage into combat. 
During the course of the battle each side will receive a number of reinforcements appearing at 
predefined (historical) positions. Units will fight until completely wiped out. When this happens you 
will receive a message displayed in a ticker on the top of the screen. This is also the place where 
you receive information like weather reports, air support and incoming reinforcements. 
 
Victory points are accumulated by destroying enemy units and taking cities (each city has a victory 
point value). There are some special conditions for the German side, like not taking the city of Spa 
in time (with intact fuel depot) will result in decreased combat value for all units. The current 
points are displayed at the bottom of the screen. The game will end on Jan 3rd, 1945, also showing 
the final points again, along with statements which sides claim victory. You can examine final unit 
positions and restart the game afterwards.

Bullseye (1176) (c) 1985 Macsen Software / Macsen Software 
 
A computer game version of a famed TV quiz show based around the game of darts. The computer version 
features 2 players, both human-controlled - on TV there were 3 teams of 2 (one amateur darts player 
and one to answer questions) 
 
The first round uses a custom board which is split both inwards (4 separate grades representing 
30,50,100 and 200 points respectively) and around (10 sections lettered A-K, representing a different 
subject each). The first player must choose a category to aim at, and shoot a dart at it. If they hit 
one of the sections for that letter, they get that score and are asked the question. If they hit 
another category they get no bonus but are asked that question - if it's still there. Each players 
gets 3 goes at this, with increasingly tough questions worth 30,50,100 points. 
 
Round 2 involves each player throwing 3 darts at a standard board, with the player who scores the 
most getting asked a question, with the value of the darts on offer. If they get it wrong, the other 
player gets a chance, for the points THEY scored. This is repeated 3 times. 
 
After these 2 rounds, the player who is in front gets to aim at a board with 8 black segments, 8 red 
ones and the bullseye. The bully scores 50 points, the others reds score a randomly-selected value 
between 15 and 45, the blacks score zero, and hitting a red for the second time loses you that prize 
- hence the presenter's catchphrase "keep out of the black and into the red, nothing in this game for 
2 in a bed". 
 
Once the player has finished the round, they choose whether to gamble their score against the final 
Prize Board. 101 points must be scored in 4 darts (in the TV show it was 6 - 3 for each player)

Bully's Sporting Darts (c) 1992 Alternative Software Ltd. / Alternative Software Ltd. 
 
Do you like to play darts?  Would you like to have the opportunity to play darts on your computer?  
Here is your chance. 
 
This game offers seven scoring styles such as Golf, Cricket, and the normal 501 scoring style.  
Choose how you want to score the game and hop right in and play.  Aim your dart with your joystick or 
keyboard, then let it fly and hope you hit something good! 
 
The game automatically scores for you so if you do not know how to score a dart game, you can still 
play.  Knowing what you should aim for is helpful for getting high scores, however. 
 
The darts games included in this package are: 
 
1. 501 
This is the classic darts game where both players start with 501 points. Scores are reduced by the 
amount each player scores when it's their turn to throw. A leg ends when one player reduces their 
score to zero by hitting a double. A game is the best of three legs. 
 
Round the Clock 
The player must hit each number in turn, starting at one and ending with the bullseye. A game is the 
best of three legs. 
 
Football 
In this timed game, the number of each segment plays no part on this game. 
Each player has a designated 'goal' area. Players take it in turns to hit a sequence of beds 
progressing towards the opponents goal. The winner is the player who has scored the most goals when 
time is up. 
 
Tennis 
The player serving must hit doubles, the player receiving must hit trebles. 
A bed is highlighted on the board, this is the 'tennis ball'. The server has two chances to hit their 
designated bed to 'serve' the ball. If they are in successful the point goes to the receiver. If they 
are successful the receiver must hit their designated treble bed. This is repeated until a player 
fails to hit the ball. Scoring is as in tennis. A match consists of the best of three sets. 
 
Golf 
Only the numbers one top eighteen are used in this game, representing the eighteen holes on the golf 
course. 
The object is to hit each number three times, hitting a double or a triple counts as two or three 
respectively, starting at one and working through to eighteen. The winner is the player to complete 
the game with the fewest darts 
 
Cricket 
In this game the players represent the batting and the bowling sides at cricket. 
The 'bowler' attempts bowl the batsmen out by hitting the inner or the bullseye, the inner takes out 
one batsman, the bull takes out two. 
Meanwhile the batting player attempts to score as highly as possible, but only points scored over 
forty count. 
The team with the most runs after two innings are the winners. 
 
Snooker 
All numbers count in this game, numbers one to fifteen represent the fifteen red balls on the snooker 
table, while the remaining numbers represent the colors, sixteen being yellow and so on through to 
twenty being black. 
To score, or pot a ball, that ball has to be hit by the player in sequence. The red balls must be hit 
once and the colored balls four times (doubles and trebles count as two and three hits respectively.) 
Play follows snooker in that after a red ball is potted a color must be attempted, hitting a ball out 
of sequence ends a turn and forfeits points etc. The player with the highest score wins.

Bundesliga Live is a managerial simulation of the German Premier League ("Bundesliga") back in the 
nineteen-eighties, using real club and player names. The game gives you control over the following 
management aspects: player transfers, advertisement contracts, taking loans (and paying them back). 
You can also change the team and player names. 
 
Before a match starts you have to nominate the players which should take part in it. As additional 
options, and quite odd for a soccer manager, you may attempt to bribe the referee and / or choose to 
use doping on a maximum of two of your players. The attempt at bribery can be repeated as long as you 
have money left over. When using any of these special options you will receive penalties when the 
attempt fails (financial deduction and team performance hampered by drop in morale). Immediately 
after finishing your preparations and choosing to start the match, the result is calculated in a 
short sequence ("goal-counting"). This is accompanied by statistics about earnings and expenses 
related to the match day. Afterwards the results of the other matches are displayed, followed by the 
new ranking in the league table. Finally, the game will return you to the initial management menu. 
 
The games' graphics is limited to the usage of the standard font / colors (it has a character color 
swapping effect in the title screen and a character scrolling effect in the game over screen, also 
switching colors in-between the scrolling). It has no music or sound.

Burger Time (1198) (c) 1984 Data East Corporation / Interceptor Micros 
 
You play as Chef Pepper and your goal is to make giant hamburgers while evil eggs, sausages and 
pickles chase you around the game area. 
 
To properly make a hamburger you must assemble all of the ingredients together, dropping them from 
higher up onto the the burger area below. To actually do this you have to let Chef Pepper step all 
over the burger ingredients. As soon as an ingredient (a piece of lettuce for instance) has been 
stepped on, it will fall to the next level below. Falling food will squish any enemy following you 
and will also"bump" any other ingredient bellow it farther down. Also, as an emergency defense 
against the enemy food, you can collect pepper shakers which will allow you to puff out a small 
pepper cloud which will momentarily stun enemies, allowing you to walk past them. 
 
Higher levels result in new level design, faster enemies and more ingredients to assemble. 
 
The PlayStation 2 version is a port of the original arcade game and comes with a soundtrack disc, a 
DVD, a guide book and some other bonuses.

Burnin' Rubber (1200) (c) 1983 Nihon Bussan Co., Ltd. / Colosoftware 
 
Futuristic top-down scrolling racing game. The track has no curves, but narrows and widens. There are 
potholes, breaks in the roads and islands that must be swerved around or jumped over. Plenty of other 
cars abound, which try to run you off the road (and can be bumped off the track also).

Butcher Hill (1204) (c) 1989 Imagitec Design Ltd. / Mastertronic, Inc. 
 
Intelligence reports suggest that POWs have been captured and are being held hostage at the guerilla 
outpost on Butcher Hill. The game is divided into three sections. 
 
In the first section, players steer their dinghy along a river while avoiding mines and other 
obstacles. If the dinghy comes into contact with any mine, it explodes. However, when the player has 
collected ammo, the mines can be destroyed. Coming into contact with rocks causes the dinghy to 
bounce out of the water for a short distance. When a jetty appears, pressing the fire button allows 
the player to land and start the next section. 
 
The second section has the player finding their way through dense jungle whose path lead to the enemy 
camp at the base of Butcher Hill. Stopping you from proceeding are soldiers that have orders to shoot 
you on sight. Mines are also scattered around the jungle floor and must be avoided. If players were 
able to obtain a compass in the first section, their current direction will be displayed at the right 
of the control panel. Shooting all the soldiers in the jungle gives the player extra ammunition and 
stamina. 
 
In the final section, players need to destroy the enemy camp by blowing up huts with bullets or 
grenades. While they are doing that, they must also be on the lookout for any soldiers that tries to 
leave the camp to bring back more soldiers.

Cabal (1215) (c) 1989 Tad Corporation / Capcom U.S.A., Inc. 
 
Cabal is a coin-op conversion of Capcom's arcade game. The mechanics of the game are simple: shoot 
everything in sight! 
 
The hero (there is a two player mode) runs back and forth along the bottom of the screen, ducking and 
dodging bullets and grenades from the enemy. The roll maneuver from the arcade was not implemented in 
the PC version. You return fire by moving a target around the screen which also moves your character, 
so be careful not to run into a bullet. 
 
The enemies throughout the 5 levels, come thick and fast and there are loads of them, normal foot 
soldiers, tanks, helicopters and end of level bosses, like submarines and war machines. 
 
Just about everything on the screen can be blown up or shot. There are bonus points to be picked up 
for destroying buildings and weapons to be picked up from the enemy, such as machine- and shot-guns.

Caesar's Travels (14316) (c) 1984 Chalksoft Ltd. / Mirrorsoft Ltd. 
 
Caesar's Travels is a game mainly for children age three to nine, and starts off where Caesar the Cat 
left off. After being kicked out by Mr. McGregor, his owner, for smashing too much crockery in the 
kitchen pantry, in an effort to catch mice, Caesar is placed in the yard and must find another home 
to go to. 
 
Throughout the game, a series of choices appear and one must be selected with the function keys. The 
story being told varies depending on what choice the player makes. For example, the player may choose 
to climb the fence or jump onto the wall, or climb a mountain or walk along a path. 
 
More often than not, Caesar is faced with a problem-solving question that usually requires the player 
to count the total number of items on the screen, and what object can they see on screen. There are 
38 routes through the game and 18 different endings, all happy and non-violent - a point in the 
game's favor.

Caesar the Cat (1221) (c) 1983 Novotrade International, Inc. / Mirrorsoft Ltd. 
 
Players control Caesar the Cat, who must stop mice from eating food in the cupboard. This can be done 
by coming into contact with the mice so that Caesar has them in its mouth, and then carrying them to 
the larder door that appears on the side of the screen when you do so. There are three types of mice, 
and the amount of points you get for carrying them to the larder door depends on the type caught, 
with the highest scoring mouse rather difficult to catch. Players can hold down the fire button to 
increase Caesar's speed so that they can easily catch the mice, but they must also avoid knocking the 
jars off the cupboard. 
 
A timer is present, and it counts down during the game. The time increases for each mouse the player 
successfully carried to the larder door, but decreases when the mice completely eats the food, when 
players knock jars down, or when they try to move past the game screen. The game ends when the timer 
reaches zero.

flying robot hats and green dinosaurs. Players start off wearing a sleeveless blue suit which has no 
weapons, leaving them with no choice but to jump over these enemies. However, there are two types of 
pads that can be stepped on to give you different suits, and these suits give you weapons which can 
be used to destroy the enemies with. 
 
When killed, most of the dinosaurs will drop a flashing P icon, and when it is collected, the suit 
will flash for a few seconds and the player can use a pulse rifle to destroy everything in their 
path. Vines and jump pads can be used to reach higher platforms. Regardless of what suit the player 
is wearing, it will change back to blue if they take enough hits. At the end of each cavern is a boss

Captain America and the Doom Tube (1247) (c) 1987 Adventuresoft UK Ltd. / GO!|U.S. Gold Ltd. 
 
Your task is to infiltrate Megalomann's desert headquarters, the Doom Tube. This consists of three 
cylinders, one inside the other, each divided into several decks (levels) which are subdivided into 
quadrants (rooms). They are interconnected by an elevator, the Orbivator. 
The virus has, however, leaked into some of the rooms - some are more poisonous than others - and 
through the Captain has been injected with a protective serum, if a quadrant is too toxic it will 
kill him. The serum that keeps him alive is only temporarily effective but the ingredients to make 
more can be produced in the Converter quadrant. 
The Converter is activated by touching certain wall panels and placing sufficient quantities of Ying 
and Yang (the ingredients) in receiver plates. Ying and Yang can be obtained by blasting a doom pod 
found in one of the quadrants. 
You carry a nearly indestructible shield to deflect projectiles and nearly all energy beams. In some 
rooms, however, rotators are active and send out lethal beams. On destruction these rotators release 
a codeword which can be helpful in accessing later areas of the Doom Tube. 
If you can reach the final deck of the Doom Tube, you may be able to disarm the missile - but the 
game is played in real time, and you are given just one hour to save the world.

Captain Power and the Soldiers of the Future is a 2D space shooter. 
 
Based on the '87 TV series Captain Power and the Soldiers of the Future, this computer game of the 
same name sends you into the year 2147. Earth is a wasteland, and the evil Lord Dread rules with an 
iron hand. Only a small group of high-tech soldiers under the command of the charismatic Captain 
Power battles the nemesis and his band of Bio Dread henchmen. 
 
None of this matters in the game though. Instead, you launch into two space shooter sequences. Part 
one, the training mission, has you destroy three Dread drones in a cockpit-view shooting range. Part 
2, the Attack on Volcania, is a 2D sidescroller in which you eliminate approaching enemy spaceships. 
If enough hostiles have died, you get to bomb the enemy lair. The ship-shooting / hideout-bombing 
sequences are repeated until the fortresses shields are finally down. 
 
You will find more information about the Captain Power TV series in the trivia and links sections.

decrease of your lives. Dropping the part over the werewolf means his death and rebirth of another 
werewolf to kill you. To stop the werewolf you may set the dummy (blocker), which quantity is

Based on a popular television show at the time it was released, Card Sharks is a question and answer 
guessing game in which you compete against a computer player or another "live person". 
 
Questions are asked based upon a poll of 100 people. You must guess how many out of 100 answered Yes 
or No.  Your opponent then has the chance to guess whether the true answer is higher or lower than 
your answer.  If you are right, you are taken to the "Cards" screen to play a video version of the 
"High Low" card game. Guessing correctly lets you keep control of the board, and the next question.  
If you lose, your opponent receives the next question.  If you win enough times, you'll go to the 
"Big Bucks" card screen where you can bet all or part of your winnings on a more elaborate board of 
"High Low".

Carrier Command (1276) (c) 1989 Realtime Games Software Ltd. / Rainbird Software 
 
Carrier Command was one of the first real-time strategy games. 
 
You control an advanced cybernetic aircraft carrier complete with fighters, amphibious assault 
vehicles, laser defenses and a fleet of decoy drones.  Your mission is to build a series of resource, 
factory, and defensive bases spanning an island chain.  The only problem?  At the other end of the 
chain is an even more advanced carrier under control of a terrorist organization with the same 
mission. 
 
As you move around the islands you must decide what facilities to build and where they will best 
support your advance.  Resource islands provide materials that factory islands can use to build 
weapons and vehicles to replace your combat losses but both will be quickly overrun if the enemy 
attacks them while you are not present.  You also have to ensure that your stockpiles of equipment 
are stored safely until you can find time to launch a resupply drone to bring them to your carrier. 
 
From your carrier, you can take first person control of your attack aircraft and amphibious tanks and 
use them to assault enemy islands or even the enemy carrier itself if you're lucky enough to find it. 
 The weapon payloads on your vehicles are completely configurable based on your needs.  An island 
invasion may require launching a virus bomb that will take over the enemy command systems or just 
blasting the base with a wire guided surface to surface missile. 
 
Ultimately, you have to find and destroy the enemy carrier but, doing so will require a solid supply 
infrastructure and a strategy for depriving your opponent of his.

Carrier Force is an operational level game featuring combat between American and Japanese forces in 
1942. The game was later updated as Carrier Strike. There are 4 scenarios covered in this game, 
Midway, Coral Sea, The Battle of the Eastern Solomons and The Battle of the Santa Cruz Islands. Every 
major warship and plane is accounted for and accurately detailed.

while you give the orders and plot strategy. The game can be played by up to two people or in 
solitaire where the computer plays the Japanese. At the end of the game victory points are determined 
and the Japanese points are subtracted from the US points and compared to a table to determine the 
victory level. The game is advanced level and the playing time is 3 to 10 hours.

Case of the Mad Mummy, The (1280) (c) 1984 Gameworx Software / Softgold Int. Ltd. 
 
Famed sleuth Basil Byron has been asked to investigate the recent strange behavior of British 
adventurer Lord Munroe, who has disappeared from public life two years ago after returning from an 
expedition to Egypt. At that time, he shunned reporters and quickly fled the docks in a private 
coach, bringing with him a large cargo of crates, sea chests, and artifacts. Rumors suggest that he 
fled to his country estate in the west. Basil must search Castle Kreep where he resided, searching 
for clues regarding Munroe's behavior, as to his whereabouts. 
 
The Case of the Mad Mummy is a graphic adventure game where the player has to enter one- or two-word 
commands at the prompt. Some of the commands recognized by the game include LOOK, GET, READ, DROP, 
and GO, and directions can be abbreviated (eg: N/S/E/W). The player can find out what exits are 
visible, and what objects they are carrying.

basketball, motor racing and bowls amongst others included. There's also a strategic Star Trek game, 
Pinball, and Tanks, and Motorway is perhaps the first game in which running over pedestrians is the 
objective.

Castle Master (1289) (c) 1990 Incentive Software Ltd. / Domark Software, Inc. 
 
Castle Master is the fourth and final individual game to use the Freescape first-person solid 3D game 
system (after Driller, Dark Side and Total Eclipse). As a Prince or Princess armed with a slingshot, 
you have to explore a medieval castle to free your beloved from the evil Magister. 
 
Gameplay combines action and puzzle-solving, across four primary towers with three levels each. Doors 
must be opened using one of the ten included keys. These are unmarked, as are the various potions - 
making it a challenge to know which keys open which doors, and which potions are beneficial. 
 
Contact with ghouls drains your energy, as does falling too far (there are narrow pathways to 
negotiate), while eating cheese can replenish this. Movement and aiming are controlled separately.

able to jump and crack his whip directly in front of him. Power-ups can be obtained by defeating 
enemies or by whipping candles that appear in the castle. One such power-up increases the power and 
length of Simon's whip.  Different weapons can be gathered which consume hearts when used, these 
hearts can also be collected from monsters and candles. Additionally, some walls will hide secrets 
such as the health-restorative turkey or the Double and Triple shot abilities for the weapons Simon 
has collected. At the end of each section of the castle is a boss, which must be defeated. 
Progression through the castle eventually leads to a confrontation with Count Dracula himself.

Cauldron (1323) (c) 1985 Palace Software, LTD. / Palace Software, LTD. 
 
Playing a witch, you must assemble the six ingredients required to kill off your arch-rival, an evil 
pumpkin. The ingredients are all located in underground buildings, each of which can only be entered 
once you've found the appropriate key. The keys are located overground, and you must fly around on 
your broom to collect them. 
 
The overground sections play like standard shoot 'em ups, as your broom is not affected by gravity 
and can fire bullets using your magic energy. Bats, fireballs and even seagulls are among the many 
creatures trying to stop you - contact will cost you more energy than shooting at them would. There 
are energy recharges on offer. 
 
Once you go underground, the gameplay becomes a test of precision platform jumping, including some 
Manic Miner-esque blind jumps. The six underground sections can be completed in a variety of orders, 
but you will sometimes reach points that cna't be completed without objects from other sections, so a 
lot of back-tracking is required. Although you start with nine lives, they won't last all that long 
at first.

Cauldron II - The Pumpkin Strikes Back (1324) (c) 1986 RamJam Corporation, The / Palace Software, 
LTD. 
 
An evil witch has brought evil and darkness to the enchanted wood, wiping out all but 1 of the 
innocent pumpkins. As the poem in the instructions sheet explains, the only way to put things right 
is to capture a lock of her hair, then take it to the cauldron and cast a spell to undo things. 
 
Controlling the pumpkin is difficult at first, as it has a very high bounce, the exact level of which 
can be toggled using the 5 key. Direction can only be changed when the ball is on the ground. 
Ricocheting into enemies costs energy, and you only gain weaponry by landing into magic pools. The 
starting positions are random,  making mapping advisable and increasing the initial challenge. 
 
Even then, enemies respawn quickly, so all you're doing is buying a little time to pass them. Others 
can't be shot, and must be passed by possessing the right object - possibly one of the 5 you will 
ultimately need to vanquish the witch.

Abraham Lincoln's hat, the Loch Ness Monster's egg, and a piece of flint. 
 
When entering the cave, you can choose 3 options: up or down which take you to one of the 4 time 
periods, or go to the Time Grouches' lair where they will attack you two at a time. Using your sword 
you swing at them until you connect when their guard is down.  If you defeat enough of them, you will 
get one of the required items behind 4 doors. 
 
When you go to each time period, you will have to correctly choose the proper actions in order to 
solve the required puzzle.  You may have to go through each several times until you are able to get

Centipede (1364) (c) 1983 Atari, Inc. / Atarisoft 
 
In Centipede, the player is trapped in the Enchanted Forest. Armed with only a magic wand to ward off 
the forest's insect denizens, all of which apparently are attacking in the player in continuous 
waves. 
 
The player must use the magic wand to shoot sparks at approaching insects to score points by pressing 
the controller button. Holding down the controller button will set the wand to rapid fire shots. If 
the player is bitten by an insect, the player will be temporarily paralyzed and lose one of the three 
starting magic wands. 
 
Insect Opponents and Mushrooms 
All enemy insects have a distinctive sound before attacking, which may help the player identify which 
insect is attacking. Enemies and objects in the game are as the following: 
 
1. The Centipede 
The Centipede will attack in 12 waves. In the first wave, the Centipede will have a head attached to 
11 body segments. In the second wave, the Centipede will have a head attached to 10 body segments, in 
addition to a detached head. The third wave will have the Centipede with an attached head, 9 body 
segments, plus two detached heads. These body segments will transform into heads and continue to do 
so until Wave 12. In the last wave, the Centipede will have 12 detached heads, independently 
attacking the player. Centipede heads are worth more points than body segments. 
 
Attacks from the Centipede will come from the top of the screen, moving downward. If a spark hits any 
part of the Centipede, that particular body segment will transform into a mushroom, while the body 
segment behind it will become the new Centipede head. When the Centipede is destroyed, it will 
briefly disappear and re-appear from the top of the screen again. 
 
The Spider 
The Spider will attempt to distract the player from attacking the Centipede. It will destroy any 
mushroom it touches. Spiders will score more points if it is hit in closer distances. 
 
The Flea 
The Flea will appear if the player has destroyed most of the existing mushrooms. It will drop down 
creating a new batch of mushrooms where it falls. The Flea will disappear after two hits. After the 
first hit, the Flea will drop down much faster. 
 
The Scorpion 
The Scorpion will appear in the third wave. It moves slowly but will pick up speed, moving faster. 
While doing so, it will poison any mushroom it touches.

effects to enemy insects. It takes for shots to complete destroy a mushroom. There are two type of 
mushrooms: Magic Mushrooms and Poisonous mushrooms. Magic mushrooms are the default mushrooms in the 
game and are also the the result of the player destroying an insect or Centipede body segment. 
Poisonous Mushrooms are the result of the Scorpion touching a mushroom. Poisonous Mushrooms will 
prompt the Centipede near it to move straight towards the player through any mushroom. Losing a wand 
will restore any partially damaged mushroom.

C'est La Vie (1211) (c) 1983 Eastman Computing / Adventure International 
 
Jacques needs to gather ten, twenty, and fifty dollar bills scattered around the streets of New York 
before time runs out. He must also be on the lookout for muggers and tax collectors that prowl the 
streets in search of victims. If one of them catches Jacques, they will pursue him relentlessly until 
he is caught. Once Jacques is caught, a tax collector will steal 50% of his earnings, and a mugger 
will steal all of it. Crashing into walls will cause Jacques to end up in hospital for treatment and 
get slapped with a $200 bill. 
 
After he makes enough money, he can deposit his cash safely into the bank. Alternatively, Jacques can 
buy or sell shares at Wall Street, but how much stock he gets depends on the current state of the 
stock market. If Jacques runs out of money, he can get a loan of up to $10,000, and he is given two 
months to pay back the loan. If Jacques fails to pay back the loan within two months, then Ed will 
send one of his goons to seek Jacques out and relieve him of his cash, as well as put him in 
hospital. 
 
The idea is for Jacques to get as rich as he can

Chain Reaction (1374) (c) 1987 Durell Software Ltd. / Durell Software Ltd. 
 
The Anti-Nuclear Party are up to their old tricks again. They have decided to infiltrate a nuclear 
power station and programmed the robots to empty the containment vault and attack all scientists 
inside it. To make matters worse, the entire facility will self-destruct in fifty minutes. 
 
As one of the scientists that survived the onslaught, the player must prevent this from happening by 
collecting eighteen fuel canisters scattered around all seven floors of the facility and disposing of 
them in the pit that lies at the center of the first floor, but only one canister can be carried at a 
time. 
 
If the player comes into contact with any of the robots, their radiation level increases. Once the 
player becomes totally contaminated, they will die. There are decontamination showers around the 
facility, and entering them reduces their radiation level. 
 
Players are also equipped with a jet-pack that can be used to fly over dangerous areas.

Champions of Krynn (1383) (c) 1990 Strategic Simulations, Inc. / Strategic Simulations, Inc. 
 
The War of the Lance is over, the dragonarmies have been defeated. But evil has not left Krynn. In 
northeastern Ansalon, outposts of the Knights of Solamnia remain to guard the fragile peace. Your 
party of adventurers is hired to carry out missions for the Knights. On your first mission, you 
stumble upon Draconians, long believed to have left the area. What are their plans? On your travels 
you have to face dangers in many dungeons and towns and might even meet some of the legendary Heroes 
of the Lance. 
 
Champions of Krynn is the first of SSI's "gold box" games set in the AD&D world of Dragonlance, with 
all the usual features: first-person view and movement in dungeons, towns and outposts, overland 
travel on a map of the area and tactical turn-based combat from a top-down perspective. 
 
As the first game set in Krynn, it has several features unique to that setting: In character races, 
one can choose from Kender, Silvanesti or Qualinesti Elves and Mountain or Hill Dwarves in addition 
to humans and half-elves. Special character classes include Solamnic Knights, clerics of the major 
deities of Krynn and mages of either the Red or the White Robe. The deities grant special spells and 
powers to their respective clerics. Red and White mages have access to different spells and the 
phases of the moons of Krynn affect their spellcasting abilities.

Chase HQ (1407) (c) 1989 Taito Corporation / Ocean Software Ltd. 
 
As an undercover agent of Chase Headquarters, your job is to patrol the streets and track down five 
criminals. You are given a mission briefing before you start which gives information on the suspect 
and what car they drive. Then you drive across the city without crashing into other cars, and catch 
up with the criminal's car. To arrest the suspects, you must keep bumping into their car until it is 
no longer functional. And you have to do this under a strict time limit. You can't afford to crash 
into cars or buildings or you waste time getting on the road again. 
 
However, once you've caught up with your suspect, you are given more time. Your car is also equipped 
with turbo boosts, which you can use to gain extra speed if you are way behind the criminal. Each 
arrest is based on a "suspicion".

SCI - Special Criminal Investigation (1408) (c) 1990 Taito Corporation / Ocean Software Ltd. 
 
Three girls have been reported missing including the mayor's daughter, and Chase Special 
Investigations has asked you to track down five vehicles, mentioned in the mission briefing, who are 
believed to be involved in the kidnapping. Using a heavy-designed machine with a V6 DOHC 3000CC Twin 
Turbo Engine, five sets of nitro-fuel boosts, and a gun attached to the steering wheel (which you can 
use to damage the target vehicle), your mission is to patrol the streets and find these vehicles. 
 
The gameplay is similar to Chase H.Q., but there are a few differences. For example, cars travel in 
both directions instead of one, and some of them will catch up to your car and shoot at you. At least 
once in every stage a helicopter does a fly by and drops you some grenades you can use to further 
damage the target vehicle. A guy on a motorcycle will catch up to you and throw grenades at your car. 
And, most importantly, as mentioned earlier, you can shoot at the target vehicle rather than just 
bumping into it. 
 
Have fun driving around, but remember, there is a strict time limit, so I wouldn't waste time or keep 
crashing into things if I were you.

Chicken Chase (1440) (c) 1985 Jawx / Firebird Software Ltd. 
 
Players control a cock who is making sure that his wife delivers at least one of her children into 
the world. The cock automatically goes into the back room to mate with his wife, who lays an egg 
shortly afterwards. After this, it is up to the player to make sure that there is at least one egg 
among the two rows of nests, and that the egg is not destroyed by snakes, rats, raccoons, porcupines, 
and the like that are smart enough to climb the ladders leading up to the nests. 
 
The creatures enter the henhouse from either side, and must be moved along by pecking at them. As the 
cock walks around the henhouse, its energy will decrease. It must be replenished by eating chicken 
feed at both sides of the henhouse. Only then will the cock move faster. 
 
Upon entering the back room, the player must wait until one or more hearts appear at the top of the 
screen, as they indicate the number of eggs the mother will lay. Since there are ten nests, up to ten 
hearts can only appear at a give time. 
 
When an egg sits in the nest long enough, a egg will hatch out, and the resulting chick will make its 
way toward the back room, ring the bell outside the door, then go on in. If one of the creatures 
destroy an egg, or the only egg in the nest hatches out, the player loses a life, and the game is 
over when all lives are lost.

Watch out for the robot guards who shoot at you - try to find weaponry of your own. Only a small area 
of Cholo is inhabitable, so listen out for Geiger Counter clicks as you get close to the wasteland 
areas - these will weaken your droid. A map is provided, which also indicates where the teleporters

Choplifter (1459) (c) 1982 Brøderbund Software, Inc. / Brøderbund Software, Inc. 
 
Choplifter is a side-scrolling action/arcade game that puts you in command of an attack chopper.  
Your mission: Go behind enemy lines and rescue up to 16 hostages per level.  Be careful, though, 
because tanks and enemy aircraft will try to stop you -- and they won't stop shooting while you are 
rescuing those hostages! 
 
Originally released for Apple II home computers, Choplifter was later ported to the arcades and a 
number of video game consoles.  Many imitators and homages would follow.

Chopper Hunt (1464) (c) 1984 A.N.A.L.O.G. Software / Imagic 
 
This is a redoing of A.N.A.L.O.G. Software's Buried Buck$, with some changes. 
 
You are still a helicopter but now the treasure you are after looks different for each level. For 
example, level one you are after barrels of oil, level two is green money bags, level three is 
nuclear symbols (uranium, I suppose), etc. You must still bomb the ground to dig a hole to reach the 
treasures and the plane is still dropping giant clods of dirt to fill in the hole, and maybe bury 
you. When you gather a treasure, you must still land on your base to claim it. If you are destroyed 
before you return to base, you drop the treasure. You can only carry one treasure at a time. After 
you collect all the buried treasures, you move on to the next level. 
 
There background has also been spruced up. There are mountains, a cloud and a sun. The plane has been 
altered from a bomber to a fighter jet. Chopper Hunt, unlike Buried Buck$, was also ported to the 
Commodore 64.

Chuckie Egg (1474) (c) 1984 A&F&nbsp / A&F&nbsp 
 
In the game you play Hen House Harry who has to collect 12 (a dozen) eggs from each level, while 
avoiding the ducklings.  The levels each occupy a single screen, and are made up of platforms, 
ladders and lifts (or elevators), and are thus similar to those in classic platform game Donkey Kong. 
 Corn can also be collected, which stops the time limit from ticking down and also stops the bonus, 
collected when the level is completed, from decreasing.  The ducklings also eat the corn, however. 
 
There are only 8 distinct levels.  The ninth level is a copy of level 1, the tenth is a copy of level 
2, and so on.  However, on the second time around the ducklings that can use the platforms and 
ladders are replaced by the Mother Duck, who can fly around the level going through the platforms and 
ladders.  On the third time around, you have to face both the Mother Duck and the ducklings, and 
similarly on subsequent goes round, when there are more ducklings.

Chuckie Egg II (1475) (c) 1985 A&F&nbsp / A&F&nbsp 
 
Chuckie Egg II is a sequel to platformer game Chuckie Egg, but is very different from the original 
game.  Whereas the original game features eight levels of one screen each, this features many more 
screens arranged into a maze for you to explore. 
 
In the game, Hen House Harry must build a giant chocolate egg, with the ingredients (cocoa, milk and 
sugar), that are found in the factory.  Eight of each must be included.  Also, the eight parts of a 
toy kit must be found, to place inside the egg. 
 
In order to get all the items you must find your way around the factory, avoiding many types of 
enemy, and solving puzzles using various items that you can carry.  There are a number of ways to get 
around the factory, including the platforms of the original, but also ropes and pipes, among other 
things. 
 
Despite the drastic changes from the original, the game still retains the sound effects from the 
original.

road you come upon what appears to be a Circus tent, nestled in a small valley.  Sounds and music 
come from inside.  As you reach the gate, suddenly there is complete silence.  You walk fearfully 
towards the entrance of the tent, wondering what exactly is going on here.  Maybe if you are lucky, 
you can find some gas here... 
 
Around this time, the game engine was replaced with a far more powerful one.  Now the games accepted 
complete sentences.  You can hit ENTER to switch between graphics and all text.  This made them 
somewhat easier to play and less frustrating.

Stunt #1: You and the lion must jump through several rings of fire. Remember to avoid the jugs that 
emit fire. You must do this for 100 meters. 
 
Stunt #2: Walk the tightrope for 70 meters, avoiding the monkeys that get in your way. Jump the cyan 
monkeys for 500 points. 
 
Stunt #3: Roll on a ball for 80 meters, jumping from ball to ball. You can move balls backwards if 
the target is too close to make a successful jump. Avoid contact with the ground. 
 
Stunt #4: Ride a horse for 200 meters, bouncing on trampolines along the way. Be careful not to miss 
the jump or go over the tops of trampolines. You can speed up or slow down the horse. 
 
Stunt #5: Finally, trapeze from swing to swing for 50 meters. If you miss, make sure that you land on 
the platforms below so you bounce back on a swing. 
 
Once you have completed all five stunts, you have to do them again and hopefully, more points will be 
awarded.

Citadel (1495) (c) 1989 Electric Dreams Software / Electric Dreams Software 
 
Citadel is a comparatively slow-paced shooter that emphasizes planning and careful movement over fast 
reflexes. 
 
On a planet that was thought to be uninhabited, an underground city complex has been discovered. The 
player's task is to explore this city with a remote-controlled hoverdrone, called Monitor, while 
trying to avoid its automatic defense systems. 
 
Monitor is controlled from a top-down perspective and can only be moved into four directions, holding 
down the fire-button enables it to shoot in eight directions. There are various stationary and moving 
enemies that activate when Monitor gets close enough and start shooting when it moves. Some can shoot 
in four, others in eight directions, while others only try to ram the monitor or attack with homing 
shots. 
 
Pressing the fire-button twice and then holding it activates a capture probe that can be used to pick 
up items, operate switches and control hostile drones. Drones under Monitor's control follow it 
around and can be used as a shield against projectiles, a battering ram against other drones or a 
plug to prevent more enemies from emerging from a trap. Captured movable drones automatically move 
into the direction Monitor is firing in, but can also be locked in a relative position by pressing 
the space bar. In order to be able to capture a drone, a certain amount of energy is needed, 
depending on the type of the drone. Items to replenish energy can be picked up as well as better 
weapons like rapid-fire or two- or three-way fire. 
 
There are eight cities to explore, each consisting of two floors connected via lift shafts. Usually, 
reaching the exit of a city involves going back and forth between both floors and deactivating 
various beam generators that block the path.

prior knowledge of the layouts is essential to get through most sections of the five levels without 
losing lives. The two-player mode involves the screen following the lead player, so the latter can

Classic Concentration (1510) (c) 1988 Softie, Inc. / ShareData, Inc. 
 
Concentration was a popular game show in the mid-to-late 1980s, and this game was adapted from that 
television program. 
 
Two players can play against each other, or one person can play against a computer generated 
opponent. The answer to the puzzle is hidden by tiles. The tiles have words denoting game prizes 
("Mexico", "Camera", "Telescope", for example), and your object is to find the two matching worded 
tiles. Exposing two at a time, your memory is taxed as more prize tiles are revealed and then covered 
over again.  As more tiles are matched, the hidden puzzle is revealed. Solve the puzzle and you win 
the game.

"WANTED: El Bandito Dead or Alive." Basically you are the super hero trying to kill this bandit. In 
order to do this, you are given tools like an anvil, a boulder, a bomb, a boomerang, or a cannon. You 
basically are trying to crush him to go on. This game takes place as if you are acting the entire act 
out. It is very similar to the road runner and the coyote, the graphics are also very identical.

like Donkey Kong 
 
You begin in the bottom right or bottom center and must make your way, via ladders, to the top left 
to retrieve a ball. Avoid moving obstacles however you can. Be careful you do not touch an obstacle 
or you will lose a life and be returned to your starting point. When you get the ball, you move on to

Cloud Kingdoms (1526) (c) 1990 Electralyte / Logotron Entertainment 
 
Baron von Bansai has stolen Terry's precious collection of crystals, and dropped them onto 32 
different kingdoms, so Terry sets off to retrieve them. Viewed from above, his challenge sees him 
having to progress through these worlds, collecting keys to gain access to different sections, and 
avoiding enemy balls and bugs by jumping them where possible. There are no 'lives' as such, but 
there's a strict time limit of around 400 seconds for the whole game, and death puts you back to the 
start of the level, with time lost as well. You get an extra 80 seconds for completing each level 
though. 
 
The levels feature all manner of further hazards - there are holes in the ground to avoid falling 
through (some visible, some hidden), arrows which force the ball in a particular direction, slippery 
squares making any movement's effect exaggerated, magneted squares making it impossible to jump from, 
and many more. Fortunately lots of power-ups, time boosts and bonus fruits are dropped onto the 
levels at random intervals as well. 
 
To complete the game you must clear 8 levels, and the structure is non-linear - initially you have a 
choice of 4 levels, and after completing one of those you have a choice of 4 more levels (which are 
different depending on which level you completed first). The third and fourth levels you take on as 
you go through the game are chosen from a choice of 3, the fifth and sixth from a choice of two, and 
only those final two levels are perscribed (although they do vary depending on which levels you've 
already done). 
 
Each of the 32 worlds has its own twist - Arrow Kingdom has a large amount of arrows directing you, 
Ice Kingdom is especially slippery, Unseen Kingdom leaves you to work out the route for yourself 
(other than the holes, which are all you can see), Box Kingdom involves a lot of flying over some 
trapped squares to grab the keys they contain before making the main jumps onto the sections which 
contain crystals, and so on.

Clowns (1529) (c) 1983 Bally Midway Manufacturing Co., Inc. / Commodore Electronics Ltd. 
 
Clowns is a home computer port of the arcade game with the same name released by Bally/Midway in 
1978. Gameplay share some similarities with Breakout, but this time the bricks has been replaced with 
balloons that  you get points for popping. To reach the balloons at the top of the screen you have to 
move a seesaw under a jumping clown. This will launch away the clown already standing on the seesaw, 
hopefully towards the balloons. 
 
Balloons comes in three different: yellow, green and blue. Yellow balloons are the easiest to reach, 
while the blue are the hardest. Therefore you also get more points for the harder to reach balloons.  
If you manage to clear all balloons of a color, you'll get bonus points. Balloons of that color will 
then be replenished.  You have five jumpers to your disposal, and you will lose one everytime you 
miss to catch the landing clown. Clearing all blue balloons will give you an extra jumper. 
 
Clowns can be played by one or two players using paddles.

Stallone's Cobra character you must rescue Ingrid Knutsen before the Night Slasher gets to her. There 
are 3 levels of gameplay, set in a city, the countryside and a factory. All have multiple ledges and 
platforms to negotiate. 
 
Cobra starts without a weapon, but he is tough enough to attack with a precisely timed head-butt, 
although this method of killing is risky, as it will kill Cobra if mistimed. Fortunately there are 
weapons to pick up along the way, by picking up hamburgers. The weapons include daggers, pistols and 
machine guns, but all are time-limited

The star of Thing on a Spring returns in this sequel. The evil Toy Goblin is up to his old tricks, 
with his giant toy factory producing thousands of evil toys. In order to shut down the factory, Thing 
must travel through the factory's 11 different levels and  collect the tape, floppy disk, listing 
paper and ROM chip scattered throughout. 
 
The levels are filled with slopes, conveyor belts, interconnected pipework (years before Sonic the 
Hedgehog), and lots of foes to avoid. Question mark times have variable effects: stepping onto them 
reveals bonus points, objects, or a large weight that squashes Thing flat. 
 
As Thing takes damage from enemies or weights, his oil level is reduced. When Thing runs out of oil, 
he becomes rusted and the game ends. To move between levels, Thing must enter the pipework through a 
vent and bounce around the pipes to find an exit.

Collapse (1557) (c) 1985 
 
Collapse is a simple puzzle game where players control Zen the Mole who is presented with a network 
of sticks that he must turn blue. Zen does this by simply walking over them while he is yellow. To 
get to the network, he must turn himself red so that he can build bridges that lead to it. Zen's 
redness disappears after a few seconds and he turns back to his default state. Once Zen has managed 
to turn the sticks blue, he can unleash the Rotox, a white line that moves around adjacent blue 
sticks, destroying them once the Rotox makes contact. When all the sticks have been destroyed, Zen 
proceeds to the next screen. 
 
The blue sticks must be destroyed within a time limit. While the player navigates Zen around the 
screen, two creatures walk around the screen, trying to make Zen's task difficult. Contact with 
either of these creatures result in Zen losing 100 units of time. To deal with them, Zen is equipped 
with some magic dust that he can sprinkle on them to make them disappear and resurrect in their same 
position that they appear. Extra time is awarded to Zen by collecting jewels that occasionally appear 
on screen.

Colony (1565) (c) 1987 Icon Design Ltd. / Mastertronic Ltd. 
 
Mankind has established a distant colony, but the area is infested with ants, ladybirds and other 
parasites, all ready to cut through the perimeter fencing and eat your people's food. As a service 
droid it is your job to prevent this, and maximise the output. 
 
Achieving this involves a lot of planning and resource management. There are several buildings at 
your disposal, containing seeds, solar panels, weaponry, fencing and traps. You must plant the seeds, 
use the solar panels to maximise their growth, and then harvest the finished product so as to trade 
it. You can carry a gun to take care of the bugs, but this needs recharging frequently, and the 
location of the munitions store must be determined. 
 
When the bugs break part of the fence, you need to replace it to stop lots more coming through. This 
can be done more quickly by reducing the compound size, which causes the trade-off loss of growing 
room.

North, South, East and West, directions in Discworld are Hubward, Rimward, Widdershins, and Turnwise. 
 
Players control Rincewind the Wizzard, the fastest Wizzard in Discworld, who understands the finer 
points of survival (like it's not where you are running to, it's what you are running from).  In his 
adventure, based on book of the same name, he meets Discworld notables like Twoflower the Tourist, 
Luggage the luggage, and Death while saving Ankh-Morpork (again).

Comet Game, The (1600) (c) 1986 
 
Aimed to tie in with Halley's Comet passing close to Earth, but actually missing the boat by some 
time, The Comet Game is based on the idea of Halley's comet coming with bacterial life-forms capable 
of destroying life on earth. As a result, you must get into your high-tech spaceship, intercept the 
comet, and destroy those organisms. Controlling the ship's autopilot technology, you must ensure that 
the task is successfully completed. 
 
You must ensure that missile attacks on the ship are unsuccessful (by shooting at the missiles before 
they hit a your ship, a la Missile Command, controlling a cross-hair that moves around the ship), and 
maintain communication with Earth, by aiming the comms beam in the right direction to get the best 
signal. 
 
Keeping the computer running smoothly requires moving a line of LEDs to match what is being 
displayed. The fourth ongoing task is to keep the ship's crew happy. This is done in a rather surreal 
way, by brewing coffee and injecting it into the crew (who are in suspended animation).

rifle and a few grenades you must take on hordes of Nazis. Some are wandering around in the open, 
while others have picked out hiding places, which you must approach from certain angles. Trees, 
rivers and bridges create a varied combat-like terrain and must be incorporated into your thinking. 
Extra grenades can be collected, and will definitely be required, as they allow you to kill form 
distance and thus avoid some enemy shots.

Computer Scrabble (1622) (c) 1984 Psion Software Ltd. / Leisure Genius 
 
Computer Scrabble is the earliest official computer version of the popular word game. The game has an 
11000-word dictionary containing the most frequently-used words in Scrabble. As a result, some very 
obscure words (mostly of 2 and 3 letters - keen Scrabble players will know that these are often the 
most profitable scoring method) are included, but common words such as 'bigot' and 'sheen' are 
queried by the game - simply tell it that your move is a word and it will move on trustingly. 
 
Inputting words is done by moving the cursor across or down to the starting position of the word, and 
then pressing to key the word in, pressing space before the letter you wish to use a blank tile as. 
All words formed are accurately scored. The game can juggle your tiles and allow you to manually 
rearrange them, and you can watch the computer 'think' as it notices possible moves and their 
scoring. There are four difficulty levels, with the highest capable of combined scores over 700.

Conflict in Vietnam (1633) (c) 1986 MicroProse Software, Inc. / MicroProse Software, Inc. 
 
The third and final installment in Microprose's Command series of war games simulates five key 
battles in Vietnam, beginning with the defeat of the French colonial army in 1954 and culminating in 
the 1972 victory of the Viet Cong against South Vietnam forces. 
 
Conflict in Vietnam adapts the well tried "accelerated real-time" game system of its predecessors to 
the jungle combat situation in Indochina, with its bizarre balance of power, specific technology 
(such massive use of helicopters) and unique strategic challenges. Impressively complex for its time, 
the simulation calculates a day-night-cycle, weather, terrain, supply lines, formations, unit 
organization and experience, to name only the most important factors. Two players can compete head to 
head on one computer, soloists may randomize the enemy priorities in some scenarios for added 
uncertainty on the battlefield. 
 
Even more so than in the previous games, designer duo Sid Meier and Ed Bever stress the educational 
aspect of their well-researched historical simulation: the manual is desgined as a complementary read 
that offers extensive background information to the five scenarios and their 'what if' variants.

This is a puzzle game where you must explode all of the bombs on each level, using a spark.  The 
spark flows along a fuse, which is made up of a series of tiles.  These can be moved, in the manner 
of sliding puzzles, where there is only one gap, and tiles can be moved into the gap, creating a new 
gap.  The aim is then to move the tiles so the fuse forms a path from the spark to each bomb. 
 
There is a time limit, however, and extra time is knocked off if the spark reaches a dead end.  Also 
some levels contain water droplets, that extinguish the spark if they touch it.

finishing position to qualify. 
 
The car has high and low gears, and is susceptible to damage from contact with another car. Once you 
hit a car or a piece of the trackside scenery you will be called into the pits - fail to make it

Cool Croc Twins (1662) (c) 1992 Empire Software / Empire Software 
 
Cool Croc Twins is a platform game where, as one of the cool crocodile twins Punk and Funk, you try 
to reach the beautiful crocodile girl. 
 
To do so, you'll have to complete over 60 levels. Each level is made of a bunch of thin, floating 
platforms. When you approach the edge of a platform, you do not fall off - rather, you begin walking 
upside-down on the other side! Instead of jumping, you "reverse the gravity" of your croc, causing 
him to fall up or down until he lands on a platform. 
 
You goal on each level is to light up all the bulbs by bumping them with your head. If you hit the 
bulb three times it will be completely lit up. Some bulbs are invisible on higher levels. There are 
also foes who want to stop you and who sabotage your efforts by bumping into the bulbs you've lit, 
turning them off. Your foes can walk on both sides of the platforms just as you and can jump from 
platform to platform just as you, so watch out! 
 
The game can be played by 2 players, so if you are Funk then your friend is Punk and you can 
challenge each other in scores.

In Countdown to Shutdown you control eight droids on the mission to find the core room of an nuclear

The game is an arcade-like 3D adventure, you see always only the room your droid moves in, in the 
bottom of the screen you receive information like actual core temp and radiation level, time 
remaining, the direction you heading for, information about your shield level and others . Once you 
found the core room you must attempt to damp down the reactor temperature to avoid a major 
catastrophe a second explosion will cause. 
With the joystick you control all 8 droids, you have to switch several times between them because of 
the fact, that each of them has a special ability (like scientific, medical, technical, combat, 
intelligence, power, strength and mobility). Over 2.000 rooms on 8 levels waiting for you. Examine 
all rooms (press "E" on your keyboard) for useful and often required items and valuables (like 
weapons, medical or technical tool sets) - each of your droids is able to keep 8 items in his 
inventory. Beware of radiation (the closer you get to the core room, the more it increases, before 
entering the core room you need to find and activate radiation shields), defense droids  which were 
installed to keep out intruders (like you!) and Plasma. Because of the first explosion some doors 
between rooms were blocked or damaged: Find the needed technical tool sets for example to fix such 
issues. 
Once you have found the core room, use the abilities of your different droids and the - hopefully 
found - correct tools to damp down the temperature and stop the disaster.

Count, The (1710) (c) 1985 Adventure International / Commodore 
 
You awaken in a sealed wing of the Count's Transylvanian castle, seemingly restrictive but yielding 
further avenues of secret passages and unexpected exits to the intrepid and timely explorer.  Over 
the course of a few days you need to cultivate a familiarity with the layout of the castle and the 
nocturnal activities of its primary resident, who chooses to make midnight snacks of you rather than 
a main course.  An unpredictable day/night cycle forces your hand, necessitating finding a reliable 
light source and some means of staying awake -- or else you awaken the next morning back in bed, your 
possessions pilfered by the kleptomaniacal creature of the night and your neck boasting irritated 
bite marks.  Each day you must incrementally approach your goal of overcoming the Count, lest you 
wind up as one more dried-out apéritif.

Creatures II - Torture Trouble (1787) (c) 1992 Apex Computer Productions / Thalamus Ltd 
 
Creatures 2: Torture Trouble follows on from the events in Creatures. Clyde Radcliff, after 
eliminating the demons and saving his fellow Fuzzy Wuzzies in the previous game, has settled down 
with 'Fuzzette' Bonnie, and they have 9 children. Unfortunately, some demons had escaped and decide 
to take revenge by kidnapping their children and everyone else in their village. Clyde must rescue 
them all, and wipe out the demons. 
 
The game abandons the scrolling levels of the original, although it retains the torture chambers, 
where Clyde must manipulate the objects in the single screen level to save one or more of his family 
and friends. 
 
The various attack modes that Clyde has are now upgraded by picking up potions on the torture chamber 
levels, rather than getting them from the witch, as in the original. Also, bonus coins can be picked 
up on most levels, and collecting 5 of them earns an extra life. 
 
The game is made up of three islands. A Torture chamber level is followed by an interlude, where 
Fuzzy Wuzzies are thrown from a high ledge. Here Clyde and the Fuzzy he last rescued bounce the other 
Fuzzies to safety on another ledge, whilst avoiding bouncing a Fuzzy into the clutches of a flying 
demon. They must bounce a certain number of Fuzzies to safety in the time limit. 
 
After a further torture chamber level and accompanying interlude, Clyde is captured by a family of 3 
demons. He must destroy them in turn, by kicking bugs so they are sucked into the ACME vacuum 
machines, and fired at the demons, while avoiding what the demons are dropping on him. The demons are 
faced in order of increasing size and power. 
 
The final level on all but the third island involves Clyde transporting Fuzzies from this island to 
the next. Clyde has scuba gear, so can go underwater, but must carry the other Fuzzies over the top 
of the water, whilst avoiding various demons that might attack the Fuzzies or Clyde. There are 
islands in the middle that act as drop-off points.

Creatures (1786) (c) 1990 Apex Computer Productions / Thalamus Ltd 
 
The inhabitants of the pretty but insignificant planet Blot decided to leave to find a trendier 
planet, and escape being called the Blotians, a most unhip name.  Until they such a planet, they call 
themselves the Fuzzy Wuzzies. 
 
Their colony ship collides with an asteroid, and crash lands in the Pacific Ocean, near an 
unchartered island, which they colonise, calling it "The Hippest Place in The Known 
Universe".  Unfortunately the island is also home to rather nasty demons, who can't stand the 
commotion caused by the happy Fuzzies, or their silly name for the island. 
 
The demons kidnap the Fuzzy Wuzzies by hosting a massive party, then capturing them in a net, and 
dragging them off to the torture chambers.  The only Fuzzy not caught is Clyde Radcliff, who was 
already being sick in the bushes.  He wakes up in the morning with a really bad headache, and fiery 
halitosis, and sets out to destroy the demons, and rescue his friends. 
 
The game consists of 3 levels, each made up of 3 of stages.  The first two stages of each level are 
side scrolling platformers, where Clyde must destroy the enemies by firing at them, presumably using 
his halitosis.  At the end of each of these stages, Clyde meets a witch, who can provide him with 
extra firing patterns, or upgrade those he has, in exchange for 'magic potion creatures' found during 
the stages. 
 
The final stage on each level is a torture chamber, which takes place on a single screen.  Here Clyde 
must stop one of his friends being killed by the demons, who are using some sort of ACME device.  
This is a puzzle game stage, where you must use the items in the room to kill one of the demons 
threatening Clyde's friend.  Clues can also be bought from the witch.  Whatever the outcome, either 
death will be gory, although the cartoony graphics of the game means that things aren't really 
graphic.

Crime and Punishment is a courtroom simulation, where you play the judge. The emphasis lies on 
deciding the punishment, rather than if the person is guilty or not - that has already been decided. 
The aim is to receive as many Gavels as possible (out of ten), by choosing the same sentence as a 
judge. 
 
Cases range from perjury and theft right up to murder and rape. To help you make your decision, you 
can receive information about the crime. This includes the damage caused by the crime, the villain's 
background and personal circumstances, and his/her motive. 
 
Be aware that the more information you ask for, the less gavels you receive. The AI can sometimes 
produce surprising choices of sentences.

collaborated on Crusade's design, which (along with the game's manual) shows an enormous amount of 
research and attention to historical detail. 
 
As the title suggests, the game's focus is the European Theater of World War II in 1944-45, and the 
Normandy Invasion in particular.  Although there are only five scenarios, each can be customized 
through multiple variants (with different initial deployments and reinforcement schedules) and levels 
of difficulty.  Another nice feature is the ability to play using either tradtional boardgame symbols 
or unit icons.  Both sides (Allied and Axis) can be played, and two players can play head-to-head in 
hotseat mode.

of the heroes at the most inopportune times. They must now search for the source of the bonds, and 
free themselves from the curse. 
 
The second in the  Gold Box series of role-playing games, Curse of the Azure Bonds is a sequel to  
Pool of Radiance. The gameplay is nearly identical to that of the predecessor and other Gold Box 
games. Following the  AD&D rules of role-playing, the player creates a party of characters (up to the 
maximum of six). Two new character classes (Paladin and Ranger) are added to the four basic AD&amp

Cuthbert Goes Walkabout (11263) (c) 1984 MicroDeal / MicroDeal 
 
In this installment of the Cuthbert Saga, Cuthbert goes for a stroll on a grid. As he walks along all 
four sides of a cell in a grid, it changes color, and when all cells have been coloured, it is on to 
the next grid. This would have been too easy, were it not for the nasties that also walk along the 
grid. Cuthbert's only weapons are his wits and his ability to jump over the nasties. Just try not to 
jump out of the screen! The inspiration for this game is the old arcade game, Amidar, and it can be 
seen as a primitive version of Oh Mummy.

Cuthbert in Space (1880) (c) 1984 MicroDeal / MicroDeal 
 
Cuthbert, the versatile game protagonist, has this time gone into space. On a series of Joust-like 
levels, he must clear two stages on each level. 
 
The first stage is the fuel stage, where he must fly in his small shuttle from platform to platform 
and pick up fuel pellets. He can only carry one pellet at a time and must therefore return each of 
them to the mother ship that is parked on the bottom of the screen. Danger comes in the form of round 
objects that pass horizontally across the screen at various speeds. It cannot be predicted at what 
height they will enter the screen, but they can be shot down. 
 
The second stage is the loot stage, where Cuthbert must pick up the objects that come falling from 
the top of the screen, all the while avoiding the same objects as in the previous stage. 
 
Once Cuthbert has returned to the mother ship, they travel to the next level. During the space 
passage, you can encounter troubles, which is handled through a text-only interface. He may have to 
leave the ship to pick up spare parts, and then return them within a set time limit, or bombs will go 
off. This is a matter of simply adjusting a set of text coordinates, but the time limit makes the 
adjustment an urgent matter.

Cyberball (1887) (c) 1990 Atari Games Corporation / Domark Software Ltd. 
 
After American Football players started cheating by using bionic parts, the game was forced to change 
its rules. By 2022, the game was played not by humans, but two teams of seven robots. To spice things 
up, the usual pig skin ball was replaced with a 350 pound bomb. 
 
Cyberball brings this fast and furious action to life. Gameplay is essentially the same as the real 
sport, although the 'downs' are replaced by the bomb's heat gradually increasing towards 'critical'. 
After this it will explode and possession will be swapped. This is prevented when you cross the 
50-yard line, lose possession or score a touchdown, in which cases it resets to 'cool'. Field goals 
and punts are not featured - the only kick is the initial kick-off you receive. 
 
Control passes from the quarterback (thrower) to the intended catcher as soon as a pass is released. 
The two-player game is co-operative - on offense one player passes and the other receives

Players control a space marine who must search for droids on three planets - Geminus, Sirius, and 
Arius - while avoiding the planet's inhabitants and hazards. Energy is lost when players come into 
contact with an inhabitant. Up to three weapons can be used to destroy the inhabitants. Once all the 
droids have been collected, players make their way to the next planet where new inhabitants are 
introduced and the number of droids to be collected increases. Players have a limited amount of time 
to do this, but as well as energy and ammo, it can be replenished by purchasing more at the shop 
(only one shop per planet).

The follow-up to Cybernoid: The Fighting Machine is again a flip-screen shoot 'em up. In control of 
the deadly Cybernoid craft, your job is to rescue the cargo which has been stolen by a wave of pirate 
ships. 
 
Using the range of weapon systems correctly is again a key factor. These include sideways aiming 
guns, bouncing bombs, 'seeker' smart bombs, bombs which move around th edge of the screen before 
finding a target, and time-sensitive bombs which explode a few seconds after you drop them. Shot 
pirate ships release cargo, and you must collect at least 1500 points of this, but on many screens it 
is more prudent to make an escape ASAP, as some screens have more hazards than others, and not all 
aliens on each screen act in the same way.

Cybertron Mission (1898) (c) 1984 
 
Cybertron Mission is a top down game in which the player explores a maze of rooms to find various 
randomly placed items. Once found, touching a safe ends the level and starts the next level. Movement 
and firing are eight-directional. Touching a wall results in instant death by electrocution. Enemies 
generate in random positions when a room is entered. Linger in a room for too long, and "Spook" 
appears, a fast-moving creature that passes through walls, but can be temporarily stunned with shots. 
 
Each level is a maze of 4x4 rooms. In the first level, one item is needed and the player faces only 
slow moving "Spinners". In the second level, two items are needed and unpredictable "Clones" are 
added, that shoot back. In the third level, three items are needed, and the "Cyber-droid" is 
introduced. 
 
The player starts with five lives, and is awarded an extra life at regular score intervals, on 
reaching a new level, and on collecting a potion. 
 
The game is uniformly referred to in the game as Cybertron. Only on the cover is it called Cybertron 
Mission.

half-machine) sent to rendezvous with them and to find out what happened to them.  Upon landing, you 
discover the asteroid is in fact an alien ship bent on conquering Earth and only you can stop them. 
 
Each level of the alien ship has rooms to explore and you must either avoid sinister aliens and 
robots or destroy them.  Computer terminals encountered will give you access codes needed to enter 
locked areas of the ship.  The game screen has the top half showing your character and location scene 
while the bottom half has a read-out panel showing an analysis of items encountered and an options 
display with commands like: character analysis, scanner, examine, status, get, put, hold, and 
inventory. As a cyborg, you have a power unit which has a shield that depletes when firing shots but 
gradually regenerates.  If the shield is totally depleted then the power unit will sustain damage and 
you will die if it in turn is depleted.  This was one of the first games to have a black hero who was 
not a sports star.

If you are to be honored with the leadership of the Ostan race, you must explore a virtual reality 
world, collect the 24 objects which have been hidden within, and bring them all back to the base. 
 
Cylu is viewed isometrically, and primarily consists of solving puzzles along the lines of many 
Ultimate Play the Game titles. Only five objects can be carried at a time, which means the route 
involves a lot of back-tracking. This is slightly lessened once you find some of the teleport bays, 
and the key to operate them. 
 
There are 32 numbered forcefields around the game, and these must be deactivated by finding the 
appropriate silicon chip. Your droid requires regular re-fueling, either from canisters located in 
the early sections of the game, or from the RFL unit you can pick up later.

The third licensed game based around the legendary British decathlete did something slightly wider in 
scope than the basic Games style of play. Before you play the main events you have to train in the 
gym. Weight-lifting, squats and sit-ups are included, which involve waggling the joystick as fast as 
you can to fill a displayed bottle of Lucozade (clever bit of product-placement there). The better 
you do at this, the better you'll fare in the events, which are predominantly waggling-based as well. 
They include the standard decathlon events of running, jumping and throwing as well as you can. There 
are four types of shoes available, and choosing the wrong one for the event will seriously hamper 
your performance.

Daley Thompson's Super-Test (1931) (c) 1985 Ocean Software Ltd. / Ocean Software Ltd. 
 
Ten sporting events (twelve on the 128K Spectrum version) are recreated in the second game licensed 
around the Decathlon champion. Each one has its own world record, and a target time / distance / 
score to reach - fail and you lose one of your three lives. After completing all events successfully 
they repeat with tougher targets. 
 
Rowing, 100m and cycling are pure tests of joystick waggling, and this is a feature of may other 
events. The penalty shoot-out involves timing the run-up then pressing fire to set the angle of the 
shot. In the ski-jump, timing the launch and landing are crucial. The tug of war involves choosing a 
candidate you feel you can beat and then out-waggling them. 
 
In the triple jump you must run to the line before holding down fire for the right length of time for 
each of the 3 phases of the jump (45 degrees is optimal). The hurdles event involves running to and 
pressing fire to clear the hurdles. 
 
Pistol shooting gives you limited time to correctly move a sight into position, before firing as 
close to the centre as possible. This is made harder by only being able to move up and towards the 
target, which prevents being able to correct over-movement.

When a game is faithful to the poor writing and wildly implausible plot conventions of a soap opera, 
does that make it a bad game or an effective adaptation of its source material?  In any case, this 
game situates you as a private investigator hired by Sue Ellen to find a map to hidden oil fields, in 
hopes to accumulate enough wealth to escape the sinister influence of J.R.  You snoop around the 
grounds of the South Fork Ranch, superficially interacting with much-loved characters from the TV 
show and an assortment of extras from the animal kingdom.  So far, so good. 
 
Your travels ultimately lead you to the jungles around Playa Peligro, in South America, where you 
overcome a series of obstacles by using various techniques, but mostly by doping a friendly monkey 
with tobacco -- a firm reminder that we're descending beneath even soap opera plot conflicts and 
sitting squarely in an early-'80s text adventure game, with all of the internal logic-twisting that 
entails.

With a jolt you wake, reaching from your subconscious mind for a pencil and a clean sheet of paper

Upon opening your eyes, the puzzle is solved. No longer are you in uncle's study at Koenigsberg

track that winds on through gradually deepening woods and snow, on another one of uncle's “field

Dan Dare III - The Escape (1946) (c) 1990 Probe Software Ltd. / Virgin Mastertronic Ltd. 
 
In the third game in the Dan Dare series, Dan has been kidnapped by an evil alien race known as the 
Treens and taken to their scientific satellite orbiting Venus, but it doesn't take long for Dan to 
break free and goes down into their ship. While searching it, he eventually finds an escape shuttle 
sitting in the launch bay, only to discover that it is out of fuel. He returns to the satellite in an 
attempt to find some. 
 
The fuel cans are scattered around the five levels of the ship, which Dan can get to by using the 
Mekon's teleporters. To get to them though, Dan needs to destroy any Treen that gets in his way using 
a variety of weapons, brought by using a computer terminal. Along the way, the Mekon leader can be 
seen sitting around, and destroying him will more often than not reward Dan with a pod that he needs 
to access the teleporter. Dan can use his jet-pack to navigate the satellite, but this will 
eventually run out of fuel.

Dan Dare - Pilot of the Future (1944) (c) 1986 Gang of Five / Electronic Arts, Inc. 
 
A licensed game based around the cult comic strip character, recreating his daring attempts to defeat 
Mekon and save the earth. 
 
The Anastasia ship is attacked by the Treens as soon as Dan steps onto it, although fortunately he 
picks up a laser on board. From then on, he must act as fast as possible. 
 
The main task is to find each of the 5 parts of a planetary-destruction mechanism to the control 
room, so that it can be safely diffused. He can only carry one at a time, and once he gets the back 
he must find the correct socket for each one. Lastly he must escape to the surface. 
 
Contact with a Treen will see Dan kidnapped and placed in the prison area

Dandy (1949) (c) 1986 RamJam Corporation, The / Electric Dreams Software 
 
Although directly licensed to John Palevich's earliest interpretation of top-view dungeon-based 
slashing, this game's features are closest to Gauntlet, the coin-op it inspired. 
 
You play either Sheba or Thor (both are active in a simultaneous 2-player game) as you move through 
15 dungeons, with the aim of collecting all the available treasure. If this is done successfully, a 
code will be granted - put them all together at the end of the game. Foes are released in swarms 
through a control box. Once all these are dead you must destroy the box, to prevent respawning. 
 
The dungeons feature treasure, food (for energy), and spells. Be careful not to destroy these by 
shooting them. Each spell has a random function - disorientating, paralysing or killing the opponents 
on screen. Like Gauntlet you are constantly losing energy, however treasure can be traded in for 
energy.

Danger Mouse in Double Trouble (1952) (c) 1984 Creative Sparks / Creative Sparks 
 
Baron Greenback has created a clone of Danger Mouse, and needless to say his intentions are not good. 
Danger Mouse naturally springs into action, across 3 distinct stages of gameplay with platform and 
shoot 'em up elements. 
 
The first section involves flying along in your Aerocar, shooting as many of the bad guys as possible 
while avoiding as many as possible. The second involves avoiding contact with cats and monkeys, by 
jumping on the backs of crocodiles. The final section involves destroying the actual power unit for 
his Doppelganger in time to save Penfold.

Danger Mouse in the Black Forest Chateau (1953) (c) 1984 Creative Sparks / Creative Sparks 
 
Danger Mouse is back, fighting fit and ready to pit his wits against the mad Baron Silas Greenback in 
the Black Forest Gateau. Whoops! Chateau. 
 
Colonel K, head of a top secret department in which he does not know its names, sends Danger Mouse, 
along with his trusted assistant Penfold, to the Black Forest to destroy the Pi-beam, the Baron's 
secret weapon which poses a threat to world security. After DM says that it is an easy task, he and 
Penfold leave for Germany in their mousemobile. Unfortunately, finding the Pi-Beam would be difficult 
since the Baron has set many traps that DM needs to overcome. 
 
Danger Mouse in the Black Forest Chateau is an adventure game which involves the player reading a 
description of each scene, and choosing a number of options to proceed through to the next scene. The 
game is played in two parts. The second part cannot be played unless the first is completed since 
upon completion, the player is given a code to access the second part.

Indy Heat (3753) (c) 1992 Leland Corporation / Storm 
 
Danny Sullivan, 1988 IndyCar champion and winner of the classic 'Spin & Win' Indianapolis 500 in 
1985, put his name to this Super Sprint style racing game. There are 4 cars in each race, 1 or 2 
player options, and 9 tracks to race on, with the Tradewest Speed Bowl the ultimate target, and is 
much longer but with double points (it's essentially a substitute for the licensed-elsewhere 
Indianapolis 500, which did pay double the usual level of IndyCar championship points for many 
years). 
 
The player has limited fuel, and will run slowly if supplies run out, and the car can be damaged, 
although both are repairable in the pits. They get a turbo to use sparingly, which can also be 
recharged in the pits if they have bought more. After each race the player will get money (slightly 
more for a higher finish), which can be spent on upgrades such as improved power, brakes or more 
turbos.

Dante's Inferno (1959) (c) 1986 Denton Designs / Beyond - Challenging Software 
 
Dante's poem 'Inferno' details a man's journey through hell, in the hope of reaching purgatory. This 
computer game interpretation takes the form of a mazelike arcade adventure. You can hold two objects 
at a time, to use towards solving the puzzles. The objects you need are located in the initial 
forest, so lots of backtracking is required. 
 
Cross the River Styx through the boatman to reach the nine circles of hell. These represent people 
who will not go to Heaven based on Christian theologies, from non-Christians to those who breached 
the Seven Deadly Sins such as sloth and gluttony. Contact with these must be avoided if you are to 
prove yourself pure enough to enter purgatory.

The bulk of the game is side-viewed, involving single screens to pass through, which incorporate 
ropes, cages and trapdoor. There are enemies walking, flying and hovering through this, and many of 
them respawn. Unusually your weapon to take them on (rocks) can be thrown through 360 degrees, which 
aims to make the gameplay more realistic and methodical. The screens were linked by hub screens, 
which the player passes through simply by clicking on a door.

Dark Caves is a H.E.R.O. clone in which the you control a treasure hunter searching for treasure

number of bombs, you must reach the exit before running out of energy. The amount of energy available 
is displayed at the bottom of the screen. It depletes over time and when the jetpack or the beam 
weapon is used. When navigating through the caves, you must avoid contact with enemies, spikes and 
other deadly objects. The beam weapon can be used to dispatch enemies, while bombs are used to 
destroy walls. If you have run out of bombs, you can also use the beam weapon to destroy walls, which 
uses up a lot of energy. 
 
In the final level, a Tetris-inspired puzzle has to be solved. However, instead of clearing lines, 
the goal in this case is to fill up the lower part of the screen without leaving a gap.

In Driller, the Ketars attempted to blow up the moon Mitral, but you stopped them. Now, they have 
Energy Collection Devices collectively known as EGOs, and hope to stock them up to use towards the 
Zephyr One device, and direct its energy at the planet Evath, resulting in a catastrophic radiation 
overload. 
 
Your mission is to beam onto their base on the moon Tricuspid, and destroy the EGOs. Destroying one 
will buy you more of your limited time. The problem is, many are connected to at least 2 others, and 
those can immediately regenerate, so you must tackle them in an order in which those with only 1 
connection are attacked first. 
 
You are inside a space suit, propelled by a Jet Pack with limited fuel, and possess lasers and a 
shield. Shield energy is limited, but can be recharged through pentagons and rods. In a world viewed 
through the the Freescape 3D system, you roam the verdant planet of trees, buildings and underground 
tunnels. 
 
Gameplay has more action than Driller. The Freescape world has a third dimension - due to the jetpack 
you can leave the ground and look down on the view. You can also rotate the angle and make quick 
U-turns. You must leave the ground to shoot the active part of an ECD, but the jetpack uses energy at 
a faster rate, so use this feature sparingly. You must avoid Plexors, which weaken your shield, and 
deflector devices, which can beam you into prison.

Days of Thunder (2017) (c) 1990 Tiertex Design Studios / Mindscape, Inc. 
 
Tom Cruise's film brought NASCAR racing to the masses, and Mindscape did the same for games players 
with this license. If you mentally change the driver names, it can be thought of as a recreation of 
real NASCAR racing rather than a direct recreation of the film. 
 
You play Cruise's Cole Trickle character (his name, like many of the others, is slightly different to 
that of a real NASCAR racer of the day) against your rivals on 8 tracks, based on real-life 
counterparts. The races are all on ovals, although the exact lengths, corner types and gradients are 
varied.  This means that the ideal racing line on one track can put you into the wall on another. 
Qualifying is incorporated alongside the races themselves. 
 
From times to times you'll have to pull into the pit stop area. When doing so, you control the five 
members of the pit crew. Loosing time on pit will make you loose positions at the race. The other 
racers, however, never pit. 
 
The NES version has 3rd-Person perspective only.

Deactivators (2023) (c) 1986 Tigress Marketing / Ariolasoft UK 
 
Deactivators is an arcade-puzzle maze game which puts you in control of a squad of bomb disposal 
droids. You must pick them up and quickly throw them out of the building to safety - failure to do 
this costs you a droid and a room (occasionally blocking off other essential rooms). The game's 
levels have grid-like arrangements with doors, trapdoors and poles, and increase in size as the game 
goes on. For both these reasons, mapping is essential. 
 
Security droids are on patrol, but these can be tricked into falling down holes. A computer room is 
the hub of your activities - this allows you to use teleports and turn off force fields, via the 
appropriate circuit boards which are hidden throughout the levels. On later levels the gravity isn't 
constant and you will find rooms with distorted directional senses, increasing the precision required 
significantly.

floppy disks. This game does not innovate upon the genre, and is built on the gameplay of its 
predecessors.

Death Knights of Krynn (2043) (c) 1991 Strategic Simulations, Inc. / Strategic Simulations, Inc. 
 
Death Knights of Krynn is the 2nd volume of the Dragonlance epic and is the sequel to Champions of 
Krynn. Characters from that game may be imported to this game. 
 
This time the party faces an undead threat that turns former friends into fierce enemies and infests 
Krynn with hordes of decaying monsters. The party must find the origin of these nightmarish undead 
creatures and eliminate it in order to save Krynn from turning into a land of undead. 
 
Like Champions of Krynn, Death Knights of Krynn introduces a different and unique character selection 
with the availability of the "Knight" class, unavailable in AD&D non-Dragonlance RPGs. Characters in 
this game may level-up to higher levels and obtain new skills as well as more powerful spells. 
Experienced Knights may ultimately choose one out of 3 "clans" to focus more on a different type of 
fighting style. 
 
Adventuring consists of either overland map travel or the standard 1st person town adventure. The 
player's party consists of 6 characters (of which one must be a Knight) as well as possible NPC 
characters joining your party. Wandering monsters will of course attack the party on occasion so gear 
up and prepare for undead monster-bashing combat!

Deathlord (2053) (c) 1987 
 
An Ultima style RPG with an oriental flavor.  The Deathlord and his army of demons are destroying the 
land and Emperor Nakamoto has called upon you and your party to fight back and defeat him.  There are 
8 races and 16 classes to choose from along with a handy translation guide that tells you a Genkai is 
really a Wizard and a Ryoshi is a specialized Fighter.  The 84 spells also have Japanese names but 
their effects will be familiar to any fan of European style medieval adventures.  In fact, Deathlord 
even includes a utility to import and Easternize your characters from Bard’s Tale, Ultima III, and 
Wizardry. 
 
One other thing to note is that Deathlord is quite large.  The quest itself takes place on over a 
dozen continents each with multiple cities and dungeons.  According to the estimate on the package, 
it is designed to fill “a few hundred hours” of the player’s time.

Death Sword (12348) (c) 1988 Palace Software, LTD. / Epyx, Inc. 
 
The evil magician Drax is terrorizing the jeweled city and cast a spell over the beautiful princess 
Marina who is forced to obey him. From the lands to the north, a hero is sent to help the city and 
free the princess. He is Gorth, the strongest of the barbarian warriors. With his sword in hand, he 
has to beat eight of Drax's best warriors and at last the magician himself. He will fight them in the 
woods, on the mountaintop, in the dungeon... finally reaching Drax's palace itself. 
 
This is essentially a one- or two-player fighting game where you control a big barbarian and fight 
another player or a computer AI.  There are several kinds of hits, and some hits take off half a 
point while others take off a whole point. Each player has six of these "power points". They also 
have a special hard to perform "death sword" which decapitates your opponent, killing him with one 
fell swoop.

The actor Charles Bronson played the iconic role of vigilante Paul Kersey in 5 movies where he takes 
the law into his own hands when he doesn't get justice and criminals get off.  This game is based on 
Death Wish 3 which came out in 1985.  A friend of Kersey in New York has been killed and he takes to 
the streets to help the police lay waste to gangs that are brutalizing and rioting in the city. 
 
He has a bulletproof vest that will protect him from several shots and can wield 4 guns: the 475 
Wildey Magnum, shotgun, machine gun, and rocket launcher.  Avoid shooting grannies on the streets, 
mean street-walkers and the police who occasionally will help you take out the baddies.  If you start 
shooting policemen, they will turn on you too. 
The upper half of the screen shows you the side-view of the street or building you are in.  The lower 
half shows your score, high score, injury meter, a scrolling police report so you can know where 
crime is taking place, a compass direction, a map which will also show you where weapons and bosses 
are located, and which weapon you are holding and the ammo left. 
When you enter a building, you can fire out the window for higher points but beware of enemies that 
may come up behind you.

In this futuristic arcade-action 2D-isometric-looking game you slip into the role of the DECEPTOR on 
your quest to discover what your elders have set forth as your destiny. They taught you the way of 
transformation, your able to assume 3 forms helping you to master your quest. 
 
In-game you have to navigate the terrain of each of the 4 corridors and avoid its dangerous 
   inhabitants. Whenever you want you can transform into a land vehicle or a air vehicle to reach 
   higher platforms of the corridors. Each time you touch the ground with the air vehicle you will be 
   automatically transformed into the land vehicle (by pressing the fire button of your joystick you 
   can transform between land or air vehicle). 
 
At the end of each of the 4 corridors stands a gate and you will be forced with an guardian in order 
to pass to the next corridor. You have a limited amount of time to reach each gate. 
 
Reaching a gate at the end of an corridor will automatically transform you into your 3rd form: A 
humanoid.  Shoot at the guardian and hit him several times to destroy him. But you don't have 
unlimited ammunition, to increase your ammunition you must pick up units of it while you advance 
through a corridor. Beware of the deadly inhabitants willing to kill you and be fast enough to reach 
the gate to the next corridor within your limited time window. 
 
Should you be able to conquer all 4 corridors, you will realize your destiny and assume control of 
your future!

the North African theater during World War II.  The design is essentially the same as in the first 
Command game, Crusade in Europe.  Five different scenarios with multiple variants can be played.  
This, along with multiple levels of difficulty, gives the game significant replay value.  Battles

Deep Space (2067) (c) 1987 
 
It is the year 2123. The genetically-programmed warriors of the Andromedan Hegemony are making the 
first moves to enforce their government's greatest desire: the takeover of the United Planets of 
Solaria's fantastically wealthy new mines in the Asteroid Belt. On Earth, capitol of the United 
Planets, military and political leaders are beginning frantic efforts to marshal human and material 
resources to fight off the alien onslaught. 
 
There is a knock at the front entrance to your dwelling. You open the door, only half-surprised to 
see that your visitor is a courier robot, painted in the distinctive blue-and-white uniform colors of 
the Solarian Armed Forces. It registers your palm-print on its signature pad, then passes you a 
sealed file container. You know without opening the iile that it contains a draft notice and briefing 
materials. In a few hours you will be in the cockpit of a Katana single-seat interceptor, perhaps 
fighting for your life against the invading Andromedans.... 
 
So the stage is set for Deep Space -- Operation Copernicus. As the pilot of a Katana war vessel, you 
will have your choice of four missions to test your skill and tactics flying--and fighting--amid the 
hurtling debris of the asteroid cluster known as the Trojan Group. Survival is up to you!

Defender of the Crown (2082) (c) 1987 Master Designer Software, Inc. / Cinemaware Corporation 
 
Defender of the Crown puts you in the role of one of four Saxon knights in medieval England, in a 
time where the land is in turmoil as the King is dead and his crown was stolen. The Saxons and the 
Normans blame each other and fight for control of England. 
 
After a short introduction by Robin of Locksley himself, you start the game with a single castle and 
10 soldiers at your command. From there, you have to build your army, take control of additional 
territories and fight the three Norman lords - and sometimes your Saxon friends as well. 
 
The game has several different styles: You may either engage in a jousting contest where you have to 
knock your opponent off his horse using a lance, you can go raid a castle for loot or you can attack 
another territory/castle. 
 
The game was originally created on the Amiga platform in 1986 by Cinemaware with wonderful graphics 
by James D. Sachs and great music by Jim Cuomo, then ported to the PC whilst keeping its original 
appeal and quality.

There's plenty of reflection in this game, in both senses of the word. That's because this strategic 
puzzler involves using mirrors to direct a beam of light across a succession of 60 screens. Each 
mirror has 16 different angles it can be set at, each of which will send the beam around the screen 
in different ways. 
 
Before the exit is activated, all the mines on a screen must be cleared by running the beam over 
them. There are other devices built into the levels, including teleports and random angle-changers, 
as well as hazards to avoid (they cause the beam to overheat) and droids which go around moving the 
mirrors' directions.

Deja Vu - A Nightmare Comes True (2086) (c) 1987 ICOM Simulations, Inc. / Mindscape, Inc. 
 
Deja Vu was the first game ever made by ICOM, the makers of such famous adventure games as Shadowgate 
and Uninvited. It featured mouse support, a multi-window interface, and bitmapped graphics at a time 
when text-based interactive fiction was the norm. 
 
In Deja Vu your character wakes up in a toilet stall of a sleazy pub with no memory of who you are or 
what you're doing there. To make matters worse, you soon stumble upon a very dead corpse upstairs 
with three bullets buried in him. Sure enough, you find there's a gun in your pocket with three 
bullets missing. From there you have to figure out what happened and who you are before whatever is 
happening to your brain turns you into a mindless vegatable. To make matters worse the cops would 
very much like to have a word with you about that stiff. 
 
In 1991 a remake of this game was made for Windows 3.x, featuring improved graphics etc.

many sections in which the fairies are falling towards fiery pits, and you must catch them without 
hitting this pit. 
 
The controls allow you to jump, and then jump again while falling, so you can, with effort, climb 
most of the way up the screen. The forces of the Black Queen are out to stop you, including spiders, 
bats and goblins, and even the clouds and stalactites on the ceilings launch deadly droplets of 
distilled doom. A bonus level is offered sporadically, allowing you to collect coins for extra lives 
- although you start with 9, you'll need them, as the levels are long and treacherous.

Demon's Winter (2108) (c) 1988 Strategic Simulations, Inc. / Strategic Simulations, Inc. 
 
The land of Ymros was first encountered in Shard of Spring, and it returns in this follow up, which 
is viewed from above, but has a game-world 32 times the size of its predecessor. Your characters can 
include Humans, Elves, Dwarves and Trolls, each with different skills as well as generated and 
varying statistics, and one of 10 different character classes - Barbarian, Wizard and Scholar for 
Example. You will need to choose the right balance of these for your mission, which involves tracking 
down Malifon and gain revenge on the damage he has done to Ymros. 
 
Combat takes place via close-quarters combat and spell-casting, depending on the character's 
abilities. Towns can be visited to buy weapons, and you can return to your camp to worship one of the 
various Gods and receive their gifts such as resurrection and protection.

Denis Through the Drinking Glass (2116) (c) 1984 Applications Software Specialists / Applications 
Software Specialists 
 
Margaret Thatcher's late husband Denis was known to like a drop of gin, a fact frequently exploited 
by satirical magazine Private Eye. As such, this text adventure stars you as Denis, on his quest to 
escape Number 10 Downing Street (and Maggie) to get to the Gravedigger's Arms pub. 
 
Denis must get a drink within 10 moves, or else it is game over. The location descriptions are 
written in an unusual style, set to rhyme and featuring wry observations about the drudgery of 
political life from Denis' unique position. Similarly, the Help feature often gives terse, sarcastic 
and less-than-helpful responses. 
 
As you progress through the game, mock headlines from The Sun newspaper appear to comment on your 
situations. The game is written in Quill, a popular adventure creation package from Gilsoft 
themselves.

Grand Jeu des Chiffres et des Lettres, Le (14219) (c) 1987 Loriciels / Loriciels 
 
Des Chiffres et des Lettres ("Numbers and Letters") is a French game show which inspired the similar 
British programme Countdown. Two players compete in a sequence of rounds challenging language and 
arithmetic skills. In this version you can turn off either type of rounds, and can have infinite time 
to think in each round, if you wish. 
 
In letters rounds, an array of 9 letters is chosen by each player alternately choosing either a vowel 
or a consonant, and players must find the longest possible legitimate word. In numbers rounds, an 
array of face-down numbers (including 25, 50, 75 and 100 as well as 2 each of 1-10) is presented to 
the player, who chooses the number of 'large' numbers. A target between 101 and 999 is then 
generated, and players must get as close to this as possible. Additionally, there are mental 
arithmetic challenge rounds, in which players must solve an equation as quickly as possible.

Deus Ex Machina (2146) (c) 1986 Automata U.K. Limited / Electric Dreams Software 
 
Deus Ex Machina is an unusual and experimental game by Mel Croucher. In 1987 all UK records of the 
Department of Health and Social Security, Police and State Security are then coordinated in a central 
data bank. The year after, passport, censorship operations and communications were integrated. By 
1994, the computer controlled all defense and internal security. Tuesday evening, the machine 
rebelled ... 
 
Players take control and follow the life of a "defect", in the shape of a human body, that has formed 
inside the machine. It is taken through all stages of life, from cells to senility, with many quotes 
from and references to William Shakespeare's The Seven Ages of Man from the play As You Like It ("All 
the Screen's stage and all the men and women merely players. They have their exits and their 
entrances, and one person in their time plays many parts, their Acts being Seven Ages"). The game is 
advertised as audio-visual entertainment. It contains no sound, but there is a cassette tape that 
needs to be played along with the game. Both sides contain 23 minutes of sound, forming 46 minutes 
which is also the length of the game as it is meant to be played in a single sitting. The tape's 
soundtrack contains singing, musical compositions, and speeches by a number of famous voice actors. 
They vaguely clarify the different stages of the game and often tease the player based on what is 
happening. The full transcript of the speech is also included in the manual. 
 
The player has to guide the defect through the different stages of life, constantly followed by the 
defect police. The game cannot be lost, but based on a number of actions a percentage shown all the 
time will vary. The player's controls consists of four directions, and the combination can form 
diagonal movement. The effect of the controls is different for every screen. Deus Ex Machina is based 
on a number of vignettes with limited gameplay. There are no win conditions for any part and controls 
do not appear to affect the game's progress. Screens have the player move a green dot between strings 
of DNA, ward off the defect police examining the body, jump over words such as "LIES" or "WAR" - 
where the relevance and atmosphere is generally provided through the background soundtrack. The game 
can be played without sound, but it does not make any sense that way. There are in-game instructions 
to synchronize and turn the tape.

An eccentric old millionaire stored all his gems and money in odd places around his mansion. When he 
dies, his widow is unable to find any of this, so she hires master thief Devon Aire to look in the 
places his criminal mindset suggests it will be stored. 
 
Each room of the house is viewed isometrically, and contains all the features you would expect to 
find in a large house, from cookers and telephones to pool tables and paintings. Each one can be 
picked up, pushed, pulled and used, with the diamonds located in intricate and surprising places. 
 
Due to Mr. Croucher's keen interest in experimental science, there are also monsters moving through 
the rooms. Contact with these reduces some of the energy on one of your 3 lives.

the earth, and you can use these rocks to squash them. If the monsters do not find you for several 
seconds, they will eventually get turned into ghosts, which are able to walk through the earth. They 
are invincible and cannot be killed. From time to time, vegetables will appear in the center, and you

Dino Wars (2199) (c) 1991 DigiTek Software / Magic Bytes 
 
Dino Wars is a strategic board game with some similarities to chess, with combat decided by action 
scenes. If you ever played Archon you know the idea behind this game. 
 
On a chess-like board (9x10 pieces in this game) you move different sorts of dinosaurs. If you hit an 
square on which an opponent dinosaur stands, the game changes to action mode. This is played as a 
beat-'em-up, in which you must beat the opponent dinosaur to win the square. Each dinosaur has it's 
own strategies, movement restrictions and different combat skills - which are roughly based on the 
historical properties of the real dinosaurs. As a result, knowing which dinosaurs are likely to win 
combat is crucial to the strategy. 
 
The action scenes can be played independently of the main strategic game.

This game follows the adventures of Scrooge McDuck and his three nephews, Huey, Dewey and Louie. 
 
The aim of the game is shown in the introduction. Flintheart Glomgold challenges Scrooge to a 
competition to see who the richest duck in the world is. They each have 30 days to see who can get 
the most money together and finally their dispute will be settled. 
 
Scrooge’s office is your headquarters. Here you have three options – you can go exploring for 
treasure, play the stock market or dive into your money bin, occasionally finding a rare coin which 
adds to you treasure total. You need to get some money first before you can play the stock market 
though. 
 
You main source of income comes from the exploration map which hangs on the wall. From here, you can 
pick a destination, which you can travel to. There are four different scenarios when travelling to 
various parts of the world. It’s these levels that are the most fun. You can choose to go mountain 
climbing, jungle bashing, search a cavern, or photograph some rare animals depending on your 
location. On screen information tells you which scenario it is, how long the trip will take and how 
much the treasure is worth. There’s also an island in the Indian Ocean you can visit to check on 
who’s winning between you and Glomgold. 
 
You have to fly to each location and your transport is LaunchPad McQuack! You have to take off at the 
airport and fly to the destination. There are obstacles along the way though, watch out for 
powerlines (these are really funny, you run into them and boing! bounce back)

have to guess if the next throw will be higher or lower than the current one. 
 
Dizzy Dice features two game modes. The first one you play as a normal fruit machine. But then there 
also is the bank mode, where you start with $20 and need to reach $100 to break the first bank. In 
total there is five banks, each requiring more cash to win. The game is controlled using the 
keyboard.

Dizzy - The Ultimate Cartoon Adventure (2217) (c) 1988 Codemasters Software Company Limited, The / 
Codemasters Software Company Limited, The 
 
Dizzy's world is being harassed by the evil wizard Zaks! You play as Dizzy, the anthropomorphic egg, 
and you must search the land for a Leprechaun's Wig, a Cloud's Silver Lining, a Vampire Dux Feather, 
and Troll Brew, to make a potion to defeat Zaks with. 
 
This is the first game in a long line of platform/adventure games starring Dizzy. In this game, like 
all Dizzy adventure games, gameplay is standard platformer fare, except there inventory items 
scattered around the world, which are necessary to overcome obstacles and progress through the game. 
The world expands in all four compass directions, items are frequently far away from the obstacles 
they are used on, and you can only hold one item in your inventory at a time (later games gave you 
more baggage space), so much backtracking is necessary! 
 
One thing unique about the first Dizzy game is that there are MANY more monsters and hazards in this 
one than in later Dizzys. Also unique is that some inventory items are used to destroy monsters. For 
example, one of the first inventory items you find is birdseed. As long as birdseed is the item in 
your inventory, you destroy any birds you touch. But this made it necessary to juggle items 
excessively often, so the concept was dropped from the sequels in favor of more inventory-based 
puzzles.

Centuries of pollution have destroyed the environment, causing the few survivors to live beneath the

attempts to put things right by convincing people to return overground. 
 
Gameplay has several distinct elements, beginning with creating a character by balancing strength, 
endurance, luck, charisma and intelligence. Each area you travel through is described in text, and 
you will be presented with options as to where to explore, hide, flee, fight etc. Fights involve the 
gameplay moving into one-on-one beat 'em up territory, which has several moves on the C64 version but 
is more timing-related on the Spectrum implementation.

The Dolphin's Pearl (c) 1985 Admacadiam / Reston Computer Group 
 
This is an unusual action/puzzle game in which the player controls a dolphin.  The player must first 
learn to swim through a large ocean world, avoiding sharks, and surfacing for air after being at most 
eight minutes under water.  When surfacing for air the dolphin must also avoid being caught in the 
nets of a tuna boat. 
 
The player must find a “color current” below the surface, a sort of tunnel through which their 
dolphin must swim without being pushed out by the strong current.  Success is rewarded with a visual 
insight (dream) into the meaning of life and dolphin lore.  This is accompanied by a particular 
pattern of dolphin clicks and whistles that is important to remember. 
 
Next the player must find a particular color current in the ocean, from which emanates the click and 
whistle phrase heard in the dream.  Successfully swimming through this color current leads the 
dolphin to the seabed.  There the player must find a mysterious rune, which might be a particular 
fish or piece of coral reef, and touch it.  This releases a fragment of hieroglyph that appears on 
the bottom of the screen. 
 
The player must then arrange the hieroglyphic characters in the proper order, using the 
“Dolphinese-English dictionary” found in the printed manual.  Doing so correctly leads to another 
visual insight sequence, and a new click and whistle phrase.  The player then finds the next 
corresponding color current, seabed rune, and hieroglyph fragment, and so on until all nine 
hieroglyph fragments are found and solved.  Supposedly, the hieroglyph puzzle, when completely 
solved, gives clues to where, in real life, there was an actual pearl hidden somewhere in America.

Donkey Kong (2260) (c) 1983 Nintendo Co., Ltd. / Atarisoft 
 
Released in the arcades in 1981, Donkey Kong was not only Nintendo's first real smash hit for the 
company, but marked the introduction for two of their most popular mascots: Mario (originally 
"Jumpman") and Donkey Kong. 
 
Donkey Kong is a platform-action game that has Mario scale four different industrial themed levels 
(construction zone, cement factory, an elevator-themed level, and removing rivets from girders) in an 
attempt to save the damsel in distress, Pauline, from the big ape before the timer runs out.  Once 
the rivets are removed from the final level, Donkey Kong falls, and the two lovers are reunited.  
From there, the levels start over at a higher difficulty. 
 
Along the way, Mario must dodge a constant stream of barrels, "living" fireballs, and spring-weights. 
 Although not as powerful as in other future games, Mario can find a hammer which allows him to 
destroy the barrels and fireballs for a limited amount of time.  Additionally, Mario can also find 
Pauline's hat, purse and umbrella for additional bonus points. 
 
Donkey Kong is also notable for being one of the first complete narratives in video game form, told 
through simplistic cut scenes that advance the story.  It should also be noted that in versions of 
the game for early 1980's consoles, Donkey Kong only used 2-3 of the original levels, with the cement 
factory usually omitted.

The lovely Marian was rescued from the clutches of the Black Warriors gang by Billy & Jimmy Lee in 
the first Double Dragon game, but now the gang has killed her in retaliation of their early defeat. 
The Dragons must now embark on a mission to avenge her death and defeat the Black Warriors for the 
second and final time. 
 
The original arcade version of "Double Dragon II" was essentially an improved version of the first 
game. In addition to offering renewed audio and visuals, as well as new traps, moves and enemy 
characters, "Double Dragon II" discarded the conventional punch and kick buttons in favor of a 
direction-oriented attacking system similar to the original Technos beat-em-up Renegade. 
 
The NES version offered new stages, new moves and illustrated cut-scenes, as well as a new final boss 
and a new ending. Unlike the first NES game, it offered 2-Player Co-Op gameplay with the option to 
turn off the friendly fire. 
 
The Game Boy version of "Double Dragon II" is an English localization of a "Kunio-kun" game (the

Dragon Breed (2310) (c) 1990 Irem Corp. / Activision, Inc. 
 
Zambaquous has done everything to make life hell for the people of Agamen, and as their King Kayus, 
the time has come to head out to destroy him. This leads to six levels of horizontally-scrolling 
shoot ‘em up action, although with some vertical movement as well. 
 
The thing which sets the game apart from every other horizontally-scrolling shoot ‘em up (except 
Saint Dragon) is that you are riding on the back of a dragon, called Bahamoot. Both you and the 
dragon have firepower, and holding down the fire button increases Bahamoot’s energy bolt’s ferocity. 
The dragon’s tail can be controlled indirectly, and because it is indestructible, it can be used 
either as a shield, or as a weapon in its own right. 
 
There are power-ups to collect by dismounting from the dragon and walking into them. These include 
fiery breath, bolts shot from Bahamoot’s tail, homing missiles of sorts, and lightning bolts, with 
only one ever active at a time. Each level has a time limit.

DragonHawk (2325) (c) 1983 United Microware Industries, Inc. / Creative Software 
 
You take control of the titular Dragon Hawk and must kill a number flying creatures such as buzzards, 
phoenixes, dragon puppies and others by pouncing on them from above - similar to Joust. Naturally, 
your enemies can kill you in the same way. To keep the Dragon Hawk in the air, you have to rapidly 
press the fire button in order to make him flap his wings. 
 
The faster the Dragon Hawk flaps its wings, the more difficult it is to control. However, if you are 
taking too much time, lighting bolts will start to shoot from the sky.  To stand a chance against the 
increasingly tough groups of enemies, you receive an extra life at every 1000 points. Killed enemies 
also drop feathers that can be collected for extra points. Once you have defeated all standard 
enemies, you must face a large, fire-breathing serpent.

Dragonriders of Pern (2326) (c) 1983 Connelley Group, The / Epyx, Inc. 
 
Dragonriders of Pern is a strategy game with action sequences, based on the novels by Anne McCaffrey, 
with a strong emphasis on diplomacy. The game may be played by 1 to 4 players. You take on the role 
as a Weyrleader fighting the deadly Thread. 
 
The game consists of two major phases: Negotiation/Intrigue, where you negotiate with Lord Holders or 
Craftsmasters, and Thread Fighting. where you fight the Thread from infesting your lands. 
 
The strategic part is the main part of the game. Here you try to negotiate with Lord Holders of 
Craftsmasters to make allies in your fight against the Thread. You can facilitate negotiations by 
organizing special events: To win the confidence of a Lord Holder who fancies dragons, invite him to 
a Hatching. Weddings also provide opportunities to score diplomatic points. 
When diplomatic maneuvers fail you, you may be forced to resort to a duel -- a wounded leader is 
unable to take any actions for a long time --, but this may jeopardize your status with peaceful 
leaders. Finally, conclaves may be called up after certain events like the death of a Weyrleader. A 
Dragonrider conclave will cancel all ongoing events for all Weyrs. A Lord Holder conclave will only 
cancel events involving Lord Holders and the Master Harper. Time passes in realtime during the 
strategic phase, but you can pause the game. 
 
Thread fighting occurs at the end of each year. During this phase of the game, you mount your dragons 
and you must pursue the falling Thread and char it in midair with the dragon's fiery breath before it 
lands. Miss a Thread and it may destroy you... or hit the ground and turn the land to dust. At the 
beginning of the game, you can select the difficulty of the Thread fighting or disable it entirely. 
 
Dragon Riders of Pern ends after a certain number of turns (also to be selected at game beginning), 
when a player reaches a certain number of "Victory Points" awarded for forging alliances, or when a 
certain number of Holds are infested by threads.

DragonsDen (2327) (c) 1983 Commodore Electronics Ltd. / Commodore Electronics Ltd. 
 
In DragonDen you're playing as Den, a knight armed with a lance on a flying horse. 
 
The controls are easy, move your joystick left and right, use the joystick-button to fly higher, 
normally the horse sinks automatically down to the ground. 
 
The game is split in 6 stages. In stage 1 you must use your lance to hit dragon eggs on the 
ground.Once you hit them the eggs open and little dragons fly away and attack you. After all eggs are 
hit, you gain a lance. Hit the dragons once with your lance to kill them. 5 eggs, 5 little dragons. 
 
The 2nd stage brings you to a catacomb where the screen scrolls from the left to the right and 
spiders cross your way. Avoid them. Stage 3 is almost the same: This time flying birds cross your 
path while a spinning blade hovers near the roof. Avoid the blade and avoid or kill the birds. Then, 
in Stage 4, you must avoid arrows until you reach the end of the catacombs. 
 
There - in stage 5 - a huge dragon egg awaits you. The dragon inside needs to get out of the egg. 
Kill the flying birds with your lance to crack the egg to release the dragon. At last, in stage 6, 
you must lance the dragon four times to kill it. If you're able to beat this flying dragon then you 
mastered the 1st level. The game repeats about 4 or 5 times, the monsters getting more aggressive, 
gameplay gets faster until you face the final dragon boss. Beating him - he falls in love with your 
flying horse :) ...

Dragon's Keep (12028) (c) 1984 Sierra On-Line, Inc. / Sierra On-Line, Inc. 
 
A children's game designed in the same spirit of the Hi-Res Adventure series (Mission:Asteroid, 
Mystery House, etc.). 
 
A dragon has captured 16 animals (a dog, a bird, a fish, a turtle, a cat, a squirrel, a rabbit, a 
pig, a bear, a monkey, a cow, a calf, a hen, a puppy, a frog, and a raccoon) that must be freed. 
 
Starting at your home, you travel to different locations to find all the animals that the dragon has 
captured.  Watch out for the dragon.  If you see him, you can't free the animal in the same picture. 
 
Young adventurers simply choose their action from a short list of choices.  The adventure world is 
very small and the animals are easily found by looking everywhere.

Dragon's Lair (2321) (c) 1986 Cinematronics, Inc. / Software Projects Ltd. 
 
The first port of the popular arcade game Dragon's Lair to a home computer, featuring the infamous 
Dirk the Daring. 
 
The game, as one would expect from the long-running Dragon's Lair series, has mixed gameplay, 
including platform, puzzle and arcade (in the old-fashioned choose-your-path sort of way). 
 
This first port includes two adventures: the first is to raid the lair of Singe the Dragon (hence the 
classic name) and rescuing Princess Daphne, and the second, in a sort of instant sequel of the first 
chapter, features Dirk trying to escape from the castle, now overrun by the Lizard King and its 
minions.

Dragon's Lair Part II - Escape from Singe's Castle (2322) (c) 1987 Sullivan Bluth Interactive Media, 
Inc. / Software Projects Ltd. 
 
Dirk the Daring is a heroic, if clumsy knight. When Princess Daphne was kidnapped by the dragon, 
Singe, and taken to his castle... Dirk set out to rescue her. Due to a lack of disk and memory space 
in the systems of the day, the port of the arcade game, Dragon's Lair was split into two parts. The 
first part covered the half of the game dealing with entering Singe's Castle and saving the Princess. 
This second part, named Dragon's Lair II: Escape from Singe's Castle completes the game, continuing 
the adventure of Dirk the Daring after slaying Singe the Dragon. 
 
Dirk the Daring is controlled by the player, who views Dirk's actions on the screen from 
third-person. The game is reactive and players must press the right controller direction or action 
button at the right time to have Dirk avoid traps, defeat monsters and otherwise stay alive.

Dragon Wars takes place in the magical land of Dilmun, an island of salvation perverted into a world 
of horror by Namtar (as you might expect - the bad guy). 
 
The player starts with a party of four in the city of Purgatory, equipped with nothing more than.. 
well - nothing. Worst of all your magic users won't help you out, either, because magic has been 
banned (to correct this unpleasing situation is one of your main objectives). 
Other main targets are surviving, getting out of Purgatory and toppling Namtar (maybe getting some 
decent clothing, one or two shiny swords and the like on your way out). 
 
Gameplay instantly reminds of the Bard's Tale series. Step-by-step first person 3D, opponents 
materialize out of the air. The combat system is turn based. 
 
Unlike its (spiritual?) predecessors the game features a full-blown skill system, auto-mapping and 
many places to actually use all these abilities. 
Reasonable distribution of your skill points is rather critical.

"Drazen Petrovic Basket" is a game based on the great European basketball player (who dramatically

mode, it is, you will start in 1/8 final and according to your results you will continue on the fight 
for the title or not. An interesting point of the game is that all the teams are composed by five 
players: one guard, two forwards and two centers, everyone with the typical characteristics of his 
position and with the possibility of being controlled at every moment. There are also personal 
faults, so if anyone of your players gets the fifth one he will be expelled of the court, but that's 
not all, the game also allows you to request time outs, two for each game period, giving you the 
possibility of changing the tactics, seeing the game stats, etc.

Dream Warrior (2347) (c) 1988 Tarann Ltd. / U.S. Gold Ltd. 
 
In the future, the world is controlled by corporations rather than governments, and wars are fought 
in a dream world rather than in reality.  The corporations can control dream demons to defeat their 
foes, but resistance fighters still defy them.  The player is one of these resistance fighters hoping 
to rescue some friends from the control of Ocular, the mightiest of all dream demons. 
 
Gameplay is somewhat reminiscent of Xenophobe, with the player moving through side-scrolling, 
space-station-like environments shooting at an endless onslaught of strange creatures.  By making 
good use of power-ups and gaining access to new levels, the player can eventually find Ocular, which 
can only be defeated if all six of its eyes are shot closed.

proves to be a gateway to what was a nostalgic experience even then, the heterosexual rite of 
passage: a night of heavy petting and perhaps "getting to third base" in a parked car at the local

girlfriend's ardour before taking it to the back seat and freeing yourselves of some of that 
cumbersome clothing.  Oh, say!  Is that my hand?  How did that get there?

Drol (2360) (c) 1983 Brøderbund Software, Inc. / Brøderbund Software, Inc. 
 
Drol is a platform game where you play a cute robot that can fly and shoot. Your goal is to rescue 
children that are wandering around each level. The levels consist of rows of platforms, with gaps 
which can be jumped through to go up or down a vertical level. The creatures to avoid and shoot vary 
from strange hopping, beer-belly aliens, to demons, snakes, and axes flying through the air (we never 
do find out who's throwing those axes!). 
 
Like Defender, Drol incorporates a "radar"  at the top of the screen, so you can find the children 
and dodge incoming baddies.

Dropzone was the first game to propel Archer Maclean to stardom. The game, originally written for the 
8-bit Ataris, is basically a Defender clone, but popular because it so closely recreates the gameplay 
of the original Defender, with its speedy scrolling and frantic gameplay. 
 
The player is a spaceman with a jet-pack, flying across a barren landscape whose skies are inhabited 
by a number of different aliens

Druid (2364) (c) 1986 
 
Druid is an action game inspired by the arcade hit Gauntlet. As the eponymous hero, your job is to 
destroy four magic skulls hidden over eight levels. 
 
The game is presented in a top-down view. The druid walks around the terrain seeking out the 
staircase that leads to the next level. On the way, he is harassed by hordes of monsters that come 
out of every direction and attack him, decreasing his health. To defend himself, the druid can use 
the spells of water, fire or electricity to toss projectiles. However, these magical weapons have 
limited ammo. 
 
The druid also has three other magical spells at his disposal - an invisibility spell which prevents 
the monsters from automatically approaching him, a golem spell which summons a helpful golem (which 
can be controlled by a second player), and a skull spell which destroys all on-screen enemies. The 
druid also carries around keys which open locked doors. But all these have very limited supplies. 
 
On his way, the druid finds many shops. Each such shop contains some keys or charges for the druid's 
spells, but the druid can only pick one item from each shop. 
 
The druid can also come across a pentagram on the ground which will restore his lost health.

Duck Punt (c) 1990 
 
By the time you've read the name and appreciated the pun, you've already achieved an understanding of 
half of this game's appeal.  From there, little is left to the imagination: two teams on an American 
football field take turns with possession of a duck (rubber, presumably, given the distances 
achieved) attempting to kick it (as the author ad-libs, a fowl ball) to the goal line... and victory! 
 
In the C64 original you would specify the short or long punt, so as to not drastically overshoot near 
the goal line and be forced to buy a new duck with a point deduction.  Also, sporadically the game 
would declare that an interception had occurred (or, steady yourselves, an ab-duck-tion). 
 
A modern remake has been produced for contemporary operating environments with numerous interface and 
gameplay enhancements.

Ducks Ahoy! (2374) (c) 1984 Joyce Hakansson Associates, Inc. / CBS Software 
 
Ducks Ahoy! is a simple game, taking place in Venice. On the screen you see some houses, the canal 
and the beach (on the top). The player is in control of a boat which can carry 2 ducks at the same 
time. 
The ducks start to walk around the houses slowly getting to the exit where they just jump out into 
the open no matter if there is a boat waiting for them or it's just water. 
The aim is to catch the ducks with the boat and deliver them to the beach. To make things more 
difficult there's a hippo in the water swimming around (always where the bubbles on the surface are). 
If the hippo catches the boat the player loses a life. After 10 ducks are delivered to the beach they 
start to sing and the the game restarts, increasing the difficulty by making the ducks faster.

Blood Valley (875) (c) 1987 Imagitec Design Ltd. / Gremlin Graphics Software Ltd. 
 
A loose adaptation of the 1986 pair of fantasy gamebooks, this game gives a solo player the 
opportunity to control the actions of The Quarry (player's pick of barbarian, priest or thief), a 
slave who is once a year selected to run free temporarily, before being run down in the valley of 
Gad, hunted by its cruel ruler the Archveult, and tortured to death.  Survival is possible only 
through escaping the valley or slaying the hunter.  (A second player has the option of controlling 
the pursuing Archveult simultaneously in splitscreen mode.) 
 
The duel the game sets up is only the last of many threats -- the game imposes countless re-spawning 
enemies in the players' paths, needing to be endlessly slain with a tap of the attack button (and 
their random loot gathered with a tap of a different button) while remaining always on the move and 
attempting to achieve a shopping list of incremental objectives necessary for greater success, 
"helpfully" listed on the screen at all times in most versions.

Temple of Apshai, The (7810) (c) 1983 Epyx, Inc. / Epyx, Inc. 
 
Temple of Apshai is the first in Automated Simulations' Dunjonquest series of role-playing games 
series and one of the first computer role-playing games. 
 
The game could be described as a graphical "roguelike", but actually it resembles the mainframe 
classic DND more, as you cannot see the whole level, but only your surroundings. Furthermore, the 
level maps are not randomized like in Rogue. Still, the gameplay has a lot in common with Rogue and 
other early dungeon crawls: A solo character explores a monster-infested, multi-level dungeon to grab 
some treasure, everything in top-down view. 
 
The game starts at the Innkeeper by creating a new character (if you already played the game, you can 
use characters that you created). You get different stat values (in Dungeons & Dragons style) as well 
as an amount of money that you can spend on weapons, armor and other equipment. Alternatively, you 
can just enter the stats to "import" characters from other role-playing games. (This is also used as 
a primitive "save / load game" mechanism.) 
 
After character generation, you enter the dungeons. On the left, the current room of the dungeon is 
displayed

Side-scrolling beat 'em ups in which you must rescue a trapped female friend are nothing unusual. 
Being able to use direct-combat moves as well as collecting bonus weapons, and food for energy 
recharging, is pretty typical as well. Games of this type that were converted from the arcade to home 
computers are particularly commonplace - Renegade and the Double Dragon series are famous examples. 
 
Where this one stands out, however, is the setting of your character as a duck called Bin, and with 
motion having a clear waddling appearance. The enemies to fight are all from the animal kingdom, but 
somewhat warped - crocodiles with boxing moves and cows armed with rocket packs for example. Bin has 
six levels to clear before he can rescue Lucy from Archaca's clutches.

Conversion of the Capcom arcade to home computers. The player adopts the identity of an ancient

archers. 
 
The game uses a lateral scroll and the player can move in all four directions. A novelty is the 
attack system: when pressing fire the energy of the attack will load up as the warrior moves his 
spear up and backwards, in order to gain momentum. The more the player can keep fire pressed, the 
more powerful the attack will be. 
 
The game spawned a sequel in the arcades, "Warriors of fate", and is not to be confused with the PSX 
game of the same title, which is a one-on-one fighting game.

EOS - Earth Orbit Station (2437) (c) 1987 
 
Earth Orbit Stations is a space program simulation where you run a privately owned space station. It 
focuses on the commercial aspects of space flight, as opposed to governmental or military aspects. 
 
In the near future of the year 1996, you have been appointed space director. Your goal is to build 
space stations, conduct research, market products, and compete against up to three other directors. 
These can be controlled either by the computer or by other players. There are various missions with 
distinct objectives: the tasks range from rescue operations, pure research or space colony 
construction to a search for intelligent extraterrestrial life. 
 
In the course of the game, you can build 39 different modules, including command, life, chemical lab, 
solar collector, and communications. Most of the missions require special units: for a Mars rescue 
operation, you first need to build a space hospital, for example. It's also possible to launch 
shuttles and probes from the station. 
 
Reaching the goals of each scenario requires money. You can sell new products, request help from 
commercial sponsors, and even use ads to attract more buyers. To make this game even more 
challenging, you constantly have to watch your opponents, because if any of them achieves the goal 
first, you lose.

Edd must progress up the levels within the time limit (water will come up to drown him - presumably 
polluted water through which a duck can't swim), while collecting every star. Bad guys can be stunned 
by shooting them, which makes them safe to touch, although nothing other than Edd actually dies. The 
levels are all themed around particular areas of the BBC offices, including a sci-fi set and the 
weather room.

bottom, take it to the top or outside the marked center of the screen or it will hatch an alien that 
will kill you. You can walk to the egg and push your fire button to grab the egg so you can move it 
up higher to give you time to push the button. In later levels, the buttons slide down the screen. 
Just keep going to see how high you can get your score.

Elevator Action (2470) (c) 1986 Taito Corporation / Quicksilva Ltd. 
 
You are Agent 17 (codename: "Otto"). Your mission is to secure all top secret documents from a 
security building and escape in the getaway car, located in the basement of the building. 
 
Enemies spies are scattered throughout the 30-floor building and they have only one mission: execute 
Agent 17 at all costs. There are several ways in which Agent 17 can kill them: 
 
1. Shooting them with his gun. 
2. Kicking them by jumping onto them. 
3. Shooting a light on the ceiling while in an elevator, dropping the light onto one of them. 
4. Crushing them with an elevator. 
 
Whenever a light has been dropped, the hallways will be dark for a short period of time, making the 
enemy spies harder to see. The same holds true for hallways that are already dark. 
 
While Otto is in an elevator, he will have complete control of it by moving up or down. Agent 17 can 
still get killed if he's already in an elevator if a bullet's trajectory is aimed at it.. When Otto 
is not in an elevator, it will move from floor to floor automatically, even when enemy spies are in 
it. Otto is able to leap over the elevator gaps, but he must be as close to the edge as possible 
without falling off in order to make the jump safely. If there is an elevator cable in the way, 
however, it will block him, causing him to fall. 
 
Just because the game is called Elevator Action doesn't mean that elevators are the only means of 
travel. There are also escalators which you can ride up or down, useful if you want to avoid gunfire 
and don't have time to jump. 
 
Otto must go into the rooms with red doors to collect the top secret documents. If he tries to get to 
his car without getting all the documents, he cannot escape and must go back and collect the 
remaining documents. Once he has all the documents and drives away, he then proceeds to the next 
building. 
 
If Otto takes too much time to collect the documents, the alarm will go off, and he will have trouble 
controlling the elevators, which will take time to react. Bad guys will be especially aggressive. The 
alarm doesn't go off when Otto loses a life, it only resets after finishing a building. Besides 
ducking, bad guys may also drop themselves and lay flat on the floor. It's virtually impossible for 
Otto to shoot bad guys when they do this. Also, Otto cannot duck when in an elevator.

Eliza (2478) (c) 1983 Artificial Intelligence Inc. 
 
ELIZA was the first chatterbot to make a splash in popular culture, originally written and conceived 
by Dr. Joseph Weizenbaum of MIT in 1966 to mockingly ape the style of a person-centered ("Rogerian") 
psychotherapist or counselor, largely by prompting the user to elaborate on topics sampled from 
previous user input.  A typical session would take the form of a typed dialogue (sometimes with 
simulated typing errors to further the suspension of disbelief), with the computer asking the user a 
series of questions and being fed responses from which to generate further questions. 
 
ELIZA stimulated early consideration of computer artificial intelligence (or the appearance thereof), 
not infrequently passing the Turing test and fooling users into believing (for a little while, at 
least) that they were interacting with a real human being on the other end... blazing a trail 
subsequently followed down by Perry the Paranoid and Racter.  Additionally, the nods its 
conversational interface made toward natural language processing (or, again, the appearance thereof) 
are considered to have been influential on the early mainframe development of the interface for text 
adventure games such as Adventure and Zork. 
 
Considered as a game, ELIZA is nearly the polar opposite to Emily Short's Galatea -- instead of the 
player probing the computer with questions, the computer probes the player with them.  Many different 
stories will still be revealed, but in this case, that's because it'll be people tricked by the 
program into telling them.

Elvira II (2486) (c) 1992 Horror Soft / Flair Software Ltd. 
 
Elvira - a horror movie star, a witch, and your girlfriend - is in trouble. A demon Cerberus has 
kidnapped her in order to kill her and gain her power. To save Elvira, you arrive at the studios of 
Black Widow Productions, where she is being held. Unfortunately, the whole studio is filled with 
monsters, as the horror movie sets have turned real. 
 
Elvira II: The Jaws of Cerberus is an adventure/RPG first-person game. You begin by choosing one of 
the four classes for your character (which determines your starting attributes, such as Strength, 
Intelligence etc.). 
 
For movement, you click the arrows in the bottom-right corner of the screen. Collecting items can be 
done via clicking on them in the first-person view window and dragging them into your inventory. (You 
can also click the "room" icon to see all the items that you've found in the room so far.) Should you 
encounter monsters, you fight by clicking on them. You can choose one of the four tactics (Normal, 
Defense, Fierce, Berserk) when fighting, and there's a number of different weapons you can find in 
the game. If you meet someone who doesn't want to murder you (a very rare occurrence) you can talk to 
him, though conversations are pretty simple and consist mainly of short phrases. 
 
As you defeat monsters, explore the game world and cast spells (see below), you get experience. Once 
you have enough experience, you gain a level, and your attributes improve. 
 
Thanks to Elvira's spellbook she gave you, you have the ability to create and cast spells. Some 
spells can be used to heal yourself, protect you in combat or damage your enemies, other are 
necessary to solve certain puzzles and make progress in the game. Creating a spell requires you to be 
of high enough level and to have the proper ingredients, different for every spell. The ingredients 
are usually gone forever once the spell is ready, so beware and don't use up any items vital for 
completing the game! Casting a spell requires you to use some amount of Power Points (PP), which 
regenerate automatically but slowly. What's more, you only get a limited number of castings when you 
prepare a spell, so don't waste them.

Empire (2496) (c) 1986 
 
The ultimate goal in Empire! is to build a great galactic empire protected by a huge frontier shield. 
Before this can be achieved however, players have to complete various missions, trade with starbases 
and fight off invading aliens. 
 
The ship is controlled from a top-down perspective, with four gauges indicating its energy level, 
temperature, radiation level and shield status. When the radiation level or temperature reach 
maximum, the ship is destroyed. The ship heats up when it's near a sun or firing weapons. The 
radiation level rises when radioactive pods are carried. When the ship is running out of fuel, it can 
be refueled by collecting ore from planets. Two direction finders at the bottom of the screen point 
towards the next starbase, mission objective or manually chosen target. 
 
At starbases, players can accept missions and trade minerals, ore or people. These three goods can be 
found on planets (in form of pods). In order to land on a planet, players must enter a warp hole. 
Once on the planet's surface, the game switches to first-person perspective and the player has to 
dodge or destroy rockets fired at the ship and follow the direction finders towards pods or the 
"exit". Starbases need to be supplied with materials to be able to produce "performance pods" and 
equipment for the ship. 
 
In order to reach other star systems, players have to fly through asteroid belts. Although some 
systems can only be reached with a special hyperspace pod. 
 
Many star systems are overrun by aliens and can only be reclaimed when all aliens are wiped out. 
There are also systems that are infected with the plaque and players must take care not to spread it 
to other systems. 
 
As the game progresses, more aliens, better equipment and new starbases appear. When all systems have 
been visited, players can buy starbases. When all systems are owned by the player, the game can be 
finished by constructing the frontier shield.

In this game you play the role of an endurance bike racer. The gameplay involves you racing against 
the clock to get to the finish line and jumping over ramps. At the end of each race you get points 
for how many cars or bikes you have overtaken with which you can upgrade your bike. 
There are various different terrain for you to race on including desert beach and dirt tracks plus a 
number of things to slow you down or even knock you off of your bike all together. The main idea is 
to find the best route through each level to shave off valuable seconds in order to over take more 
cars and bikes. 
 
The Japanese version of the game has more Tracks than the European and US versions have. Among  them 
is a snow track which is one of the hardest tracks in the game, because there is a lot of stones on 
the thin road.

Energy (Warrior) (2510) (c) 1988 Binary Design, Ltd. / Mastertronic Ltd. 
 
Its the year 2079, the earth is in sad shape as a result of neglect and chemical erosion. Its people 
have been decimated by plagues. The few remaining areas of natural beauty are very precious to those 
people who remain. You are the reserve warden, responsible for the maintenance of three of the 
biggest of these remaining areas, a forest, a set of oceanic islands and a rocky desert. The reserves 
are maintained by aura energy generators, buried deep below the ground. Unfortunately the Star Cygnis 
Alpha has gone supernova. One of the planets that had circled it was home to the Wavaren. Since their 
home was lost, they plan to live on your reserve. 
 
Each of the three regions are divided in ten areas. These areas are self contained and zoned off by 
force fields. They are kept pristine with their own power supply of aura energy. It is your job to 
clear all areas of aliens. Once an area is cleared of aliens, it will seal off and no other aliens 
will be able to enter it. If the aliens succeed in reducing the aura energy of an area to zero, then 
the area will die. If you let three areas die in any region, you will be terminated. 
 
The game provides a Status Control. At any time during the game you want to receive information on 
the other areas within a region, press the space bar and the game will pause allowing you to review 
the information on the display console. 
 
Patrol the areas in your J.O.S. fighter. Your fighter has powerful beam lasers that fire forwards and 
a limited number of blitz bombs that explode all aliens on the screen. But if your craft runs out of 
power, the game is over. Using your joystick, maneuver your fighter to chase down and destroy the 
enemy. Killing a slave robot will cause it to leave a bonus behind. The various bonuses are: more 
craft power, more area aura energy, blitz bombs, ext level and a mystery bonus. Some choices will be 
hard, grab a bonus to keep you alive or grab one to keep the region alive.

Enforcer - Fullmetal Megablaster (2512) (c) 1992 
 
Enforcer: Fullmetal Megablaster is a typical side-scrolling shooter. Maneuver your ship through 
several stages and destroy or dodge everything that gets in your way. Since the game is very fast and 
the number of enemies simultaneously on screen very high, your ship is not destroyed by a single 
collision, but has an energy bar. Shooting certain objects reveals different items and power-ups. 
These include: a spreadshot ,a laser, a secondary weapon that fires reflecting laser beams in four 
directions, smart bombs, health power-ups, shields and options. Options circle around your ship to 
offer protection and additional fire-power. Smart bombs damage or destroy everything on screen, while 
holding down the fire button will charge an especially powerful shot. At the end of each stage, the 
obligatory boss-battle awaits the player.

Humpty has become an engineer, and his job is to guide the spanner into the "works". When the player 
starts a level, the entire layout is shown which features conveyor belts and certain types of 
machinery, the latter which the player has to avoid. After a few seconds, it is replaced by large 
text and a small portion that shows the whereabouts of the spanner. As soon as the spanner is 
released from Humpty's grasp, it makes its way down the screen, the player can wiggle the joystick 
left or right to make the spanner in a different direction. The player loses one of their lives if 
the spanner makes contact with machinery or if it gets stuck on the edge of a conveyor belt. When the 
spanner is in the works, the game's border flashes and the player proceeds to the next level.

England Championship Special (2515) (c) 1991 Tiertex Ltd. / Grandslam Video Ltd. 
 
Featuring the English national squad in a top-down soccer game, England Championship Special 
represents British publisher Grand Slam's attempt to cash in on both England's respectable semi-final 
entry at the 1990 World Cup and the popularity of Anco's acclaimed Kick Off series. 
 
With its 1991 release, English Championship Special is somewhat awkwardly set in between the 1990 
World Cup (England made the semi finals, its best result since 1966, then lost to Germany and to 
Italy in the third-place match) and the European Championship of 1992, to which the "Championship 
Special" part of the title refers. The squad composition is based on the 1991 status quo, which means 
you'll go into the Euro tournament with World Cup veterans such as Waddle, Beardsley and Wright, but 
without 1992 players like Alan Shearer or Alan Smith, infamous substitute to Gary Lineker in the 
Sweden match. 
 
While Grand Slam got the England team and manager to officially endorse the game (thus having names 
and photos of 20 squad members from Robson to Gascoigne), they didn't buy the Euro Championship 
license. You'll be playing seven out of 22 European nations for the "Champions of Europe" title in a 
nondescript international tournament, from group matches to finals. 
 
Mimicking Kick Off in style and perspective, European Championship Special is geared towards 
high-speed play at bottom-level complexity, with only one action key for kicks and slides and heads. 
No cards and hardly any penalties, primitive AI and straightforward gameplay make for goals galore, 
and the weather system turns out to be wind velocities only, which turns out don't affect the ball at 
all.

Enlightenment - Druid II (2522) (c) 1987 Electralyte / Firebird Software Ltd. 
 
One hundred years after Hasrinaxx the Druid defeated the evil Acamantor, his nemesis is back, and 
although now older and having lost his Druid status after experimenting in black arts, he feels 
worthy of banishing this terrible foe. 
 
The gameplay uses a forced perspective top-down view, and strongly resembles Gauntlet in the way 
Hasrinaxx moves, shoots, avoids enemies and collects health items. 
 
Matters are more complex in terms of the spell system however. 32 spells can be collected and used, 
including a fireshield to allow you to pass fiery areas, water and fire walls to attack immediate 
enemies, a deathlight to clear the area of enemies, and a teleport. You can also summon one of 4 
Elemental beings, who can be controlled simultaneously to attack creatures for you. Only 8 spells can 
be carried at a time, but you can drop and later re-collect them.

shurikens which also must be avoided. A life is lost when the ninja has made contact with other

Entity (2527) (c) 1994 New Entry / CP Verlag 
 
Entity recreates a solitaire puzzle game originating in Victorian England. Played on a grid of 17 
squares, arranged as a pair of overlapping 3x3 diamonds. There are 8 white tiles and 8 black tiles, 
with a single space at all times. At the start, the space seperates the white tiles on the left from 
the black tiles on the right - the player's objective is to move the tiles so as to reverse this, 
leaving the black tiles on the left and the white tiles on the right. 
 
Tiles can be moved one space into the gap, or can jump directly over a tile to land in the gap. 
However, they must be at a right-angle to the space, not on an opposite corner. The all-time record 
is 46 moves

Sury Ani 7 has been a source of mined resources for many a year, but now that it is contaminated, the 
only way to harvest its bounty is to do so remotely. Worse still, the security system of defence 
droids is active, and primed to damage anything which attempts to penetrate the surface. 
 
As such, you are in control of a Dedicated Disposal Droid in, which must eventually shut down the 
security system and clear the area of radioactive material. This is done by throwing it down the 
disposal chute on each of the 8 levels, but you only have limited time before they explode. Fuel is 
limited and must be found within the complex, with the retro-thrust move using it up particularly 
quickly. To reach the next level you must find the appropriate pass.

Escape from Pulsar 7 (2555) (c) 1982 
 
Escape From Pulsar 7 is the fourth title in the Mysterious Adventure series of illustrated text 
adventures by Brian Howarth.  It has a science-fiction theme influenced by the hit film "Alien". The 
player finds themselves trapped alone on a giant space ship. The rest of the crew are dead, killed by 
a mutated zoo specimen. 
 
The player's goal is ultimately that they must escape the ship in a life pod to avoid being the 
creature's next meal. Explore the bunks of your comrades to find the tools needed. Only useful items 
can be taken, so the gameplay is quite linear, with several maze sections. 
 
These games used the Scott Adams adventure engine, and thus also have the same features - a basic 
2-word parser, small vocabulary, and brief descriptions. They were similar to other adventures of the 
time.

Eskimo Eddie (2567) (c) 1984 
 
Eskimo Eddie is an arcade adventure set in the Ice Age. The game is split into two levels. The first 
level varies between the Commodore 64 and ZX Spectrum versions. 
 
In the C64 version, Eddie must make his way toward Percy Penguin who has been captured by a polar 
bear named Growler. This can be done by navigating a series of platforms while jumping over snowballs 
Growler throws at him. Eddie only needs to rescue Percy once before he can move on to the next level. 
 
In the Spectrum version, the first level has Eddie collecting Percy, who is at the top of the screen, 
and bring him back to the bottom. He must deal with two Growlers who swim across the screen, and 
avoid jagged ice holes that slide all over the screen. Eddie must rescue Percy thrice before he moves 
on to the next level. 
 
In the second level, the entire screen is filled with ice blocks, which disappear one by one to form 
a maze. Percy appears in the middle of the maze. Four snowbugs also appear and start traveling around 
the maze, in an attempt to kill Percy. Percy needs to squash all snowbugs in the maze by pushing the 
ice blocks into them. The ice blocks can also be melted so that more space is created, allowing Percy 
to pass through. Any snowbug that touches the maze's electrified edges become dazed, allowing Percy 
to destroy them easily.

Eskimo Games takes the winter sports multi-event format and emphasises the winter rather than the 
sports. Operation Snowball is similar to the arcade game Cabal insofar as it resembles Operation Wolf 
but adds a roll manoeuvre. You must fire snowballs at people who are trying to make a catapult, and 
destroy the shots they aim at you. 
 
Eggsterminator places you at the top of a cliff, which has 5 ledges containing a bird’s nest. Birds 
will periodically land on these and lay eggs, which you must collect. Contact with the birds 
themselves causes you to fall and lose time. Ice N’Igloos involves using your axe to collect ice, and 
taking it to your incomplete igloo to complete it. Avoid the seals, as contact with these costs you 
time. 
 
Miami Ice is a clone of Tapper, except that instead of beer you are serving ice cream to people. From 
one side of the screen you must ensure that each line has enough ice creams sent down it to match the 
number of people coming. Also ensure that you are ready to collect the empty cones when these are 
returned. Evidently, the taste of wafers is not popular near the poles. 
 
The final event is not present on the C64. It is Barbearian, a one-on-one fight with a polar bear. 
The ice melting away sets the time limit in this game.

Crime is getting out of control in Liberty City, and to combat the problem, the LCPD establishes a 
new unit, called ESWAT (Enhanced Special Weapons and Tactics). Police officers who are promoted to 
this unit wear a cyber-suit that contains state-of-the-art military equipment including two 
Turbo-Booster Thrusters, extra ammunition, and increased protection. In order to become an ESWAT 
member, all a dedicated police officer has to do is arrest enough criminal masterminds to progress 
through the ranks, which include Captain, Assistant Chief, and Chief. 
 
ESWAT: Cyber Police is a horizontal-scrolling beat 'em up where you have to make your way from left 
to right and defeat a mastermind. There are 15 stages to complete, and have you patrolling through 
Liberty streets, car yards, stadiums, restaurants, the CBD, construction sites, and boat docks. While 
you're out on patrol, you can pick up ammunition, and the amount you get varies. For example, on some 
levels, ammo may be worth 10 bullets, while in others, you may get 60 bullets. Once you have obtained 
the cyber-suit, you wear it for the duration of the game.

Eureka! (2582) (c) Oct 31, 1984 Caesar Studio|Concept Marketing / Domark Group Ltd. 
 
Eureka! consists of a series of graphic adventure games set across various points in history. 
 
The game has you hunting for various pieces of an ancient talisman found on the Moon.  The talisman 
was subjected to intense beams of the SHIVA Fusion Project lasers and the talisman shattered under 
the beams and each of its corners vanished.  Three of the missing pieces were found several days 
later - one in Australia, one in Greenland, and the last in Outer Mongolia.  However, the other five 
pieces are still missing.  Noted physicist Dr. Abdul Majid discovers that teach piece was catapulted 
in time and the five missing pieces have been traced to Prehistoric Europe, Roman Italy, Arthurian 
Britain, Wartime Germany, and the Modern Caribbean. 
 
Each adventure is preceded by a short arcade game in which you could increase your 'vigour' level for 
the forthcoming adventure section by collecting flashing objects scattered about the level and 
returning them to one's base.  Your vigour level at any point in the adventure will determine whether 
not it is advisable to fight an opponent.  Combat occurs frequently in every adventure.  Sometimes 
you are attacked and must fight or run.  At others you may initiate the combat, if you feel

European 5-a-Side (2587) (c) 1988 
 
Five a side football is played indoors, in a walled arena which causes the ball to rebound at an 
angle when fired against it. This game gives you the chance to play this, either against a friend or 
the computer. The action is viewed top-down, with a slight angle giving a 3D effect, which is 
especially noticeable when the ball is in the air. You control the player nearest to the ball, 
including the goalkeeper once the ball reaches the 6-yard area, and can pass or shoot from any 
distance. The length of the match can be altered, as can the colour of the pitch.

European Football Champ (2589) (c) 1992 Taito Corporation / Domark Software Ltd. 
 
This conversion of a Taito arcade game was released to coincide with the 1992 European Championships. 
The game scrolls horizontally at a slight angle, and recreates the coin-op's close-up zoom effect 
after a player scores. Only a small area of the pitch is on screen at a time, but there is a scanner 
to show the whole pitch. 
 
Although the game has a referee, he often loses attention, and these moments give you a chance to 
foul, punch or side-swipe opposition players. One and two player options are included.

European Games (2590) (c) 1986 
 
Like so many other "Games" games, European Games is primarily a joystick-waggler, with some precision 
elements thrown in. Taking place over five or six disciplines, depending on platform, you generally 
go left to right (or hit the right keys) with your joystick on those judged on speed, while pressing 
the fire button once a metre reaches its top (as in golf games) is the general method for disciplines 
such as shooting. 
 
Throwing is handled by releasing your hammer when the power bar is at the top, with additional 
rotation control on the Commodore. 
 
Cycling* is pure joystick action from left to right to simulate pedal motions. 
 
Shooting* requires positioning of your man and then timing your trigger to the power (accuracy) bar. 
 
Swimming involves more joystick action, but you also need to keep an eye on your air supply. Going up 
for air slows you down, though. 
 
The long jump involves yet more joystick action, until you reach the touchboard. Then you need to 
press the jump button at the right time, optionally choosing jump angle. 
 
Rowing** is like swimming, but without air. 
 
Weight lifting involves more power bar pushing, keeping the bar high constantly and lifting the 
weight before the time runs out. 
 
*MSX only. 
**Commodore only.

Everest Ascent (2594) (c) 1984 Richard Shepherd Software / Richard Shepherd Software 
 
Everest Ascent is a strategy resource management game where the player is the leader of an expedition 
attempting to climb Mount Everest. With a limited starting fund of £1000, the player must juggle 
expenses to hire sherpas, purchase equipment that may be useful in the ascent (tents, ropes, planks) 
as well as rations to keep everyone fed. Able to set up various base camps on the way up, the 
progress of the player's expedition may also result in donations being given to the player to help 
his efforts (which the player can find out about if he pays out for a radio for the expedition). Of 
course, collecting such donations and gathering new supplies and sherpas will requite returning to 
village to collect them. Can you keep everyone alive and strong enough to reach the summit?

Evil Dead, The (2598) (c) 1984 Palace Software, LTD. / Palace Software, LTD. 
 
Based on the horror movie of the same name released a year earlier, here you take on the role of the 
films’ lead protagonist, Ash, and like the film, the game takes place in the isolated cabin deep in 
the woods, where upon a diabolical evil is set free. 
 
The games’ viewpoint is from the top-down over head perspective, where as you see  character’s head 
and shoulders only. The play-field consists of the cabin interior, which  is outlined in a kind of 
plan view, where doors are represented by a short white line which disappears and reappears upon 
opening and closing, and windows are represented by dotted lines which function in the same ways as 
the doors. Some details that are from the film, is the swing on the porch which is gently swaying in 
the wind, the fire place, which is ablaze, and the two old beds. 
 
The crux of the game-play is as follows, you take control of Ash, represented by a white figure, and 
you must try to keep out the Evil Dead shroud, which looks like a green cloud mass, that has the 
ability to open the various windows to get inside, and you must try to close the windows to stop it 
possessing your friends, Linda, Cheryl, Shelly or Scotty. When one is taken by the evil shroud, they 
will become a green mutant. 
 
Periodically, weapons will spawn and disappear about the house which Ash can utilise to fight the 
mutants. Weapons consist of hatchets, shovels, and swords, and can be used for a limited time. As you 
fight the various new additions to the evil dead, they will split into various body parts before 
being completely finished off, so you will have to contend with disembodied arms, and legs, ghost 
spirits, and such. You score points for each mutant, or evil body part dispatched. 
 
Ash’s health is expressed as a number, initially 10,000, and as you are attacked, and subsequently 
defend yourself, this number will proceed to diminish, and when it reaches zero, it is game over. The 
ultimate goal of the game is to score enough points to conjure up the book of the dead, and it will 
appear on the screen, and if you manage to collect it and throw it in the fire place, this is the way 
of concluding the game.

the amoeba stage where you need to eat all the DNA on the screen while avoiding the spores, microbes, 
and antibodies that are trying to stop you. The second level is the tadpole stage. The tadpole needs 
to eat three flies to move on to the next stage while avoiding the very hungry fish. Next is the 
rodent stage, where you need to eat five blocks of cheese while avoiding the snakes. In level four 
you need to guide a beaver across alligator infested waters to retrieve sticks and build a dam. The 
fifth level is the gorilla stage, where your gorilla has to use coconuts to fight off monkeys that 
are trying to steel its orange stash. And finally is the human stage, where you have to use a laser

to, and a separate combat engine where your party fought multiple monsters in a turn-based tile-based 
system. 
 
The story? After the defeat of the evil wizard Mondain and his mistress Minax in the previous two 
Ultimas, peace has returned to the land of Sorsaria. Times passes and eventually geological 
disruptions and a resurgence of the monster populace occur, and it is soon learned that Mondain and 
Minax had conceived a child named "Exodus" before their death. Now that child has become an adult 
with the power to avenge the death of his parents. Obviously, it falls upon you the hero to find and 
stop him.

This action game combines shoot 'em up and platform elements, as you control a flying man who can 
gain an exoskeletal suit for extra protection (hence the name). Your task is to progress from left to 
right in each level, either along the ground or by using the arrangement of platforms. Most of the 
baddies can be avoided rather than shot, and this is often easier, especially as you can duck or jump 
to avoid them. As well as a standard gun (activated by tapping fire) you also have a limited number 
of missiles to take out installations (activated by holding down fire, which makes autofire 
facilities useless). The scrolling is flick-screen, perhaps as the game was designed for the C64, and 
the Amiga version was identical to the ST's.

Expedition Amazon (2611) (c) 1984 
 
Expedition Amazon puts you in control of a team of 4 explorers on an expedition to map and study 
(i.e.: plunder) the ruins of the Incan civilization.  Your team consists of a Medic, a Field 
Assistant, a Radio Operator, and a Guard. After equipping your team with all the necessary supplies 
(don't forget the mosquito netting!) you travel to your base camp at the edge of the jungle where you 
will begin your journey. 
 
You will quickly meet up with many of the hazards of the jungle as you explore, including hostile 
natives (hope your Guard is a good shot!), mosquitoes, disease, covered pits, wildlife, and more. 
Each of your team members has an "EL" rating which indicates how close he is to dying. Death comes 
quickly for new team members, but as your team gains experience by mapping more and more of the 
Amazon and Incan ruins, your EL rating goes up and your team members become quite a bit more 
effective at avoiding hazards. You also get an Efficiency Rating "ER" which is an overall score of 
your exploration completed and loot collected minus your money spent and the number of team members 
killed. 
 
Once you have mapped a few sectors of jungle you will find some ruins with passages leading 
underground. Underground is a lot more hazardous than the jungle, as many of the pitfalls you 
encounter mean instant death if you don't have the proper equipment or your team was not alert. The 
natives are also a lot more numerous underground as well.  But don't worry, you can always replace 
members of your expedition. Besides, what does it matter if you lost your Field Assistant if the rest 
of your team is carrying out a bagful of gold and silver?

to avoid losing a life. Many of these shoot at you, so dodge their shots as you attack them. The game 
offers a practice mode, in which you have 32 lives to try to improve your skills, and a ‘normal’ mode 
in which you have unlimited continues as long as you can reach the high-score table with each 
continue – in this mode, as in the ‘advanced’ mode in which you must always start again from scratch, 
you have 5 lives

The Exterminator is essentially a clone of the arcade game Centipede. A centipede forms from the top 
of the screen and gradually moves down it, changing direction when striking the many barriers it 
hits. If it reaches the bottom of the screen, it wins. You control a small droid, which can move up 
the screen shooting out the centipede ,cutting it shorter each time).  You can also shoot the 
barriers, which take multiple hits to remove - the less barriers there are, the longer it will take 
for the centipede to reach the bottom. 
 
Occasionally a phoenix will appear, either moving horizontally towards the bottom of the screen, or 
vertically down from the top, to shoot for a points bonus or avoid. You have three lives, but on 
losing one you gain points for any remaining pieces of centipede. The high score is updated 
constantly once you pass it, and (unusually for the time) an attract mode demos the game.

F40 Pursuit (2638) (c) 1989 Titus France SA / Titus France SA 
 
You have discovered evidence that a rogue group of police officers are involved in a stolen car 
racket To stop them profiting form their dubious actions you must get across America as quickly as 
possible. This is made a little easier by the fact that your turbocharged Ferrari F40 can do over 300 
MPH. 
 
There are many forks in the road, with arrows at the top of the screen indicating which route is 
quicker. Any high-speed contact causes the car to blow up, but you have an infinite supply of these, 
and the only real penalty is the lost time. There are lots of road blocks to swerve around. The 
police are after you - pay attention to the sirens and stay out of their way.

it. The castle is guarded and full of trolls, who can weaken Isvar's energy - food and wine can

Falcon - The Renegade Lord (2653) (c) 1987 Virgin Games, Ltd. / Virgin Games, Ltd. 
 
When man first invented time travel, he did not realize the full extent of the dangers which world 
accompany it. To counteract these dangers, TIME was established to watch over the time-lines and the 
people who used them. 
 
Usually, TIME agents patrol the time-lines, making sure that no one interferes with events or alters 
the course of history. On this occasion, however, your mission is to track a renegade agent whose 
purpose is to causing disruptions in the space-time continuum, by patrolling the time-lines and 
switching artifacts between different zones. If left unchecked, these chronologically misplaced 
artifacts can cause massive disruptions through time, resulting in the large-scale destruction of the 
time zones, as well as having dire consequences for mankind. 
 
As a time lord, it is your responsibility to reverse the damage caused by the TIME agent and end his 
plans by finding and replacing the offending artifacts. For assistance, you have the use of a space 
craft known as the "Falcon's Wing". Partially controlled by CAIN (Cybernetic Artificially Intelligent 
Nexus), it performs different functions that include giving out information about the residents and 
artifacts to be found in the time zone, and notes any disturbances that have been detected. The ship 
is also used to travel to these time zones. You can leave the ship once you have arrived at the time 
zone. 
 
Equipped with laser gun and a jet pack, you explore the time zone while searching for any artifacts. 
When found, these can be picked up by walking over them and pressing the fire button. Only one 
artifact can be carried at any given time, so whatever it is you are carrying must be returned to the 
correct chronological period. 
 
In each time zone, you are constantly under attack by the inhabitants of that era, but the 
inhabitants can be destroyed with your laser gun. Extra powers can be gained by collecting tokens 
that randomly appear. There are two types of these. "Power of Will" immobilizes inhabitants for a few 
seconds, and "Thinkstrike" gives you temporary invisibility. 
 
You only have a limited amount of time in each zone. Your stamina decreases each time you get hit by 
an inhabitant, and when your stamina is severely depleted, you are returned to the Falcon's Wing and 
a time period is incurred. The mission ends when your stamina is reduced completely, or when the time 
limit for the mission has expired.

Based on the television series of the same name, The Fall Guy has the player controlling a stuntman 
who is trying to film scenes for an upcoming movie. There are five scenes as follows: 
 
Scene 1: The player must make their way across railway cars, avoiding birds that throw rocks down at 
them, and jump across stove pipes. 
 
Scene 2: This scene has the player jumping over ore cars while avoiding a person throwing stones at 
you from the tracks. 
 
Scene 3: No one in sight. All the player needs to do here is jump from boat to boat without falling 
off. 
 
Scene 4: The player must jump from one tank to the next, avoiding the missiles that are aimed at 
them. 
 
Scene 5: Similar to Scene 2, but only this time, the player needs to jump from crate to crate, which 
are loaded into an “Elite” truck. Getting the police hat awards points to them. 
 
If the player bumps into an obstacle or fall off whatever they are on, the player has to retake the 
shot. They have three takes per game. Also, as they roll the tape, the player uses up money and 
production costs, so the player cannot afford to make any mistakes. If the player manages to complete 
all five scenes, they move on to a more difficult level.

Farmer's Daughter, The (2675) (c) 1988 Nocturnal Software / Nocturnal Software 
 
The farmer's daughter is the eternal complement to the traveling salesman in American folklore and 
humour, practically Jungian archetypes licking their lips and circling each other warily while trying 
to figure out how to avoid the shotgun wedding neither party wants their hot-blooded fling to result 
in. 
 
Your car broken down near a farm in the middle of nowhere, now you are thrust into the joke and 
things are a lot less funny when it's your ass on the line.  Not only do you have to navigate around 
the ornery farmer and his itchy boomstick finger, but your travails are complicated by elements 
hitherto untapped in the shaggiest dog telling of the joke -- two inbred hick brothers straight out 
of Deliverance and a mean farm dog with an appetite for sausage.  All that plus you're working 
against the clock, the minutes ticking away until the garage comes to tow your vehicle and remove you 
from this den of the dangerous temptation you can't quite permit yourself to forego. 
 
Fortunately, the farm is full of nooks and crannies, well-stocked with all the objects you will need 
to use to distract or disable your obstructing antagonists... unfortunately, coordinating their 
movements will prove such a labyrinthine process that the game player is guaranteed to die a dozen 
deaths before eventually determining the convoluted route to this joke's eternal punchline.

Fast Tracks - The Computer Slot Car Construction Kit (2686) (c) 1986 
 
Fast Tracks is viewed from a forced overhead perspective, and loosely recreates slot car racing, also 
sharing its feel and some features with the much later Super Skidmarks. The secret is to knock the 
three rival cars off the circuit completely - this gives you a two-second time bonus, and sends that 
car back to the start of the lap. 
 
Seven circuits are built in, and more can be created using the supplied editor. They feature oil 
patches (causing the car to spin if you try to steer on them), bridges and underpasses, chicane and 
hairpin bends, and overlapping sections (collisions on these will usually knock both cars off).

Fax is a trivia game from Exidy. One or two players are asked multiple-choice questions that cover 
about four topics, including general knowledge, sports, history, and entertainment. There are more 
than 4800 questions and three difficulty levels. 
 
While players take the time to answer, two timers are shown. The timer at the top of the screen is 
shown as a bar and indicates the total time of the current round. The timer at the bottom of the 
screen consists of four digits, and indicates the score the player gets when they answer a question 
correctly. If this timer reaches zero, the player receives no score and the game moves on to the next 
question. The round ends when the top timer is empty. 
 
Depending on whether the player has enabled it, a cartoon is shown regardless of a correct or 
incorrect answer. This cartoon shows a person receiving either a dunce cap or graduation hat.

Fearless Fred owns a factory comprising of 16 rooms. His job is to collect parts that are found lying 
on the ground within a strict time limit. There is only one problem. Each room is infested with 
robots and other dangers, and Fred has no weapon he can use against them. The only thing he can do is 
jump over them. If he makes any contact with them, Fred becomes electrocuted and he loses one of his 
life. A built-in cheat allows the player controlling Fred to move up or down a room, but by doing 
this, the player is unable to enter the top three.

Felix in the Factory (2696) (c) 1984 
 
Players control Felix, a factory worker who must ensure that his generator does not run out of oil. 
The oil can be found somewhere within the factory. But before he can reach it, Felix must first cross 
by jumping over parcels that move the conveyor belt. If he touches any of the parcels, he falls down 
and is carried along the belt until he reaches the end. If he has time to stand up, he can continue 
on as normal but if he reaches the end of the belt, he loses a life. 
 
Then, Felix has to navigate a series of platforms which are populated by enemy gremlins. Felix has to 
overcome these gremlins by getting out of their way or using a pitchfork to destroy them. 
Occasionally, a giant rat runs across the screen, and Felix can deal with it by laying down some rat 
poison. If he comes into contact with either a gremlin or the rat, Felix falls off the platform and 
loses a life. 
 
Once the oil is collected, Felix must return to the generator so that it can be refilled. If the 
generator runs out of oil, the game ends regardless of how many lives the player has.

Fernandez is a despot who has invaded the Republic of El Diablo, bringing terror to the local people. 
The rightful leaders of the country have called you in to destroy Fernandez's hideouts and bring his 
country back to the people. 
 
Fundamentally this is a Commando clone, scrolling vertically and with hordes of enemies to be taken 
on, with finding good shielding spots and launching surprise attacks an especially useful 
strategy.You have unlimited bullets and limited but collectible grenades to use. There are landmines 
to avoid, and medical packs to pick up. 
 
On each of the 8 levels you must destroy Fernandez's buildings, which are accessed through an 
underground network of tunnels. You're not limited to being on foot - you start off in a jeep and can 
also use motorbikes, tanks and similar, although losing a life destroys this. In 2-player mode you 
can split driving and gunning duties. When starting a new game, you always start from the point at

Fifth Quadrant, The (2712) (c) 1987 Bubble Bus Software / Bubble Bus Software 
 
After 20 years in space, the Orion has finally accomplished its task of galaxy mapping. Only one 
small nebula remains, but while making the intergalactic jump, the Orion is taken over by an alien 
race known as the Zimen. 
 
In an attempt to get rid of the Zimen, the players control four robots - Captain Slog, Plot the 
Navigator, Engineer Knut, and Able Spaceman Bodd - which they use one at a time. Each robot is 
situated in different areas of the ship. Some robots can easily navigate their way through the maze 
of 230 rooms, while others are temporarily trapped in their rooms. 
 
When a robot comes into contact with the Zimen, its energy is quickly drained. When all of its energy 
is depleted, the robot will stop functioning, and the only way it can be restored is if a passing 
robot transfers its energy with the non-functional one. 
 
The Zimen materializes suddenly in the Orion's passageways with deadly persistance, and can easily 
trap the outnumbered crew into a corner. To help them, the robots can throw bouncing bombs at the 
Zimen, gaining points when they have been destroyed. 
 
Control panels scattered throughout the ship give a robot access to code screens. When decoded, these 
will unlock matter-transmitters and lifts, meaning that the robot crew can move through the ship and 
closer to the ultimate goal: locking into the Bridge Computer. When all four have done this, the 
Orion will be safe.

Final Blow is an action game based around the sport of boxing. You can play the fighters in a

last one minute, with a short break in between them. As in the real sport, your aim is to knock your 
opponent down for 10 seconds, by gradually weakening him with a series of punches. You can block 
punches, to avoid them inflicting damage onto you. The ring is of a limited size, so players can be 
cornered, although the referee will intervene to break the boxers up if they become entangled in a 
stalemate position. 
 
The genesis version is not to be confused with the Master System game of the same name, which is

You control an ant that must rescue the queen ant taken hostage by a group of scorpions. She is being 
held in the eighth chamber, but to reach her, you must navigate a series of tunnels that are being 
patrolled by the scorpions, and use objects scattered throughout the chambers to proceed to the next 
one. These objects include getting keys that will open yellow doors, and explosives that will 
detonate walls. Objects placed at the proper locations usually cause a chain reaction that clears the 
obstacles. Occasionally, scorpions are seen laying eggs, and getting these eggs will award you with 
bonus points. When the queen ant is rescued, the game resets to the first chamber.

Firefly (2761) (c) 1988 Special FX Software Ltd. / Ocean Software Ltd. 
 
In the game, you, as commander of the Firefly, must destroy the 'mechanoid system framework' that 
your enemy has created by destroying its energy source. 
 
The framework is represented as a grid of squares or sectors.  Ultimately you must reach and destroy 
the power source, at the far right of the grid, whilst at the start of the game you only have access 
to the 'dead zone', at the far left of the grid, and those squares immediately adjacent.  This can be 
extended as described below. 
 
Planetary sectors are systems with planets in them, and cannot be entered as they are the enemy's 
main colonies, so are too well defended.  Thus they block the path. 
 
Unconstructed regions can be taken over, turning them into part of the dead zone, by bypassing the 
'instrusion detection' alarm system.  The system involves the cursor flicking between 'thumbs up' and 
'thumbs down' symbols, and you must press fire when 'thumbs up' is displayed to take over the system. 
 A thumbs down will scramble the squares on the grid. 
 
The main part of the game takes place when you try to take over an occupied zone.  Here the game is a 
shoot-em-up, where you can move freely in two dimensions, and shoot at your enemies.  Your ammunition 
orbits you, and when fired takes a moment to come back to you, so you can temporarily run out of ammo 
if you fire too quickly.  . 
 
In an occupied zone there are 4 energy points that you must destroy.  To destroy an energy source you 
must collect 4 zokas, or excess energy units from it, then enter, and select a thumbs up as  the 
cursor alternates between it and a thumbs down.  The cursor alternates more quickly in successive 
energy points. 
 
Teleports can be used, to move between areas, but when you attempt to use one, your ship rotates 
whilst pointing at a set of alternating green and red dots in a circle.  You must hit the fire button 
3 times in succession, when the ship is pointing at a green dot, with the ship spinning faster each 
time. 
 
If you take too much damage your ship explodes, and you lose a life, and re-enter the grid, with the 
occupied zone still occupied.  However, if you successfully destroy all 4 energy points, the occupied 
zone becomes part of the dead zone as you re-enter the grid.

First Samurai (2774) (c) 1992 Vivid Image / Image Works 
 
"The Demon King descends from his mountain domain to you, the First Samurai and your master. 
Defenceless against the Demon's magic, you succumb to his powers, leaving the your Master to fight 
the Demon King alone. Your master falls in combat, dying. But, with his last breath, he summons the 
Wizard Mage. The Demon King fearing defeat, escapes to the future. Tormented, the young samurai seeks 
the teachings of the Wizard Mage in the ways of magic. Boiled with revenge and armed with a magical 
sword, the young samurai follows the Demon King into the future and the unknown..." 
 
The First Samurai is a platform action game very much similar to other platform games, but with a 
medieval oriental touch to it in addition to various unique features. 
 
Arriving in the new unknown land, you are defenceless hence your fists and kicks. But as you journey 
forth, you'll find your trusty magical sword as well as throwing weapons such as knives and axes. 
With your martial art skills, your enemy best beware with those sudden moves that may prove fatal! 
 
The First Samurai offers a wide array of weapons, special items and other objects. Combat is usually 
melee, either relying on your punch or kicks or using the magical sword to slash some pretty skillful 
blows in whatever direction possible. 
 
Monsters are forever regenerating but food for health is plentiful. It actually takes an effort to be 
killed...

Fist II - The Legend Continues (2782) (c) 1986 Beam Software Pty., Ltd. / Melbourne House 
 
The Way of the Exploding Fist is a martial arts doctrine ensuring that you possess a range of 
powerful punches, uppercuts, roundhouse kicks and flying kicks. As an evil warlord has enslaved your 
people, courtesy of his many henchmen and mercenaries, you will need them as you journey to his 
mountainous hideout to destroy him. 
 
The game is no longer a single screen sequence of Yie Ar Kung Fu style duels, but is more influenced 
by Renegade, although with strict martial arts moves. However, a combat practice program is also 
provided, which plays much more similarly to the original game. The action takes place on different 
levels, which are reached by traversing ladders. There are many doorways to walk through, which cause 
a switch in the usually-scrolling display.

Flight Simulator II (2810) (c) 1984 subLOGIC / subLOGIC 
 
If there were any doubt as to the quality of Flight Simulator II, it should be dispelled by the 
knowledge that SubLOGIC went to the FAA for approval of its use in flight training.  Whether or not 
they actually got the approval—remember this was 1984, and such application of personal computers was 
new ground—they attempted to create a realistic flight simulator. 
 
This flight simulator simulates a real aircraft, the Piper PA-23-181 Archer II.  For those with the 
knowledge, it offers practice with the variables of flight, including the avionics. The Atari 
ST-release (1986), instead, simulates the Cessna 182 single engine propeller aircraft and the Gates 
Learjet 25G twin engine jet. 
 
The simulator was considered to be a second generation product.  It had many more features than first 
generation flight simulators, and pilots were expected to pay attention to small details.  SubLOGIC 
encouraged the users of the game to go to flight stores and purchase flight-training manuals and 
aeronautical charts to help them understand the variables within the program.  The game was oriented 
toward pilots-in-training, but there were options for non pilots too: the company included an easy 
mode, and a slightly more detailed reality mode.  These modes did not require the same level of 
knowledge. 
 
Flight Simulator II was also packaged with a WWI dogfighting game, called WWI Ace.  In this game your 
plane is armed with bombs, machine guns, and a radar screen.  The radar screen is anachronistic for a 
game set in World War I, but it is there to help gameplay.

The Flintstones is a game based on the popular cartoon series The Flintstones by Hanna-Barbera 
Productions Inc. 
 
It's weekend! Fred Flintstone thinks of only one thing: bowling 
with his friend and neighbor Barney. 
Unfortunately, his wife Wilma got other plans for him. Fred has to paint the living room and Wilma is 
not going to help him with it. No, she goes shopping. 
And if that's not enough, Wilma also tells Fred that his mother-in-law is coming over. 
 
The Flintstones game is divided in four parts. 
 
Part 1: Painting the walls of your living room. 
To go to the bowling alley before it is closed Fred has to paint  the walls as quickly as possible. 
To paint the walls Fred uses the tail of a living squirrel. 
Pebbles tries to leap out her playpen and starts crawling around and starts scribbling on the walls. 
If Fred wants to put Pebbles back in the playpen then he has to drop the squirrel, that immediately 
starts wandering off. When Pebbles is back in the playpen Fred has to chase the squirrel and dip its 
tail in the paint again. 
 
Part 2: Driving your car on the way to the bowling center. 
Finally, when all walls are painted Fred can go to the bowling 
alley! 
Fred has to drive to the bowling alley but unfortunately the roads are in a very bad condition. The 
road surface is dire and covered with rocks! 
And if one of the wheels hit a bump it will break off the car and disappear into the distance. 
 
Part 3: A bowling competition between Fred and Barney. 
At the bowling alley the following bowling parameters can be set: the spin and speed of the ball and 
the starting position of the player. 
Each turn gives two throws (except he gets a strike). A game 
takes ten turns. while a match takes three games. 
 
Part 4: Saving Pebbles at a construction site. 
On his way home Fred discovers that Pebbles has disappeared!  Don't let Wilma find that out! 
Fred finds Pebbles at a construction site on top of some 
scaffolding. He has to climb the scaffolding to rescue her. 
If Fred fails to rescue his daughter then Barney rescues her and Fred will be branded as a failure!

also hire a youth team for the chance of uncovering a rough diamond. Each week there are up to 2 
players available to sign, who are (like your own players) rated out of 10 for form - players with 
more than 5 will rarely want to play in division 4. Matches are played outside your view, with a 
minute-by-minute update, and all the other results afterwards.

You start with 10 'goal cards' - up to 3 can be played in each match, each of them giving you a 
shooting chance, at which point arcade action skill comes in. The better you perform, the higher your 
wages are, the more chance you have of a big-money transfer and international call-up, and the less 
chance you have of being dropped from the team. 
 
There's also a trivia section, which asks increasingly difficult questions allowing you to go double 
or nothing on knowing the answers - up to £8000 a time can be won on this.

Football Manager II (2854) (c) Jun, 1988 Addictive Games Ltd / Addictive Games Ltd 
 
Football Manager from Addictive was the first game of its kind, and this sequel followed several 
years later, absorbing ideas from the many similar games released in between. Teams can now choose 
formations, and assign man-to-man marking. Players have individual skills and fitness ratings, in a 
more realistic way, with half-time substitutions and tactical changes supported. The whole 92-club 
league is incorporated, as is the League Cup alongside the FA Cup. It is now possible to watch and 
assess the individual performance of the players, with match graphics differentiating the attack / 
midfield / defense areas more clearly. Training allows passing length and height to be specified.

Force Seven (2867) (c) 1987 Datasoft, Inc. / Datasoft, Inc. 
 
In Force Seven, the player is in charge of a specially trained squadron which consists of seven crew 
members, all with different expertise. Their task is to infiltrate the energy production plant on the 
planet KARIS by rescuing any survivors and destroying any aliens that are holding them captive. 
 
The player is equipped with a flame thrower which they can use to destroy the aliens, but caution 
must be taken so that they do not destroy survivors by accident. If the player spends too much time 
in a room, a green alien appears in their exact location. It is invincible to shots, so the player 
needs to get away as soon as possible. If the player comes into contact with any aliens, their energy 
is depleted. When the player has no energy left, the crew member they are controlling dies, requiring 
them to select another member. 
 
Also in each room are supplies, and the player can stock up on more ammo, grenades, or health if 
required. Teleports around the facility warp the player to a room with a blueprint reader. Using this 
lets players either travel between the plant's six floors or to another area within the same floor.

Formula 1 3D - F.1 Manager II (2634) (c) 1991 Simulmondo / Simulmondo 
 
The second version of F.1 Manager is an improved installment with two languages support 
(English/Italian), additional graphics and features, but much of the code of its predecessor was 
reused. 
 
In this game the player manages a Formula 1 team, starting with a certain budget of $6,000,000. The 
gameplay includes the economical and technical management, simulation of qualification driving of 
Formula 1 car on the famous circuits, and management of the pilot's actions during the race. 
 
In adjustment phase you should select one of rookie or profi racers from around the world (such 
legends as A. Senna, A. Prost, or N. Mansell, etc. are present) to enlist and select one of the cars 
to buy. The enlistment bonus price of racers differs based on their position and skills described by 
three parameters: Courage, Ability, Tactics. The price of car differs based on its parts selected and 
adjusted. Starting with the rookie pilots you will eventually progress to a professionals. 
 
In simulation phase you should accelerate/decelerate the car, shift the gears, correctly go into 
bends, and finish the lap as fast as possible to get a better starting position. 
 
In management phase you should keep an eye on the race progress and messages from the commentator, 
give guidelines to the pilot on when to accelerate/decelerate, examine the car's state, and win the 
race to earn the points and prize. 
 
'Single track' and 'Championship' modes are allowed as well as gameplay for 1-2 players. In 2 players

Fort Apocalypse (2877) (c) 1982 Synapse Software Corporation / Synapse Software Corporation 
 
The war with the Kralthans is on, and they've taken prisoners. These people must be rescued from the 
Draconis caves and the Crystaline caves that are located just outside the Kralthan main command 
center, Fort Apocalypse. The Fort is too powerful to attack directly, but perhaps a single rocket 
copter, carefully controlled might be able to do what an army cannot. However the caves are narrow 
and the enemy has still setup impact shields, defenses and Hyper-Chambers within their depths. 
 
Fort Apocalypse is a 4-way side-scrolling game, somewhat similar to Choplifter. The player takes the 
seat of a "rocket copter" and can move up, down, as well as left and right. However this helicopter 
takes time to turn between left and right perspectives, facing the "front" of the screen. While 
facing the front, the player is able to drop powerful plasma bombs which can destroy heavy weapons 
and doors. When facing directly left or right, the weapon used is a more maneuverable but weaker 
interceptor rocket. Displayed on the screen is a "Navatron", which functions as a radar showing 
terrain and enemies not yet on the map. Prisoners, once found can be landed on top of them in order 
to rescue them. There are also "Hyper-Chambers", which are glowing teleporters to other Hyper 
Chambers located on the same level. Fuel is constantly consumed while flying, but can be recharged at 
Fuel depots scattered throughout the level. There are also separate Landing Pads which will be the 
point at which a new helicopter is given to the player, should they be defeated in battle. 
 
 
Enemies include laser beams, teleporting rocks, breakable walls, self-propelled mines (SPM), armored 
tanks (which can only be destroyed from their treads), alien droids and hostile robo-choppers.

Fourth Protocol, The (2891) (c) Aug 01, 1985 Electronic Pencil Co. Ltd., The / Hutchinson Computer 
Publishing 
 
This interactive fiction computer game is based on the bestselling Cold War spy novel by Frederick 
Forsyth released in 1984 by Hutchinson publishing.  As the novel's hero John Preston, you have been 
appointed head of the C1(A), an agency of the British Secret Intelligence Service. You uncover a 
plot, named AURORA, to take power in the Soviet Union hatched by a secret faction of high-level 
minds.  In order to stop their plan you read a lot of info found in Top Secret folders, set wiretaps, 
monitor and interrogate suspects and informants, and gather facts and clues. 
 
The game has three main sections - The NATO Documents, The Bomb and The SAS Assault. A secret code 
must be gained in order to proceed from one to the next. Unique icon-based graphics provide the means 
to conduct your investigation though they're not mouse-clickable (you have to browse the icons using 
the space bar).  Interesting plot twists and developments happen during the game and are communicated 
to you with text-only descriptions.

for revenge. 
 
You'll be foraging both above and below ground, with rabbits and hens on offer to kill, and apples 
and milk (yes, I know foxes are purely carnivorous) can be collected. All of this must be brought 
back to the home before to complete each level. All manner of nasties are thrown at you, including 
eggs (from hens), nuts (from squirrels) and rocks (from badgers)

Frank Bruno's Boxing (2901) (c) 1985 Elite Systems Ltd. / Elite Systems Ltd. 
 
Former boxing World Champion Frank Bruno, famed for his catchphrase "you know what I mean, Harry?" 
and more recently his heroic battle with depression, put his name  to this boxing game which 
replicates Punch-Out. As Frank, you must take on 8 progressively tough boxers to win the title. 
 
The action is viewed from right behind Frank in 3D, meaning that you can see and feel the full impact 
of punches. A full range of moves is provided, with the standard jabs complimented by body punches 
and the ability to dodge, duck or raise your guard. 
 
Each punch weakens your opponent's strength, although going long enough without being hit can see 
this begin to recover. A rain of blows can produce a quick knockout, but in general you must hit him 
many times, and then with a knockout blow, to see him go down.

As the last living descendant of the storied Frankenstein family, the player has been summoned to the 
old family estate.  In the creepy manor, the player is charged (through messages in envelopes) by no 
less than the great doctor Victor Frankenstein with a crucial task -- reanimating the monster (in the 
basement lab) who plunged the family name into infamy. 
 
This will involve gathering critical components from around the lot, from electrodes (nothing less 
than golden ones will do!) to some fresh(ish) human organs.  Crack a safe, navigate a secret massage, 
thwart the depredations of a local wolfman, and then just as electricity arcs across the long-disused 
capacitors and the creature stirs once more, watch things go awry just at the greatest moment of 
Promethean triumph!

Playing a thoroughly drab, mundane and predictable character, your aim is to become interesting

You explore the streets and houses in the search of a way out. The main basis of the game involves 
picking up objects and using them in the correct way - most objects have more than one potential use, 
and misusing them is the only way the game can be lost. There are several sub-games along the way, 
including shoot 'em ups, a maze and a jigsaw puzzle.

Your mission is to survive long enough to wake up. For every room you visit, another 6 minutes goes 
by, and at 8:12 the alarm clock will ring, and save your life. 
 
Your secondary objective is to increase your dream-state. You start with a "bad dream", but by 
killing monsters, and collecting chalices, you can get much worse dreams, like "horrible dream" or 
"deadly vision". Your dream-state is displayed in text-form at the top of the screen, and does not 
affect the game in any other way. 
 
This is a horror game, and you will face zombies, bats, ghosts, and other terrifying creatures. If 
they touch you, you lose one of your five lives. You can collect different items, like guns, 
crucifixes, clocks, and other stuff. Your inventory can hold up to three items at once. 
 
You can kill some enemies with the gun, but many are immune to it. Crucifixes can freeze enemies, and 
clocks slows them down. 
 
The game consists of a huge maze of interconnected rooms. It's easy to get lost, and the game is 
almost impossible to complete, even if you cheat. So this is for anyone who wants a big challenge.

Your task in this arcade conversion is to guide a frog across a treacherous road and river, and to 
safety at the top of the screen. Both these sections are fraught with a variety of hazards, each of 
which will kill the frog and cost you a life if contact is made. 
 
The road is full of cars and trucks, at variable speeds. The river water itself is fatal, as are the 
snakes which hover within on later levels. Frogger must use the arrangement of logs, turtles (which 
are only there for a short time) and alligators (but stay away form their faces), and then jump into 
one of the open home-cells, ideally one containing a fly for extra points. Once all holes have been 
filled, you move onto the next, harder, level.

In Frost Byte you control Hickey the Kreezer, an elastic curve which moves sideways, jumps and 
shoots. You must navigate your way through planet Cosmica, and rescue your brethren, within the 
limited 'Twang' energy you have. 
 
Cosmica is full of hideous monsters, many of which can be shot. Your character builds momentum as it 
moves, so some hazards are easier to clear from a running start. You can only jump vertically, 
although you have control as the character falls. Ammunition is limited, and must be collected 
throughout your quest. 
 
Three sweets which enhance your character can be collected - the red one increases your speed, blue 
increases the height of your leap, and green means you can safely fall further. There are additional 
objects to pick up and use as well.

These six small educational games star Freddy the Frog. Each uses simple controls to ensure that 
children can play without difficulty from the software. 
 
Using forward, back, left and right keys Freddy must get to various important buildings as depicted 
on the screen. In Adding he is presented with a network of lily pads, some of which contain numbers 
or mathematical symbols. Land on these in the correct order to produce a correct sum. In the Toyshop, 
first identify toys from their names, then choose a toy at a specified price, and then combine goods 
to meet a specified price limit. 
 
Electricity allows you to learn about circuits - by working out whether an existing layout will work, 
and modifying it so that it will. The next game involves telling the time, so as to get the prince 
his key. Funtext teaches information searching using a Ceefax-type environment.

A friendly teddy bear is on hand to help teach the skills children should have on starting school. 
They are controlled using the space and return keys, so young children should be able to play with 
little support. Most games have multiple difficulty levels, which reveal themselves after the easiest 
has been solved. 
 
If Teddy's friend is to climb the tree successfully, you must recognise which of the items in front 
of you can be paired up. Initially there are 6, rising to 18 as you get them right. The Gallery game 
involves matching pictures with the correct label, with more and more options as the game difficulty 
increases. In the actions game you must choose an action word and watch Teddy act it out. 
 
To help teddy get up the steps to his beloved honey, you must correctly count the numbers of everyday 
objects such as teddies, trees and clouds on a screen. The Letters game takes place at the fair - 
matching the letters displayed will earn your Teddy an ice cream. Parents may wish to offer the same 
reward to their children, but should watch out for E numbers. The colouring module is less a game and 
more an experiment in design - choose the colours of each item to form a picture.

primarily use the cursor keys and enter. 
 
Freddie is building a house, but can only add a log to his work if you solve a maths question. In the 
library, a list of book titles must be sorted into alphabetical order. 
 
Successfully ordering letter and number sequences on the basketball court results in shots going in. 
Knowing which word is the opposite of the displayed one will help Freddy's diving. 
 
In the shop you have to identify which coins pay for which items, and then total up a shopping load 
and work out which coins pay for it. There is also a simple typing test included.

One of the first future sport simulations, Future Games involves five tough events on the surface of 
the moon. After each event, you have to drive to the next one across potentially hostile terrain 
using your skimmer. 
 
The first event involves dodging through the defenses of a hostile computer system, with on-screen 
arrows guiding your route. The second is a super-charged game of dodge-ball – avoiding plasma spheres 
that are being fired at you, while the third involves shooting at everything from a target range. The 
fourth event entails destroying atomic badgers, while the final one involves running away (read 
‘joystick-waggling’) from a hungry beast.

In this game, players have to launch a spaceship from a vessel that moves left and right repeatedly 
until the fire button is pressed. After the ship is released, it must be guided through a field of 
orbs (that also move left and right) to one of the four pads at the bottom of the screen. While 
avoiding the orbs, the ship can be slowed down by releasing fuel so it makes navigating to the pads 
easier. The pads each consist of three layers, and a layer is removed when the player's ship lands on 
it and a small blue alien enters it. Once done, the player needs to guide the alien back to the 
vessel. The invaders will get released from the orbs, but the player can shoot them with a bullet.

Ten power flowers have been stolen and hidden in a set of caves. As the gardener in charge, it is the

Players take control of the gardener, who sits in a flying chair, and must guide him through the mazy 
caves which are seen from a side-scrolling perspective. Colliding with the walls of the cave or one 
of the various obstacles, such as moving gates and force-fields, or patrolling snapdragons costs a 
life. Before one of the power flowers can be picked up, a pot has to be collected. Touching a power 
flower without carrying an empty pot also costs a life. The chair uses up fuel, but can be refuelled 
by picking up the right power ups. Teleporter can be dropped throughout the levels and mark points to 
which the gardener returns after losing a life. Beans can be picked up to gain extra and there is 
also a spray that temporarily stuns snapdragons.

While you are shooting down ships, you also have the opportunity to shoot down the queen ship when it

capture enemy ships, and make them work for you, therefore giving you double the firepower.

enemy ship appears before all the groups disappear. For each ship destroyed, you will form a letter

This strategic action puzzle game features original gameplay. You control a spacecraft situated on a 
globe which you can rotate and move around the screen. You must knock globes into others of the same 
colour, to rid the screen of all the globes. The screen has no borders, so globes can be pushed off 
the side of the screen, increasing your tactical range. Knocking globes of different colors into each 
other produces smaller pods which need to be picked up quickly, giving you energy, or they will turn 
into globes and you will have to get rid of them too. Many of the globes are linked to other globes 
(or the ship) via string, and the level layouts include barriers as obstacles (and ricochet points), 
making the Newtonian physics more complex.

Gamma Force - The Pit of a Thousand Screams (3057) (c) 1988 Tom Snyder Productions, Inc. / Infocom, 
Inc. 
 
In a dangerous world, individual superheroes are not enough. Even the best of them - a humanoid made 
of flame, an elf princess with a mean bow, and a musclebound waterbeast - can't do it all themselves. 
When they come together, they are Gamma Force. Can anybody stop them? 
 
This was one of the first interactive comic books (along with Lane Mastodon and ZorkQuest.) 
 
The unique element of this software was you could "follow" the narrative from a single character's 
point of view, or "jump" to another character's.  Thus, you could re-read the story to learn new 
things about how the character's different paths affected each other and the outcome of the story. 
The display technology used a 3D vector format

Gangbusters is a turn-based, text-based Gangster simulator requiring at least two players.  Beginning 
with the start of prohibition and ending when one player becomes the Godfather (or when the Feds get 
too wise to the situation), Gangbusters takes the players through the life of crime: extortion, 
gambling, pay-offs, taking out contracts, serving time, and spending money.  Each player completes 
their turn (one year gametime) by issuing orders on several screens, deciding how to invest money, 
and then reading summary reports at the end to see how well you've done.  Random events, like Fed 
crack downs, could mean you spend some time in jail, dropping big bucks at the racetrack attracts 
positive and negative attention, stealing limos puts your neck on the line, and hitmen are always one 
phone call away.

Garfield - Big, Fat, Hairy Deal (3068) (c) 1988 Softek / Edge, The 
 
In the earliest licensed entertainment videogame of Jim Davis' lazy cat cartoon character, you play 
Garfield in his attempt to rescue Arlene from the cat pound. The primary gameplay involves object 
manipulation, gaining objects either by picking up or receiving them from other characters (usually 
in exchange for other objects). 
 
Most characters from the cartoons play a part in the game. Odie the dog follows you around - swipe 
him for points. Garfield's cousin Nermal can help you out. They can also carry objects for Garfield's 
use. 
 
Garfield needs regular food and rest - without one of these he falls asleep and it is Game Over. 
Contact with many foes is draining. A butcher's is one major food source.

Garfield - Winter's Tail (3069) (c) 1989 Softek / Edge, The 
 
After a fruitful day spent on his favorite hobby (food, what else?), Garfield the cat falls asleep 
next to Jon's still open fridge. The chill coming out of the refrigerator induces a dream of the 
Swiss Alps, with Garfield going after the largest lasagna factory in the world and a mythical chicken 
that can lay chocolate eggs. It is the player's goal to make sure Garfield's dream comes to a happy 
ending before he wakes up. 
 
Garfield: Winter's Tail comprises of three different mini-games.The first one has Garfield skiing 
downhill towards a ski-jump that will lead him straight to the rooftop of the lasagna factory. The 
second mini-game is set in the chocolate factory where the mythical chicken is employed: Garfield 
must ensure all the mechanical chickens in the factory are provided their chocolate supply flowing 
through a pipeline. Finally, he must ice-skate across a frozen lake, following the trail of chocolate 
footsteps left by the chicken. 
 
As a disturbing element, Odie appears throughout the whole game. The drooling dog can steal some of 
the food Garfield needs to replenish his energy, but he can also tamper with the lift controls in the 
factory and saw holes in the frozen lake. 
 
The three mini-games can be played in any order. However, playing the whole game from the skiing 
level first is the only way to be able to see the ending.

Garrison (3070) (c) 1988 Digital Dreams / Rainbow Arts Software GmbH 
 
Top-down action adventure/puzzle game very similar to Gauntlet. 
Up to five characters fight their way through over 100 dungeon levels taking on hordes of enemies, 
collecting potions, gold, scrolls, keys and magic items along the way. 
Each player character has different strengths and weaknesses 
so the game plays best in multiplayer mode because some levels really benefit from particular 
capabilities eg. speed or magic. The enemies also have a large variety of attacks, some fire 
projectiles at you, some engage you in hand to hand combat, some just drain your health when they 
touch you and some attack you with magic.

Gates of Dawn (3075) (c) 1985 Virgin Games, Ltd. / Virgin Games, Ltd. 
 
The player controls a knight who must discover the mystery of the mind. To do this, four objects must 
be collected - iron, stone, fire, and ice - so that they can pass through the Gates of Dawn. These 
objects are scattered in the maze. The maze consists of 64 rooms, which are displayed in a 3D view 
with the walls bearing garnish patterns and colors, giving them a psychedelic look. The rooms are 
usually filled with monsters. 
 
As the player navigates between rooms, a map in the top-right of the screen charts their progress. An 
arrow below it indicates the direction they are facing, and it is up to the player to keep an eye on 
this arrow later on in the game. 
 
Players start the game with five lives, a strength of 10,000, and a sword. The player either loses 
strength or one of their lives when they touch certain monsters. The game ends if the player loses 
all their lives or strength. 
 
The sword can be used to destroy monsters, as long as it is at the top of the inventory. The 
inventory can only hold up to five items, with the item being held at the top. Said object can be 
examined, dropped, or used. Pressing the relevant key will present the player with a list of 
available commands. "Examine" gives a small description of the object being held. "Drop" allows the 
player to drop the selected object, and "Use" allows them to perform an action with the currently 
held object by typing in an action they wish to perform. These commands must be selected within a 
short period of time.

Gateway to Apshai (3077) (c) 1983 Connelley Group, The / Epyx, Inc. 
 
Turmoil rocks the land and the only salvation lies in the magic of the Temple of Apshai. 
Unfortunately the location of this temple has gotten lost in time. Furthermore, many heros dispatched 
to seek it have been slain. A legend speaks that only the blood of the greatest hero of Apshai's 
greatest hero will be able to reclaim the lost Temple of Apshai. Unfortunately this "greatest hero" 
has also perished. But all hope is not lost, for the wise man, Merlis has  found the hero's son, 
whose blood is still able to fulfill the prophesy. With great haste, Merlis brings the youngster to 
the dungeon pits and leaves him to fend for himself. It is this youngster's destiny to find safe 
passage through the 8 levels, each of which contains passage to 99 different areas, 
 
Gateway to Apshai is a top-down action-RPG. As the desendant of a hero, the player starts with basic 
stats in 4 areas, Strength, Agility, Luck and Health. and basic equipment, a dagger and leather 
armor. Then it's time to choose a number between 1 and 99 to generate the dungeon. Once begun, the 
player must explore the dungeon, hidden until explored and revealed. The player can move in four 
directions and has standard abilities, each mapped to a different control. There are several 
different actions available to the player. These include: fighting with the equipped weapon, a LOCATE 
spell to discover traps in the room, a SEARCH spell to discover hidden doors inside of room which 
would otherwise look like ordinary walls.  Players may also use many of the items and scrolls that 
can be picked up in the dungeon. The treasure can be picked up which include weaponry (swords, bows 
and arrows), healing slaves, precious items and magical scrolls. Most items are only good for a 
single use. 
 
The Gateway to Apshai is guarded by an assortment of creatures including snakes, swamp rats, bats and 
many more. These enemies are only visible when they are in the same room as the player and are 
otherwise hidden. After 6 minutes and 30 seconds has passed, the player is teleported to the next 
dungeon, many versions of the game also offer the option to manually leave the dungeon at any time. 
Dungeons get progressively more difficult with faster and more vicious enemies.

Gauntlet (3081) (c) 1986 Atari Games Corporation / U.S. Gold Ltd. 
 
Gauntlet, the original arcade smash hit, is a fighting game where you choose a character and let rip 
into the hordes of enemies that assault you on you way to the end of the level. One or two players 
must make their way through 100 levels of mayhem and magic. 
 
It featured a choice of four characters to play with, each with different weapons. Thor the Warrior, 
has a  bludgeoning battle axe, Thyra the Valkyrie, has a close range sword, Questor the Elf has his 
long range bow, and Merlin the Wizard has magical bolts. 
 
Ghosts, goblins and even the life draining Death are your enemies. Enemies stream out of generators, 
so destroy these before tackling the rest. 
 
Keys are needed to open the many doors within the levels, and in some situations a door will contain 
only bonus items, not a progressive route.  Scattered magic potions act like smart bombs and clear 
the screen of all enemies. Beware of poison though, this reduces your energy level. 
Treasure is abundant throughout the levels and adds to your score.

Gauntlet III (c) 1991 Tengen Inc. / U.S. Gold Ltd. 
 
Like in the prequels you empty areas infested by all kinds of enemies while running for the exit. 
Like this was rather a straight forward thing in the first two games, it's not that easy to finish a 
level anymore. While you only had to run until you find the exit (and besides killing hordes of 
enemies you probably find some keys to unlock doors leading to deeper dungeons) you might have to 
solve a few "quests" to proceed to the next level in this installment. 
These "quests" are very basic, for example you have to find object A, then bring it to B, advance to 
C and finally go to D to uncover the exit. 
The big difference is the graphics. While you had a top down view in the first 2 games Gauntlet 3 has 
an isometric kind of view. 
The old 4 characters (warrior, wizard, elf and valkyrie) are ready for action again and this time 
they get backup by 4 new characters which include the Lizard, Neptune, Stoneman and the Iceman.

This was the first of the two football games licensed around Paul Gascoigne, then the most expensive 
player in British football history. The game is viewed top down, and can be set to either move 
left-right or top-bottom. 
 
League and cup tournaments are included, as are single matches and set-piece practice sections (you 
have full control of these). The gameplay involves a number of advanced moves, and includes a gauge 
to control the exact dimensions of a kick (height and curl as well as strength), if you can use it 
quickly enough. Unusually, you have control over the goalkeeper, so can only blame yourself when you 
concede a goal. The players each have their own skills and strengths, and these develop as the game 
goes on – if you play well, your players become better, and more capable of facing better opposition.

This top-down puzzle game starts with a screen featuring a number of red cogs at different parts of 
the screen, and a grid of pegs (which become less complete on later levels). Your task on each level 
is to use a number of gears of one of 3 different sizes to ensure that all the pegs are linked 
together. All this has to be completed before the engine overheats. 
 
Making life harder are two creatures with the peculiar name ‘Poffins’. One of these goes around 
removing pegs, and the other causes the engine to overheat further. They can be shot out of the way, 
or have gears placed over them to stop them. 
 
There’s also a bonus round, which is a fruit machine, only with cogs and other things from the game 
rather than fruit.

the sky. It targets the feel of pioneering races between 250mph planes in the valleys of the southern 
USA between brave but honest goggle-wearing men - a sort of Mille Miglia in the sky. 
 
The game consists of 16 courses, which are marked out by giant suspended cones, each of which is to 
be completed against a time limit, while avoiding contact with the other planes. You must stay within 
the cones, any time spent outside it results in the alloted time ticking down at a prohibitively fast 
rate (so don't think of short-cutting the track). After every second successful race, you take on a 
bonus track, in which balloons must be hit for points.

Gemstone Healer (9717) (c) 1986 Paradigm Creators, Inc. / Strategic Simulations, Inc. 
 
The Gemstone saga continues in Gemstone Healer the adventure game that is the sequel to SSI's highly 
acclaimed award winning Gemstone Warrior where you braved the horrors of the Netherworld dungeons to 
recover the pieces and restore the Gemstone to its rightful place in the Temple.  Now, to your dismay 
the Gemstone has lost its powers because the pieces have been damaged and you must return to the 
Netherworld to locate the healing tools and heal each part. Then you can fuse all the pieces together 
into a complete working Gemstone.

Gemstone Warrior (3099) (c) 1984 Paradigm Creators, Inc. / Strategic Simulations, Inc. 
 
The Gemstone Warrior is part action game, part adventure game.  Players work their way through an 
underground catacomb, doing three things at once.  First they need to find five pieces of a gemstone, 
spread throughout the maze.  Second they need to avoid getting killed by the guardians of the 
catacomb.  Finally they need to map the game, because the place is so large that it is easy to get 
lost.  Once the Gemstone Warrior has collected the five gemstone pieces, he needs to move back to the 
point where he began the game. 
 
The hero has to go underground because of demons.  They stole the gemstone from humans, because they 
were jealous of the good magic it brought to humankind.  They broke it up and spread it throughout 
their dungeon, to hide it. 
 
This game is not just a shoot-em-up.  It has many of the features of that style of game, but also 
gives players time to think.  It includes a pause which helps one map and also to freeze a room, to 
see what is running toward the Gemstone Warrior.   The game also has a save feature, which is useful 
just before entering a new room: if the Gemstone Warrior is ambushed, players can give him another 
chance. 
 
After killing opponents, the Gemstone Warrior has the opportunity to search the bodies for treasure.  
Monsters carry arrows, and also "magic bolts."  The last are interesting, as they destroy treasure 
too, as well as the Gemstone Warrior, should he be too close to the explosion.  Magic items abound, 
and help the warrior make it through the caverns.  Some magic items are traps too

Gem'X (3096) (c) 1991 Kaiko / Demonware Softwarehaus GmbH 
 
Like so many other puzzle games of the time, this game involves tiles of different colours, which 
must be manipulated to clear a succession of increasingly-difficult levels. 
 
The basic idea is that you are presented with 2 sets of tiles, and must make the left one identical 
to the 'control' set on the right. The colours are defined in a sequence - red, green, blue, purple, 
yellow - and when you click on a tile, that tile's colour moves forward by two in that sequence (for 
example a blue one becomes yellow), whereas the tiles next to it move by one colour (for example, 
blue becomes purple). 
 
Any that move past the end fo the sequence disappear, causing surrounding blocks to drop. You get a 
limited number of moves, and limited time as well. Fortuantely there are passwords, delivered by 
cutely-drawn naked Japanese girls (although the private parts are covered up).

First of SSI's "When Superpowers Collide" series. Strategic simulation of a conflict between US and 
Soviet forces. In Germany 1985 the Soviet forces attack NATO in West Germany in two different 
scenarios. In the first, Advance to Combat, Russian and US forces of similar strength race to 
establish a cohesive front line. The second scenario, Invasion, begins with Soviet airborne divisions 
landing behind NATO lines to block key roads and capture towns in preparation for the main advancing 
force. In both scenarios, the victory conditions are the same: the player controlling the greatest 
number of towns after a certain number of game turns is the winner.

Gertrude's Secrets (14948) (c) 1984 The Learning Co. / The Learning Co. 
 
Gertrude's Secrets is, in brief, what you get when you take Warren Robinett's Adventure for the VCS 
(right down to the quacking dragon-duck!) and turn it into an educational object-sorting game for a 
younger audience than the earlier Robot Odyssey and Rocky's Boots. 
 
Gertrude is a benevolent goose who maintains what might be considered a dungeon: a complex of 
chambers containing puzzles which yield secrets -- treasures -- upon completion.  But instead of 
monsters, the rooms contain something much scarier to a child: education in the fields of logic, 
pattern-matching (of colours, shapes and textures) and sorting, categorized internally as Array 
Puzzles, Loop Puzzles and Train Puzzles. 
 
The player interacts with the game world by moving a cursor around the screen with keyboard or 
joystick, picking up and dropping objects in appropriate places to make things happen -- triggering 
puzzles or attempting to solve them.  The puzzles gradually ramp up in difficulty, and a wide 
selection of whimsical trophies are awarded.  To prolong gameplay enjoyment and the exploration of 
the play environment, Robinett's trademark easter eggs are in the eaves, as well as UI manipulation 
well before its time, allowing players to "skin" the game with different tilesets or manually edit 
individual tiles.

Gettysburg: The Turning Point is a grand tactical simulation of the most famous, well known and 
arguably the most decisive battle of the Civil War fought at the little town of Gettysburg, 
Pennsylvania from July 1 to July 3, 1863. 
 
The game uses a refined version of SSI's Antietam game system and is played in 42 turns each 
representing 1 hour of real time over a 3 day period.. Players are awarded points based on casualties 
and territorial objectives. At the end of each turn and the end of the game points are calculated and 
compared to a chart which determines your level of victory. 
 
The game can be played under 3 different sets of rules (Basic, Intermediate and Advanced) with 5 
levels of difficulty for each and can be played against another person or the computer can play 
either side.

player sees – control and viewpoint passes from the kicker to the receiver on a punt or kickoff, and 
the quarterback to the running back or receiver on a pass or kick. Releasing passes involves rotating 
the controls to select the pass direction. To take the ball, aim the visible hands in the centre of 
the screen. 
 
There are 28 teams split into four divisions

Ghostbusters (3133) (c) 1984 Activision, Inc. / Activision, Inc. 
 
Based on the movie of the same name, the Ghostbusters are the ones to call who will "bust" any ghost 
hauntings. It does this through the use of nuclear accelerated "proton packs" and traps, whereby the 
ghosts can be captured and transferred to a secure storage facility. However New York City has 
suddenly become a very haunted place, and the number of ghosts has suddenly increased. The 
Ghostbusters must reduce the paranormal (PK) level in the city, representing ghost power, before the 
Temple of Zuul awakens and ressurects an evil goddess, Gozer. 
 
Ghostbusters is an action game that combines an overhead view and a side-view. From Ghostbusters HQ, 
the player must monitor the map of New York City for "ghost alarms" as well as casual spirits, and 
plot a route to the alarmed area. The player then controls the Ghostbuster vehicle as it drives 
through traffic. Here, the player is able to capture casual ghosts on the way if they are en route. 
Once at the location, the game switches to a side-view. Two of the ghostbusters will take position 
and activate their proton beams and toss a trap to the ground. The player will attempt to  maneuver 
the ghost(s) over the placed trap. Once activated, the trap attempts to capture any ghosts directly 
above it. Successful capture will earn the player money, which can then be used to purchase new 
Ghostbusters vehicles and new modifications for the vehicle. Unsuccessful capture will see the ghost 
fly away. 
 
As the game progresses, the PK energy of the city increases. Ghostbusters must keep it under critical 
levels by being constantly  successful at ghost captures. Eventually the Temple of Zuul will 
activate, and if the PK levels are still manageable, the Ghostbusters can venture there for a final 
showdown with Gozer.

settle in that place. 
 
You control Harry on his mission. The game features sixteen screens that Harry must traverse: the 
attic, the kitchen, the library, the sewers and more. Ghosts roam the corridors and must be avoided 
or jumped over. The first few times Harry is touched by a ghost, he is not killed immediately, but 
merely immobilized from the shock. But further attacks from ghosts and also high falls may kill him. 
Thankfully Harry can defend himself and throw stones at some of the ghosts to kill them. 
The doors to the next rooms are often locked, so Harry must find keys to open them. 
The game can be played by one player or two players taking turns.

Three years have passed since Arthur defeated the Demon King Astaroth and rescued his beloved 
Princess Prin-Prin (see Ghosts 'N Goblins). A new villain, the Great Demon King Lucifer (Loki in some 
versions) has become the new leader of Ghoul Realm. While returning from a journey, Arthur sees the 
Princess' castle and her village under attack by Lucifer's forces. While rushing towards her beloved 
knight, the Princess is struck by one of Lucifer's laser beams. 
 
Now, Arthur must venture back to the Lucifer's palace and destroy the demon in order to rescue the 
Princess' soul and bring her back to life! And it won't matter whether he fights in his shining armor 
or in his underwear alone...the bravest Knight in the land isn't going to be stopped by some 
monsters! Although the game starts with graveyard and marsh territory familiar from the first game, 
later levels are set in a tower, a mass of skeletons, and a castle. 
 
Players progress from left to right (from bottom to top in level 3), and have to hack down the 
aforementioned monsters with a sword. The journey includes ledges, ladders, lava pits and slippery 
slopes. Different weapons can be collected, by finding suits of armor inside chests. Each of the five 
stages has its own setting and a final boss.

The giant had only been dazed by the fall and had built a series of underground caverns, which are 
now his domain. The giant is seeking revenge, telling Jack that there are lots of treasures 
underground, including the “Elixir of Life”. A series of traps await Jack in all seven caverns. Jack

Based on a flop 1984 movie of the same name, you play as music star Paul McCartney whose master tape 
for his new album has been accidentally erased.  The engineers have managed to recover all the tracks 
except the first single "No More Lonely Nights".  The group's backer, Rath, has given you until 
midnight on Saturday to remix the track and McCartney must drive around London searching out 7 band 
members who each have part of the tune then return to Abbey Road Studios in order to complete the 
track.  You must read each person's profile to anticipate their movement and go to major London 
locations or subway Tube stations where they might appear. 
 
The upper two-thirds of the screen usually shows a top-down view of the roads and your car as you 
guide it.  It then will show a scene when you encounter a band member.  The lower portion of the 
screen is your car's on-board computer showing an image of the next person to meet, the Tube station 
they will go in or out of and the time remaining.  There's also a small map of your surrounding 
location and a blip showing where you are, and also the name of the nearest Tube station and the 
remaining time and music parts in your quest.  As you drive the roads, you must avoid crashes and 
Rath's thugs who will be following you.  You must also time your arrivals at the Tube stations 
because if you arrive too early and wait around too long, a parking authority will clamp your car.

Each reactor is protected by lasers, although by running into the nearest control tower these can be

previously shot down is not reset, making the second attempt easier Chase HQ style. As you destroy 
enemies you gain access to better planes, and the rank reported at the end of the game improves – 
this is also dependent on the skill level you play at.

Glug Glug (3176) (c) 1984 CRL Group PLC / CRL Group PLC 
 
As a deep sea diver, you sense an opportunity to gain untold wealth from the large number of 
treasures which have drifted to the bottom of the ocean. You do this by attaching yourself to your 
diving station and moving down the infested waters, grabbing an item of treasure and moving it back 
up to the station. 
 
Various fish are around, including crabs, piranhas and squids, all of which move in their own ways, 
and can be shot with your gun. Worst of all are the sharks which can cut through your cord - make 
sure they do not swim above you close to the line. The cord can go through other fish safely and 
unimpeded, but contact with the fishes themselves costs you a life. You have 32 screens to plunder.

Ingrid Bottomlow stands out from her family of gnomes - she's a gifted student, with a degree from 
the Institute of Gnome Economics. As a result, they exile her using a teleporting spell, leaving her 
lost in the forest. It is your job to keep her safe in this interactive fiction game. 
 
The game is split into three tasks, broadly relating to animal, vegetable and mineral in that order. 
The first involves defeating an evil witch, the second is the Riddle of the Shrinking Teapot, and the 
third involves precious stones. 
 
Commands such as FOLLOW, FIND and GO TO make travelling the game world much easier, and put an 
emphasis on object-manipulation and character interaction, rather than map-making. 
 
Instructions can be issued to other characters, with words like THEN, FIND and GIVE to join them. 
This co-operation is essential to solve many puzzles, and takes place in a world where characters 
have their own aims and motives. There are BRIEF and VERBOSE modes of text. The screen display adds a 
'g' to the start of all words beginning with n - 'gnorth' and 'gnugget' for example.

Godzilla threatens Japan and it’s up to the player to use the combined force of Japan’s army, navy, 
air force, and nuclear arsenal to defeat him.  Godzilla is a turn-based game played out over Japan 
and its surrounding waters which are mapped out on a grid.  Godzilla starts randomly on the map and 
moves erratically from tile to tile.  On the player’s turn, the player can attack Godzilla with 
available units in the same sector as Godzilla, move units to an adjacent sector, launch a missile at 
Godzilla or authorize an atomic strike.  At the end of each turn, the game tallies the damage done to 
Godzilla and the corresponding loss to Japanese forces and the civilian population.  The game ends 
either with Godzilla’s death or with Godzilla victorious over a devastated Japan.

Golden Baton, The (3208) (c) 1983 
 
Your mission is to retrieve the Golden Baton, a priceless artifact worshipped by your race for eons. 
It maintains balance and keeps peace in the land, but now it has been stolen! Many have searched for 
it, none have returned. The player will face wolves and crabs, navigate a boat trip, and deal with a 
magical crystal. Most of the way, you use one object in some way to gain another. 
 
Golden Baton uses the Scott Adams adventure engine, and thus has the same features - a basic 2-word 
parser, limited vocabulary (object names plus standard words such as EXAMINE, WEAR and DROP), and 
brief descriptions.  Although primitive by later standards, these compare favourably to other IF of 
the time.

Play Eliza, Conway's Life, Crowther's Adventure, or Al Alcorn's Pong. 
 
All four games are liberal adaptations - there is no standard Eliza, and this version seems to lack 
compared to others. Pong is an ASCII rendition of the game (and includes a remake with color!). Life, 
however, includes various pre-formed populations, including the infamous glider-gun that figures 
prominently in Steven Levy's book Hackers.

Golf's Best (St Andrews) (3219) (c) 1986 
 
Golf's Best: St. Andrews - The Home of Golf is a golf simulation which allows you to experience the 
layout and character of one of the world's most famous courses, St. Andrews. Each hole is simulated 
exactly to scale. Undulations in the terrain, such as actual hills and valleys as found on the course 
as well as trees, bushes, water, sand and buildings are included. Wind also plays a part in the 
simulation. St. Andrews is a very windy course. 
 
The game's display provides all the information required to make a great shot. Each hole provides an 
overhead and side view. Wind on the course is displayed by an arrow at the bottom of the screen which 
points in the direction in which the wind is blowing and that your ball will tend to blow. The larger 
the arrow, the harder the wind is blowing. It also shows you where the ball is, how far you are from 
the pin, what surface you are on and what stroke you are about to hit. 
 
Up to 4 players can play at a time. Enter your name. Select what type of tees that you wish to play 
from, Medal or Championship. Once selected, they will remain the same throughout the entire round. 
Choose the starting hole. Pressing the Enter key without specifying the hole will start you on the 
first hole. You are allowed to carry 14 clubs. One must be a putter. The club selection screen also 
gives you the prevailing wind speed and direction. This allows you to choose the correct clubs for 
the conditions. After choosing your club (C), choose how hard to swing (F). Force of stroke depends 
on the club used. Irons and Woods choices are full, three-quarters, half or quarter swings. Wedges 
and putter, you enter the force as a number representing the number of feet. Your choices will be 
displayed. Specify what direction to hit the ball (D) and whether to hook or slice (S). Once your 
selections are completed, hit the "1" key to hit the ball. 
 
Order of play is determined by honors, the player with the lowest score on the preceding hole plays 
first. If you select hole 19, you will enter the clubhouse and your round will be over. Display the 
Scorecard by hitting the "4" key. Have a good round.

Goonies, The (3225) (c) 1985 Datasoft, Inc. / Datasoft, Inc. 
 
Datasoft's The Goonies is one of the most fondly-remembered games in the genre of platform 
action-adventure-puzzle games for which Datasoft was known (other games included Conan: Hall of 
Volta, Bruce Lee, and Zorro, all well-regarded classics). 
 
The game is licensed from the internationally-beloved Steven Speilberg film of the same name, in 
which a motley crew of suburban kids in Astoria, Oregon, must save their homes from being foreclosed 
upon and find their salvation in a treasure map leading to an old pirate ship in a cavern.  However, 
they must maneuver around an eccentric family of Italian criminals -- the Fratellis -- on the lam, 
who are also on the trail of the treasure. 
 
The game is divided into a series of eight screens based on scenes from the film, each of which 
contains unique and creative puzzles that must be solved by coordinating the activities of two of the 
kids from the Goonies (and in the last screen, the elephant-man-like Sloth) without getting killed by 
deadly bats, homicidal Fratellis, flying demon-skull thingies, or other environmental hazards.  For 
example, in one screen one player must wind up and hold a winch that lifts a large stone so that the 
other player can pass it, run backward on a ball floating in deadly water, bypass a series of three 
water buckets going up and down that kill you if you do not time your passage underneath correctly, 
jump to the top of a rail, and slide across to grab the key to the door below -- and all this without 
getting hit by a wandering bat. 
 
One of the characteristic elements of this series of games is that it was organized more like an 
arcade game than an adventure game

Gordian Tomb (3226) (c) 1990 X-ample Architectures / Computec Verlag GmbH & Co. KG 
 
Gordian Tomb is a flip-screen platform/adventure game from Germany. Montezuma's Revenge seems to be a 
major influence on the overall design. The main protagonist is a relic hunter that must explore a 
pyramid to find a secret treasure room. He must pick up and use various tools on his way to overcome 
obstacles and access unreachable areas. Objects are collected by colliding with them. In order to be 
able to collect an object, the player must first find the screen where it has to be used. Otherwise, 
the object can't be taken and the game gives a warning in the hint area: "Later dude!". The 
protagonist has to avoid death by wild animals, dangerous environments and supernatural phenomena. On 
the top of the screen there is the ever-decreasing timer. Below that is displayed a hint (if 
available) about the screen, usually describing what object can be used. At the bottom there are 
several slots for the paraphernalia collected, and below that images of the protagonist as the number 
of lives. 
 
The game starts with a 32 minutes time limit and 8 lives, and has no form of saving progress.

You are a graffiti artist who must get through four locations while avoiding all kinds of people that 
are constantly shooting projectiles or objects at you. These people include old men, police officers, 
skaters, and women that throw flowerpots on your head. If you come into contact with people, you will 
lose a life. When you get hit by a projectile or object, you lose one of your spray cans, and if you 
run out of these, you will also lose a life. 
 
When you get to the end of each location, you will reach a wall where you can spray-paint on. If you 
spray over the specific regions, you will get rewarded for your effort. You are on a time limit on 
these sections, and when time runs out, you move to the next location. 
 
When you have completed this short game, you are treated to a paint program that lets you spray-paint 
at your own free will, without a time limit. You can choose the size of the paint, its color and 
density. In the Amiga version, you can also clear the display if you make a mistake.

Grand Monster Slam (3245) (c) 1989 Golden Goblins / Rainbow Arts Software GmbH 
 
Every five years the various races inhabiting the fantasy world of GHoLD meet for the Grand Monster 
Slam tournament to discover which is supreme. You must win a total of 9 matches to prove yourself, 
with two sub-games to negotiate (Revenge of the Beloms and Faulton Feeding - fortunately these can be 
practiced from the main menu) as well. 
 
The basic game sees you and your opponent start with a row of six Beloms (small round creatures) 
which must be kicked across the pitch quickly enough to leave your opponent with all 12 at his end. 
When this happens you can run to his end to win. The main things to avoid during the match are being 
hit by a shot and kicking one into the crowd. When hit you lose time recovering, and are penalised 
with a Pelvan, which can cost you up to 3 Beloms, by hitting the crowd. 
 
After every third match you must play the Faulton Feeding game, which involves aiming at six 
progressively-higher poles to hit the Faulton creature with the food - fail to get enough of these 
and you must replay the previous match. After other games you play the Revenge of the Beloms game, in 
which Beloms hurtle towards you and must be deflected away with your pole - failure to clear enough 
before one hits you reduces your score from the previous match.

Grand Prix Circuit (3248) (c) 1988 Distinctive Software, Inc. / Accolade, Inc. 
 
Formula One racing is recreated in detail in this simulation. You can drive a McLaren, Ferrari or 
Williams car, each with different qualities, around the real-life Formula One circuits including 
Monaco, Suzuka and the original Hockenheim circuit characterized by long straights. Rival drivers 
also have their own styles and strengths, and to win the World Championship you will have to master 
these. Pitstop timing and planning is crucial as well, although only tires are changed in late-1980s 
F1. Graphics are sprite-based.

Grand Prix Master (3250) (c) 1988 Dinamic Software / Dinamic Software 
 
A motorcycle racing game recreating the now-defunct 80cc world motorcycle racing championship. It was 
licensed around Spanish ace Jorge Martinez 'Aspar', and your (and his) racing rivals including future 
500cc World Champion Alex Criville. 
 
The game features a full practice mode as well as qualifying and races. There are only 8 computer 
bikes, although the real life championship points system is used, meaning that the penalty for not 
finishing is bigger than in real life, especially as you only have 5 bikes to last the season. The 
game is viewed from overhead, and the controls are, unusually, direction based, so to take a straight 
which (in the overhead view) involves going up and to the right, you must push the joystick in that 
direction.

Calling it a 'simulator' was a stretch, as with many of Codemasters' titles. In reality it was an 
overhead-view Super Sprint style arcade racer for 1 or 2 players, similar in many ways to the 
company's BMX Simulator. 
 
There were up to 14 circuits depending on the format, which incorporated many underpasses (some of 
them deliberately unrealistic) and tight curves. There were oil slicks to avoid and points bonuses to 
pick up. 
 
The cars have slow acceleration but a lot of power down the straights. You are scored based on your 
overall time and your fastest lap. Lose to the computer car and it's game over.

An indelible memory for the entire '80s cohort of UK schoolchildren, this educational game, 
originally released in 1983 on the BBC Micro, solicits textual input from the player regarding the 
correct approach and technique for rescuing three pairs of royal children from a wicked witch.  A 
variety of puzzle types with a wide and whimsical supporting cast kept classes of kids debating the 
correct course of action through an array of different environments, progress through each tracked 
courtesy of a password system. 
 
Some 15 or so years later, the game's developers eventually released a multimedia-enhanced remake of 
it for modern operating systems.

GAC - The Graphic Adventure Creator (3258) (c) 1986 Incentive Software Ltd. / Incentive Software Ltd. 
 
The Graphic Adventure creator is a tool to create interactive fiction games. A utility to draw 
background graphics is included, but it is also possible to create text-only games. 
 
You're allowed to define up to 255 nouns, 255 verbs, 255 adverbs and 9999 rooms, as long as your 
adventure doesn't get bigger than 23k. For an adventure to work, it is also necessary to define 
several conditions (i.e. what happens if certain conditions are true/false). 
 
Conditions are divided into high priority, low priority and local conditions. High priority 
conditions are checked before the player can input any commands. Their uses include checking whether 
the player is still alive, or letting certain non-interactive events happen (upon entering a room, 
for example). 
Local priority conditions are checked after player input and deal with things local to a particular 
room e.g. whether certain objects are in that room. Low priority conditions work similar to local 
priority conditions with the difference that they are not confined to  individual rooms, and check 
,for example, which objects you are carrying. 
 
The parser features it-detection and understands multiple commands per line (e.g. take box and open 
it). 
 
To make creating games a little easier, GAC includes a quick start file  with many preset verbs and 
messages like "take", "look", "What now?", "Pardon?" etc., that are commonly used in adventures. Also 
included are two short "sample" adventures, one with graphics and one text only.

Great Escape, The (3272) (c) 1986 Denton Designs / Thunder Mountain 
 
The Great Escape is an isometric action-adventure game. 
 
Gather round, kids, and listen to grandpa tell of his time as a prisoner of war in Germany. ‘Twas 
back in 1942. Those were rough times, lads. Rough times. Been shot down in my plane. Darn shame it 
was, it being a good plane and all. Next I know, there’s this group of German soldiers standing round 
me, and off we go to a P.O.W. camp. Big thing, that, plenty of guards all around with a keen eye on 
your every move, and full of unfortunate souls like myself. Just that they do naught but sit all day 
and sob and generally be no great help when it comes to doing the Great Escape. But not me, no sir! I 
showed them Germans, I did, and I was out of their fashionable high security “he who comes here, 
stays here” camp in no time. You wanna hear that story? Bet you do! 
 
Controlling a prisoner of war in a German camp, your goal is to break out undetected. There are 
numerous ways to freedom – back doors, cracked fences, even underground tunnels. However, you have to 
plan your escape while obeying the strict rules of the camp. 
 
Number one: Daily program. You have to attend two roll calls a day, one meal, one exercise, and stay 
in bed at night. Failure to appear at any of these events will result in the alarm being rung. When 
you do not touch the controls, your protagonist will move automatically, going to all important 
events. You have to detect and use gaps in the time-table to explore the camp. 
 
Rule number two: guard rooms are off limits. If a soldier catches you in a room that is forbidden, 
you will be placed in solitary confinement. Of course, you have to enter restricted parts of the camp 
to find items crucial for your escape. The moral flag will turn from green to red to indicate that 
you are in an area where you shouldn’t be. 
 
Rule no three: no prisoner may carry forbidden objects. When you are caught in a suspicious 
situation, you will be stripped of all items that you found so far. To avoid that, you have to 
deposit objects in a safe place. You need to find keys to open locked doors, uniforms for camouflage, 
flashlights to see in dark tunnels, and many more. 
 
Rule number four: guard commands are to be obeyed at all times. The German soldiers patrol on fixed 
routes and have a line of sight. You have to learn the guard’s routes and sneak past their backs to 
avoid detection when breaking out. If you are caught, your morale will decrease. If your morale 
reaches zero, your will to escape is broken.

Gremlins is an action game based on the Steven Spielberg movie of the same name. The game takes place

You control Billy from a 3rd person point of view. On each level, your goal is to catch all of the 
Mogwai and return them to their cage (located in the upper right corner of the screen) and to destroy 
all of the Gremlins with a sword. Each level has a time limit - at 6:00 am when the sun rises. You 
move on to the next level by completing your tasks or just surviving until 6:00, although more points 
are awarded for the former. You will also receive bonus points for each Mogwai returned to the cage. 
 
On many of the levels there will be various types of food lying about the screen. If a Mogwai eats 
any food, it will turn into a gremlin. There may also be  puddles of water

Based on the movie of the same name, Gremlins: The Adventure is an interactive fiction game by Brian 
Howarth, author of the Mysterious Adventures series. Players take the role of Billy, who has already 
been tricked into feeding Gizmo after midnight, and now Kingston Falls is in danger of being overrun 
with Gremlins.  With Gizmo's help, Billy must save the town before it is too late. 
 
There are some animated graphics in this one.  The game has less than 50 locations, though time is a 
factor - the gremlins home in on Billy with every move he makes, so there is no chance to dawdle. The 
design means that deaths are more frequent than in most adventures. It uses the same parser as the 
other Adventure International games of this era.

Gribbly's Day Out (3291) (c) 1985 Graftgold Ltd. / Hewson Consultants Ltd. 
 
Gribbly Grobbly is a Blabgorian, the most advanced species on planet Blabgor. He must rescue 
Gribblets, infants who have wandered off through this dangerous world. It is split into sixteen 
levels - apart from the first and last, these are played in a random order each time. Gribbly can 
blow bubbles, as a weapon. 
 
Levels are comprised of a giant Energy Web of diagonally-linked protective beams, parts of which can 
be disabled using switches. The web is to shield you from Seon, a rogue Blabgorian who uses his 
powers as a negative force. When there is only one Gribblet left, the barriers are released and Seon 
is free to chase you down. 
 
There are two initial types of active foes - seed pods (which move) and Chrysalis (which don't). Both 
hurt you on contact but are destroyed by bubbles. However, if Seed pods hit the ground they transform 
into Topsies (which can flip the Gribblets onto their backs, making them vulnerable), and if Crysalis 
are not destroyed quickly enough they turn into Stompers (which are indestructible and can kill 
Gribblets, but die on contact with water and are not intelligent to avoid it). When a Stomper kills a 
Gribblet, it becomes a Flier, which can re-release Gribblets - forcing you to quickly grab them.

Moving toward you in a zig-zag is a chain of pods.  The object is to shoot them before they get the

live pods on either side form two new chains, both moving toward you. 
 
Further complicating the game are two guns outside the grid, shooting at your ship from beneath and 
from your left side.  You are able to move into the grid, toward the pod-chain, to avoid the guns.  
The combination puts pressure on you, from front, back and the side.

In this Defender clone, you are a spaceship that must protect humanoids on the mountainous terrain 
from approaching aliens. To help you, you are equipped with two weapons. The rapid fire laser is used 
to destroy any aliens in sight, while the limited supply of smart bombs vaporize alien life on 
screen. (Extra smart bombs are awarded every 10,000 points. Hyperspace can also be used to warp from 
one part of the planet to another, in the hope of rescuing the humanoids faster. 
 
When Landers, one of the enemies, get close to the nearest humanoid, the Landers will pick them up 
and make their way to the top of the screen. If you do not shoot the Landers before they reach the 
status bar, both them, plus the captured humanoid, will explode. If you manage to shoot the Lander, 
the humanoid is released and it is your job to maneuver the ship under them so they can be taken back 
to the terrain. If you don't do this, then the humanoid will explode once they reach the terrain. 
 
A scanner, found at the top of the screen, shows the location of your ship, enemies, and humanoids. 
This scanner is very useful in keeping track of enemies that are approaching you from behind, as well 
as locating the enemies that have captured humanoids. Once you have killed all enemies in the level, 
the next level begins. Bonus points are awarded for each humanoid saved.

Guerrilla War - Hail the Heroes (3326) (c) 1988 SNK Corporation / Imagine 
 
A tropical island (specified as Cuba in the Japanese original) is being oppressed by a dictator, but 
fortunately one or two brave US soldiers (Ernesto "Che" Guevara in the Japanese version) are on hand 
to restore justice. March through the rivers, swamps and forests to overthrow the dictator (specified 
as Batista in Japan) in this evolution of the Commando style. 
 
The game scrolls vertically, as you move up the screen shooting enemies, finding good strategic 
firing points and collecting powerups. As the enemy soldiers come towards you in groups, some care is 
required when picking them off, either using your gun or the grenades. There are also hostages 
carried by some soldiers, with points bonuses for not shooting these but shooting their captors. Each 
level ends with a boss.

Produced as a product tie-in with OTA's honey puff cereal, Guldkornexpressen (or Kalaspuffsexpressen) 
revolves around the brand's bear mascot, who drives a train filled with honey puffs. His task on each 
level is to pick up boxes of the cereal, add honey and drive the train to the end of the level, where 
the cargo is loaded into a big box of Guldkorn. 
 
It is not just a straight forward career along the tracks, though. Switches must be set back and 
forth for the train to go on the right tracks, there are rocks and fallen trees on the track, and you 
must keep your speed so as not to crash into things. Fortunately for Puff the bear, he has a honeybee 
friend. By tapping the joystick button, you activate the bee. It is the bee's task to activate the 
switches and to operate the honey tap. If you hold in the joystick button, you activate an action 
menu to deal with obstacles. You can choose to jump over fallen trees, throw dynamite at rocks or to 
let the bear jump out and dig away dirt from the tracks.

Gun.Smoke is a top-down scrolling shooter that casts the gamer as a lone gunman, out to save the 
   gold rush town of Hicksville from a fearsome group of bandits known as the Wingates. Each level 
   has a particular target enemy, although his or her henchmen must also be taken out. 
 
Although it largely takes place on foot, the gameplay resembles Commando, with its top-down action. 
The screen scrolls at a constant rate, and enemies come at you from the edges, to be shot or avoided. 
You can grab various power-ups along the way. Finding a horse will allow you to get hit twice before 
you die rather than just once. There are scenes in which you raft up a river and use the tracks of a 
railway line. 
 
On the NES you can tap the A button to fire up and right, the B button to fire up and left, or A and 
B simultaneously to fire straight ahead. One-button control systems mimic all this.

You must destroy a giant alien being in orbit around the earth ... from the inside! 
 
The game is a shoot-em-up, where you explore 16 maze-like levels, shooting various enemies that live 
within the alien.  There are various objects to help you, including different weapons (effective 
against different enemies), and a map of each level. 
 
You must destroy 4 of the alien's organs, the kidneys, heart, lungs and finally the brain, that 
appear on the 4th, 8th, 12th and 16th level respectively.  However, to destroy each organ you need to 
find the 3 parts of a weapon that can bypass that organ's defences. 
 
The levels are interconnected, and although progress is mostly from level 1 to level 2, etc, some 
backtracking may be needed to find all the weapon components.

Gyroscope (3365) (c) 1985 Catalyst Coders / Melbourne House 
 
Releasing a game which resembles a well-known arcade game before any official license can be released 
was always a challenge for publishers, and in this case Melbourne House released a game similar to 
Marble Madness. Controlling a gyroscope, you most navigate your way down a sloping track full of 
hazards. The viewpoint is in fixed isometric 3D, with hazards including buildings, ramps and drops. 
The gyroscope accelerates quickly and takes time to slow down, so it is easy to go into a screen too 
fast. 
 
Failing to keep the gyroscope spinning freely as it navigates these costs you one of your seven 
lives. You are also playing within a time limit - losing a life sees you return to the start of a 
level without regaining lost time, but running out of time sees you lose a life, but be able to 
continue from where you were left with a new set of time (so, as with Chase HQ, completing tricky 
levels can take 2 or 3 lives at first). 
 
You get time bonuses for completing a screen, points bonuses for completing one of the seven 
four-screen levels, and an extra life for reaching 1000 points. 
At the end of level 7, you will get 1000 points for each remaining lives, doubling your current 
amount of lives. You will then start again at level 1 but mirrored by the vertical axis (you are now 
climbing from the bottom of screen to the top). 
After level 14 (level 7 mirror), you will again win 1000 points for each remaining lives and then the 
game loop on level 1 (not mirrored).

double canon after shooting a power up satelite. After clearing each planet, there is another bonus 
stage where additional weapons and bonus points can be collected. Gyruss is an arcade action shooter, 
however instead of piloting your spaceship horizontally or vertically, you move in a circle around 
the perimeter of the screen. The NES version of Gyruss adds to the original arcade version additional

Habitat (c) Jan, 1987 Lucasfilm Games LLC / Lucasfilm Games LLC 
 
Habitat is a MMO (massive multiplayer online game), originally designed by Chip Morningstar and Noah 
Falstein at Lucasfilm Games. Although it is not the first online game, it lay the groundwork for 
modern MMORPGs by allowing more than 20,000 gamers to play in the same open-ended, virtual world, 
even though it doesn't contain typical RPG characteristics such as levelling, skills, abilities and 
classes. Still, Habitat forms the link between text-based MUDs that rarely topped the 100-player mark 
and modern MMORPGs. Because of the limited trial phase it was released in, it never contained more 
than 500 players. 
 
The game was originally released as a beta test and could only be played through Quantum Link, an 
online service of Quantum Computer Services (which later became America OnLine), and was only 
available in the evenings and weekends, as network traffic was cheaper at those moments. You control 
an avatar, seen from a third-person perspective in a 2D world. Avatars can gesture, move around, 
communicate with other characters, and manipulate objects. The world consists of thousands of regions 
- different environments that can be accessed through doors, teleportation and other entrances. You 
can also communicate through the in-game mail system or by using ESP (telepathic abilities), and 
personalise your avatar with the skin tone, features, or clothing. 
 
Players can visit stores, houses, pubs, forests... and use objects such as tools, weapons and magical 
items. The stress is on the social dimension. You can get married, play games, write a book, go 
adventuring, visit theatres or lectures, or start a company, a guild, or a religion. Each player has 
a bank account and there is an in-game economy based on tokens. The game designers even appeared in 
the game as powerful opponents and global quests were organised. These are presented as one-time 
challenges, and not as instances multiple players can encounter at different moments. Players can 
also turn into ghosts to discover new areas without risks. Although there are no real classes, people 
can behave as thieves, law enforcers or clergymen. There are no regulations and players are only 
limited to what the game code allows. Quests are provided by the Oracle, an almighty entity that 
'created' the Habitat. The libertarian approach with the freedom in gameplay was introduced because 
people solved quests too quickly and the developers would never be able to keep up with new content. 
 
New features were added gradually. Rather than controlling or limiting the possibilities, the 
developers observed gamers' behaviour and introduced novelties according to the needs. It also 
includes PvP fighting (player vs. player) and safe zones in the cities. Habitat has its own 
newspaper, The Rant, documenting events and reserved for announcements. 
 
The project was ended in 1988 when Quantum Link observed that the 500 players played the game so much 
that the game's traffic ate up 1% of the total capacity of the entire QL service. The company feared 
it would not be able to sustain the network with a full release open to many more players, and 
scrapped the project. It resurfaced later in 1988 as Club Caribe, and as Fujitsu Habitat in 1990 when 
the technology was licensed to Fujitsu. Eventually, Fujitsu bought it entirely and launched it as 
WorldsAway in 1995. The game currently lives on as Vzones and the fantasy variant Second Kingdom. 
Right now, the unrelated Second Life incorporates most of Habitat's mechanics.

Hacker (3371) (c) 1985 Activision, Inc. / Activision, Inc. 
 
Hacker is an adventure/trading game based on what was then a unique idea. You're starting into the 
adventure as a real hacker would do, lacking information of what is to come, only driven by your 
ambition. Consequently, the game opens with a plain text screen, prompting you for the login 
password. To break into the system is the first puzzle you've got to solve. 
 
Once in, you'll soon find out that you've accidentally stumbled upon a conspiracy of global impact. 
From then on, you'll maneuver a robotic drone around the globe through a tunnel system deep in the 
earth. In major cities, you may surface and talk to contact persons, who'll trade items for cash. 
When delivered to the correct city, you can exchange these items for a piece of evidence. If all 
evidence is collected, you're to inform the FBI. As if figuring out the correct routes and trades 
wasn't hard enough, frequent system malfunctions and security checks test your skill as well...

Hacker II - The Doomsday Papers (3373) (c) 1986 Activision, Inc. / Activision, Inc. 
 
Hacker II: The Doomsday Papers is a real-time strategy game. 
It is the sequel to Hacker 
 
Once again you hack into a computer system, just to end up saving the world. Hacker II: The Doomsday 
Papers opens with the console to the "Actisource" computer hotline system (a nice self-ironic pun - 
although nobody knows why a serious hacker might want to crack a help service for computer games...). 
However, your quiet little hack is soon disturbed: The government wants you for a secret mission. It, 
again,  involves a robot drone and you're the one at the remote control. Although this time, it's not 
the whole globe that's your playground, but a high security facility in Russia, where the plans for 
global domination are hidden. 
 
In fact, all you've got to do is to guide your drone to the vault on a 2D map of the building. 
However, there are two major obstacles: Patrolling guards and security cameras. To avoid detection, 
you've got to trick the observers. By tapping the surveillance system you can see what cameras are 
currently active and which rooms they monitor. Your task is to bypass the video signal of the right 
cameras with a taped recording of an empty room, so that your drone is hidden from the view. You 
control four monitors, which you may freely switch to show the security monitor, the radar map, VCR 
output or one of the 38 cameras -- thus keeping an eye on guard movement while simultaneously 
controlling your drone and synchronizing recordings to cameras. Whew, sounds like a lot of work? It 
is.

Halls of Montezuma (9847) (c) 1987 SSG Strategic Studies Group Pty Ltd. / SSG Strategic Studies Group 
Pty Ltd. 
 
The military is often painted in terms of precision.  Orders are expected to be followed exactly.  
But what happens when those giving the orders are blind?  Blindness is a fact of life for commanders, 
who have to wait for their men to call in with information.  This game puts the player in the shoes 
of a Corps commander—a man responsible for several divisions—for the lives of thousands of men.  The 
player will command some of the most famous battles in U.S. history, and will have to deal with the 
same lack of face-to-face contact that plagues every higher-level military leader. 
 
In this game the player replays historical battles in the wars with Mexico, World War I, World War II 
and the Korean War. 
 
Think for a moment about war from the perspective of the Marine.  Out in the field, their duty is to 
carry out orders to the best of their ability.  They must try to cope with the unexpected that 
interferes with their progress—weather, enemies, terrain, fatigue, lack of supplies... Unfortunately, 
it is a fact that there is a disconnect between soldiers in the field and the commanders in the 
command centers. Commanders don't have a personal connection to each person under them.  They rely on 
those underneath them to report in... 
 
This game gives some insight to the problems of command.  There are hundreds of units to keep track 
of, and the player needs a way to keep them organized.  The units become symbols on a map-board.  
Contact with the units is limited to the reports that they send back and the orders that the player 
sends out.  Once the orders are given, the situation is really out of your control.  Will they be 
able or willing to follow orders exactly?  What happens if they are interrupted by the enemy, by 
weather, by terrain.  Is the information on enemy movements accurate, or did the player just send a 
division (thousands of men) to their deaths? 
 
Most soldiers and Marines have never had the opportunity to see just what goes on inside the command 
centers, where the orders that they must follow come from.  This game recreates the command center.

Halls of the Things, The (3386) (c) 1984 Design Design / Crystal Computing 
 
Using the gaming engine and graphical style that would be seen again in The Warlock Of Firetop 
Mountain, Halls Of The Things places our adventurous hero in a randomly generated tower. A long 
hallway with seven doorways in it at the start offers the player the opportunity to enter dungeon 
areas of varying difficulty (easiest and more open at the top, hardest at the bottom). In these areas 
of the tower, the player can explore, finding treasure and elixir bottles (which can be used to 
replenish the player's magic). Of course, things aren't that simple. The Things roam the various 
corridors and will chase and attack the player on sight, even going so far as to disguise themselves 
as ordinary objects until the player comes in range. Fortunately, the player has sword and bow, as 
well as magical spells, to defend and heal himself. Will this be enough for you to raise a fortune in 
loot or will The Things see you to your doom?

Hammer Boy (3390) (c) 1991 Dinamic Software / Dinamic Software 
 
Hammer Boy is an average arcade game that plays like a cross between Kaboom! and Whack-a-mole. 
 
Armed with a big hammer, your job is to prevent the American Indians from reaching the tower behind 
your fort by hitting them on the head and putting out the fires that are thrown from the side. That's 
really it to the game -- new levels bring different backgrounds (battleship, castle and space base) 
with corresponding enemies (pirates, knights and aliens), but essentially the same gameplay. 
 
This game is based on the comic book hero.

In a grim future, the people are kept under control by a horde of genetically-modified beings who 
look identical to everyone else, and appear to act the same, but are subtly controlling minds and 
actions. This works perfectly for Centro-Holographis until two of their droids, Hammerfist (male) and 
Metalisis (female) malfunction. They try to put things right, and come under your control in this 
side-view action game with adventure elements. 
 
You can switch between the two characters at any moment, and must use this wisely as their abilities 
differ greatly. On each screen you must kill all enemies, as well as taking out the robots which keep 
the doors locked.

The great grand-daddy of all god games, HAMURABI puts the player in the shoes (well, sandals) of 
Hammurabi the Wise, ruler of ancient Sumeria.  Though this king is best known historically for his 
codification of laws and edicts, composed and engraved in cuneiform tablets ~1780 BC, the game veers 
away from lawmaking and the pursuit of justice in favour of guiding your population of subjects to 
stable, contented growth.  The game puts it, somewhat blandly, in other words: 
 
YOUR TASK IS TO DEVELOP A STABLE ECONOMY BY THE WISE MANAGEMENT OF YOUR RESOURCES. YOU WILL BE BESET 
FROM TIME TO TIME BY NATURAL EVENTS. 
Results of your actions are narrated to you in plain text

of your strike on a scale between 0 and 250. An additional variable affecting the outcome is the 
wind, which is displayed when you input your numbers. Each hole covers one screen and features woods, 
bunkers and dams. Being written in BASIC, Handicap Golf uses slowly drawn text characters for

Happiest Days of Your Life, The (3406) (c) 1986 Firebird Software Ltd. / Firebird Software Ltd. 
 
The Headmaster of a private school has his wallet stolen one day and blames one of the school boys 
for it. The school boy, who has the reputation of getting into trouble far too many times, must prove 
his innocence by exploring the school grounds and the nearby town, collecting items and taking them 
to the right place. 
Each location that the boy visits have names, with some of them providing a clue on the tasks that 
must be accomplished there. 
 
A wide variety of items can be collected, and these include a stereo, a cassette tape, a school tie, 
and a mortar board. Only two items can be carried at a time, and the boy can jump over certain items 
if he does not want to collect them. 
 
The school itself is empty, except for deadly objects that float around the room whenever the boy is 
present and prevent him from getting the required items. Contact with these objects drain the boy's 
energy, but this energy can be restored by getting food. Once his energy reaches zero, he loses one 
of his lives. If all his lives are lost, the boy faces expulsion.

without incurring damage, although falling off the bottom of the level costs you a life. Energy is 
lost through contact with the bacteria, and you have a limited supply of toothpaste, with a need to 
collect more as the game goes on. You can also collect enhanced weaponry such as double firing.

Hard Drivin' (3415) (c) 1989 Atari Games Corporation / Domark Software Ltd. 
 
Hard Drivin' is a 3D arcade hit from Atari Games. You are in control of a high-performance sports 
car. Your objective is to race around the course as fast as possible and hit as many checkpoints as 
possible. If you hit a checkpoint you gain extra time to go farther. You will see traffic on the road 
both in your direction and coming down the opposite direction, so be careful when you pass... 
 
The course has two sections: speed track, and stunt track. Speed track is longer, but you can usually 
achieve higher speeds. Stunt track requires you to perform several stunts such as jumping bridges, 
driving through a loop, and so on. 
 
Crashing the car has no serious consequences and indeed shows a replay of your crash from a cinematic 
angle. Admire your crash head-on into the cement truck, or clipping the minivan, or flying off the 
bridge in the wrong angle... You lose several seconds as your car is "reset" and you get up to speed 
again. 
 
The home conversions retain most of the then-advanced 3D graphics but lack the force-feedback that 
was in the arcade version.

Hawk Storm is a brave warrior living on the planet Edos, and its citizens look up to him for 
survival. Edos has only one source of energy: the giant capacitoid crystals, capable of storing 
energy by day and regenerate that energy during the icy cold nights. Having realized this, the evil 
Nevik warriors decided to steal all but two of these crystals, making it impossible to sustain normal 
life on the planet. As a result, all of the people are forced to go in a Life Suspension Program, 
except Hawk, who must recover all thirty-two stolen crystals if Edos is to survive. 
 
The Neviks are scattered throughout Edos to make sure that Hawk does not succeed in his quest, but 
Hawk can collect up to three different weapons – shields, mines, and stryders – that can be used 
against them. Also scattered around are various hazards such as firepits, slimeballs, spikes, and gun 
turrets, which can cause Hawk to lose some energy if he collides into them. There are several objects 
which Hawk can use to his advantage. Energy pods can restore his energy, lifts can be used to reach 
higher platforms, and teleports can take him to different areas.

responsibility of building up the squad by trading players and draft picks, selecting the offense, 
defence and kicker and calling the plays each week during the regular season games. Games are played 
out with simple graphics depicting rush, line plunge and pass plays as well as field goal attempts. 
Successful teams advance to the playoffs and possibly to the Super Bowl. An unusual feature is the 
College Draft in which draft picks were used to select new players for the next season. The master 
"Head Coach" would aim to win the trophy in three consecutive seasons on the highest level of the

Heartland (3462) (c) 1986 Odin Computer Graphics Ltd. / Odin Computer Graphics Ltd. 
 
Heartland's meta-referential plot involves a struggle between good and evil, as depicted in a book, 
the last six pages of which have become lost. As a result, you must dive into the game's world to 
complete the story, and ensure that evil doesn't win, by saving the white pages and destroying the 
black ones. 
 
There are six levels, all with distinctly cutesy themes and colourful graphics. The level layouts are 
extremely complicated, and you have to make your way back to base after each one, before being 
transported onto the next one, all within a time limit. The levels are full of wizards who must be 
shot, as well as a small amount of character interaction.

Heart of Africa (3460) (c) 1985 Ozark Softscape / Electronic Arts, Inc. 
 
In Heart of Africa, the unofficial follow-up to The Seven Cities of Gold, you play the part of an 
adventurer who is to continue a quest started by another explorer, Hiram Primm whose expedition has 
been reported missing while looking for  the  lost tomb of Pharaoh  Ahnk Ahnk. Find the tomb and you 
will stand to be the sole beneficiary to Primm’s estate. The only information that you have to go by 
is Primm’s unpublished paper on the legend of Ahnk-Ahnk and his African diary. 
 
The quest begins near a large port town and here you can find stores which will allow you to purchase 
items which are necessary like ropes and shovels. You start the quest with only $250. Use the map 
provided to find important landmarks and locations which the natives may name when giving you 
directions. The natives hold the key to your success. Not all natives behave the same to strangers. 
Offer them gold, copper, or other gifts to win their friendship. But be careful, not all natives see 
your offering as a sign of friendship. They each have their own cultures. Presenting them with the 
wrong gift may hinder your attempts to get needed information. 
 
Use the joystick to move about, press the fire button when you are standing still to move control to 
the four icons to the left of the exploration window. Click these icons for further options. The 
diary icon lets you page through your diary to review the clues that you get from the native chiefs. 
The map icon lets you see what you have explored so far. The options icon offers three choices. Two 
let you check on your location and condition. The third lets you drop things off to form a cache. The 
hand icon lets you select what you have in your hand and it lets you use items from your backpack. If 
you are delirious, your joystick control will become uncertain, reversed or randomized. 
 
Go to a pub in a port city to save your game. You can save up to 10 different games at once on a 
single disk. Each time that you start a new game, the location of the tomb and other valuables is 
subject to change.

Heatseeker (3465) (c) 1990 Thalamus Ltd / Thalamus Ltd 
 
On the planet Tantris are the Triphylios of Nem plants, which help keep the populous alive and the 
vast forests pure. But the increasing amount of industry has resulted in high levels of pollution, 
damaging the plants and killing off the forests. 
 
To deal with the forthcoming doom, the Gnostics constructed the Leg, a heat probe that has the 
capability of entering polluted areas, absorbing the heat of the Zeal smog flames, and giving that 
heat to the three plants. It can hop up plants and walls, and slide along the floor for faster 
movement. To defend itself from dangers – which include wildlife and acid rain - the Leg can shoot 
the Ball which it carries, or use a smart bomb if the going gets tough. Contact with any danger loses 
the Leg energy. Chalk can be collected which protects it from the acid rain. 
 
The Ball can also be thrown out to collect heat, which must be stored in the Leg so that it can be 
given to the three Triphylios plants. If it has stored enough energy, the plants open petals to block 
the acid rain. 
 
When the Ball has absorbed heat and it is returned to the Leg, the Leg gains energy and the pass 
counter gets boosted. When this counter reaches 9999, the Leg can teleport itself to the next jungle 
level where it is able to seek out more Zeal flames in order to save the Triphylios.

In a world called Boran, the evil sorcerer Kronos decides he has to put an end to King Aaron's rule. 
Aaron however is protected by the white mage Gandalf, who fights a terrible battle of magic against 
Kronos. At the end of the battle, both sorcerers are killed and Gandalf's staff is broken in two 
parts. Now Kronos' evil helper Hellowoon saw his chance at bringing the land under his control. He 
set up a reign of terror, but there was one more thing he needed: Zarrak, who is Aaron's son. 
 
The player assumes Zarrak's role, and the game begins with Zarrak waking up in a prison cell, bound 
by a chain to the wall. Hellowoon is a text-adventure, so all actions are controlled by words entered 
into the parser. Each room does however have its own graphical representation at the top of the 
screen. During the course of the game, the player may learn a total of three magical spells that can 
be used to defend themselves against foes.

You are in your car in the traffic jam in Helsinki, and you have one flat tyre. You must get as far 
as possible, accelerating slowly, but the flat tyre makes your car go to the left, so you must always 
compensate in order to stay in the correct lane. The outermost lane is the slowest, and you are 
advised only to go the left when you've gained enough speed not to be run into from behind. When 
you're at risk of running into slower cars, it's time to go left again. 
 
The minimal graphics and sound of Helsingfors can be explained by the fact that it is only 512 bytes 
big, ending up in the 14th place in the 512b category of the 2001 minigame coding contest.

HERO - Helicopter Emergency Rescue Operation (3508) (c) 1984 Activision, Inc. / Activision, Inc. 
 
There is trouble in the mines! Volcanic activity has trapped numerous miners, and it is your job to 
save them. As Roderick Hero, you need to make your way through the dangerous mineshaft avoiding the 
dangerous creatures and lava, and find out where the miners are located before you run out of energy. 
To help on your mission, Roderick Hero has several useful types of equipment. A prop pack will allow 
you to hover and fly around the mineshaft and (hopefully) avoid the many dangers within. Your helmet 
features a short range microlaser beam which can be used to destroy the bats, spiders, snakes, and 
other creatures you'll encounter in the mines. From time to time, your path through the mine may be 
blocked by stone or lava walls. You begin each mission with six sticks of dynamite which can be used 
to destroy these obstacles (be careful you don't blow yourself up, though!) If you run out of 
dynamite, your laser beam can also be used to destroy the walls, though this will take longer and use 
up more energy. As the levels progress, the mine shaft will become longer and more maze-like, 
creatures will more frequently block the path, and lava walls and pools will appear which are 
dangerous to the touch.

Hero of the Golden Talisman (3510) (c) 1985 Mr Chip Software / Mastertronic Ltd. 
 
The town of the game's hero is under a curse from an evil wizard. He has stolen the Golden Talisman 
that had protected the city in the past. Broken into five pieces, the Talisman is hidden in a 
labyrinth filled with monsters. Now the hero has to find all five pieces of the Talisman and destroy 
the evil wizard in order to restore peace to the city. 
 
The labyrinth is explored from a side scrolling perspective. It is composed of 64 room spread over 
five levels. Each room is 8 screens large, providing a total of 512 screens to explore. The goal of 
each level is to find a piece of the Talisman while fighting off lots of different monsters ranging 
from birds to jumping eyeballs to fire-breathing dragons. 
 
The hero can jump, climb ropes, swim and shoot as well as pick up different power-ups and objects. He 
can carry five objects, but only hold/use one at a time. Pressing the space bar changes the object in 
use. Usable objects include keys, ropes, lamps to light dark rooms, flags that improve the hero's 
firepower and others. 
 
Power-ups can be collected to replenish health or air. If the hero runs out of air, being underwater 
will slowly decrease his health. To help the hero finding his way through the labyrinth, a map is 
shown at the lower left side of the screen. It marks all visited rooms, shows his current position 
and indicates whether there are any items in a room.

Strict turn-based movement rules apply, as actions other than movement can only be carried out before 
or after the move, the size of which is limited by a dice roll. These moves are carried out using an 
icon-based system. Characters can fight the many monsters which lurk, or cast spells to vanquish 
them. There are magic potions to uncover, but also hidden traps, so mapping is advised. Treasure can 
be collected, and traded at the shop after each level.

Hero Quest II - Return of the Witchlord (3512) (c) 1991 Gremlin Graphics Software Ltd. / Gremlin 
Graphics Software Ltd. 
 
A Hero Quest expansion pack with a set of new quests (adapted from a similar expansion to the 
original board game). This time the quests follow an ongoing storyline. The Witch Lord is back, and 
the heroes enter the ruined city Kalos to find and defeat him. Return of the Witch Lord plays 
similarly to the original game, but as the manual warns, is more difficult. 
 
For the DOS version of the game, the expansion pack was only available through the Hero Quest + Hero 
Quest: Return of the Witch Lord bundle.

Six different track and field disciplines are recreated in this multi-event sports simulation. Up to 
six human players can take them on.You can replay each attempt, or watch simulated recording of the 
world record distances and speeds of the day, for training purposes. 
 
100m sprint and 110m hurdles have a similar joystick waggling technique, but time the jumps over the 
hurdles accurately. The long jump is also waggling-based, with the joystick being pushed up to launch 
the jump and ensure a correct landing. 
 
In diving you can choose the jump to attempt, with more difficult ones worth more points if you get 
it right. In archery you shoot at four circles of differing distances several times, aiming to get as 
close to the centre as possible. This is done by holding down fire to prepare the arrow, and push 
down to release the bow. Weightlifting involves the snatch and clean-and-jerk phases, with the latter 
involving more joystick presses to keep the weights under control.

Hideous Bill & the Gi-Gants (3529) (c) 1983 Virgin Games, Ltd. / Virgin Games, Ltd. 
 
Bill must save his girlfriend Greta from the gi-gants, giant ants who plan to turn her into ant food. 
The game is divided into three levels, with the objective being in each level to crush all the ant 
eggs in order to proceed to the next level. Three gi-gants roam around each level trying to destroy 
Bill. Warp tunnels are located on the left and right sides of each level, and these can be used to 
get to either side quickly. 
 
Besides crushing eggs, objects scattered around the level that can be put to good use. In level one, 
Bill can collect spears which he can use to slay a gi-gant, but Whatever gi-giant gets destroyed will 
be replaced by an egg in the center of the maze, and this egg will hatch to reveal another gi-gant. 
In level two, there are no weapons but a passage in the center, whose doors can be activated by 
placing two levers into holes near the passage. The passage can be used to trap gi-gants, making 
Bill's task easier. Inside the passage is a can of beans that are used to break down walls in level 
three, and it is this level where Bill can finally rescue his true love.

High Frontier (3533) (c) 1987 Software Studios / Activision (UK) Limited 
 
When High Frontier was created, America was investing heavily in the original 'Star Wars' SDI, to 
fend off a feared Soviet missile attack. Your job in this strategy game is to oversee its 
development. 
 
The game is played via an icon control system, with a common set of icons and information panels are 
displayed around these screens. There are six distinct screens used to make the decisions, plus the 
ability to track existing satellites and keep track of active Soviet attacks. 
 
The Research & Development screen is the first port of call. It is split into six components, to 
which you must assign money and staff. The President will give the order to arm or disarm your units 
(including the activation code). Once you have working SDIs and the permission codes, you can launch 
them using the Shield screen. 
 
Espionage and Reconnaissance cameras are located to keep track of enemy development, although these 
figures are not always precise. The Threats screen lets you keep track of enemy resources and moods. 
The World screen effectively moves the game forward in time.

Highlander (3542) (c) 1986 Canvas / Ocean Software Ltd. 
 
The 1986 cult film Highlander is the basis of this adaptation, which reduces the film to its 
swordfighting scenes. Taking the role of the immortal Highlander Connor MacLeod, the player has to 
win three consecutive battles against increasingly skilled opponents: MacLeod's teacher Ramirez, a 
character named Fizir, and finally the mighty Kurgan, the main antagonist of the movie. 
 
A battle is won by depleting the enemy of his energy. Energy is lost by being hit, or by attempting 
an attack that is blocked by the enemy. To win, a combination of attacking and parrying moves is 
necessary, of which several are available depending on the character's stance (standing or crouched) 
and the direction the joystick is pushed. 
 
Two players can engage in a duel in two-player mode.

A sheriff must defend his town against outlaws, who are about to abduct women from “Saucy Sue's 
Saloon” or rob the local bank. To defend it, the sheriff is equipped with his gun, which is used to 
shoot one of the outlaws. Shooting can be done in a horizontal, vertical, or diagonal direction. 
There are five waves to complete, and the outlaws get tougher after each level, with outlaws riding 
horses, blowing up sticks of dynamite, and hiding behind windows. In Wave 5, the sheriff is out of 
town and finds himself outside the entrance of the cave where outlaws emerge from. 
 
In Waves 1 through 4, when an outlaw is killed, the undertaker will come out from “Rig + Mortis 
Undertakers” and collects any bodies found lying around. After each wave, there is a bonus duel 
between the sheriff and the outlaw. The sheriff must quickly open fire before the outlaw.

High Rollers (9781) (c) 1988 Box Office, Inc. / Box Office, Inc. 
 
The game is a computer adaptation of an American TV game show, where two competitors should win a 
game and money, throwing dices, eliminating certain numbers and answering trivial questions. 
 
The gameplay flows in real-time mode. For each roll of the dice a question must be answered. The 
first player should  press his/her keys to have a chance to answer the question. If the first player 
to hit their key answers correctly, then he or she have control of the dice and may decide whether to 
roll them or pass them to the other player. If however the first player to answer answers 
incorrectly, then the other player has control of the dice and may roll or pass. 
 
In the one player game, you compete against the computer. In novice mode the computer plays less 
intelligently than in expert mode and responds incorrectly to questions more often.  The two player 
game follows the same format as one player game, but with both human opponents playing at hot-seat. 
 
The object of the game is to clear the columns of numbers thus winning the money total at the bottom 
of the column (if you win the game). In order to take numbers off the board you must answer a 
question correctly or be passed the dice. You roll the dice trying not to roll a total that doesn't 
equal some of the remaining numbers on the board. For example if there are only three numbers left on 
the board it is probably a good idea to pass the dice since there are quite a few illegal rolls. For 
every Doubles you roll, you get an insurance marker which allows you to roll illegally without losing 
the game (but only once). You can take off 1,2,3 or 4 numbers from the board at one time. 
 
Winning the competition, Bonus Round will be proposed to a player. Its idea is to clear all of the 
numbers off of the board, without rolling an illegal combination (without an insurance marker). If a 
player achieves the goal, he/she get an additional $10,000! After a player completes the bonus round 
he/she become the current champion and subsequent players must play him/her until they defeat 
him/her. But the current champion does not appear in the High Rollers Champions file until he/she 
loses. 
 
Hi-scores are written in Top Ten Table.

Play a would-be hero in the city of Hillsfar, where action and adventure await the daring adventurer. 
Join the local guild and complete missions from the guild master in a quest for glory and gold! 
 
Hillsfar is a "single-hero" role playing game (in comparison to other Advanced Dungeons & Dragons 
RPGs, where the player usually controls a group of characters). A combination of 1st person 
perspective (when traveling in the city of Hillsfar) and 3rd person perspective (usually in some 
action-style mini-quests) viewpoints. 
 
As a would-be-hero, four classes are available in a randomly generated mission-based plot: Thief, 
Mage, Fighter or Cleric. Each class, to a certain extent, has a different approach for completing 
quests. 
 
In Hillsfar, gameplay usually consists of various "mini-games" that are needed to complete the quests 
or missions provided at the local guild by the guild master. These mini-games include, but are not 
limited to: 
 
1. Fighting at the Arena (3rd Person Perspective) 
Competing at the Archery Range (1st Person Perspective) 
Exploring buildings or mazes (Top-down Perspective) 
Riding a horse while avoiding obstacles (3rd Person Perspective/Side-Scrolling) 
Locking picking doors and chests (1st Person Perspective) 
 
Unlike most RPGs, there isn't any "randomly generated monster combat" in Hillsfar. RPG combat only 
occurs in the Arena.

away lands to find the fleece. Many characters from ancient mythology will be encountered along the 
way, including King Neptune, the Sirens, Cyclops, and others. You need to find a way past them as 
well as the many obstacles on sea and land if you are to be successful. Along the bottom of the 
screen is a text parser which accepts two word commands to interact with the game, and at the top 
(covering most of the screen) are graphics depicting your current situation. If needed, the graphics 
can temporarily be cleared to see some of the most recent commands entered.

Hole-In-One Miniature Golf (c) 1988 DigiTek Software|Magic Bytes / Gremlin Graphics Software Ltd. 
 
Hole-In-One Miniature Golf provides an overhead view of each hole. The game play is controlled 
entirely with the mouse. You place the ball on the starting pad and click the left mouse button. Once 
you have placed the ball, "stretch" a line from the ball to the pointer. The direction the line is 
pointing is the direction the ball will go. The length of the line or the distance between the 
pointer and the ball is relative to the power on the shot. Once you are satisfied, click the left 
mouse button to putt the ball. 
 
You are allowed to go three shots over par. Any more than that and you will get a penalty stroke and 
must advance to the next hole (or player). You can also get one stroke penalty for going into a water 
hazard. Your scorecard will be displayed after the first nine holes but can be viewed at anytime 
using the Options Menu. After completing the course the scorecard will be displayed again. You can 
print your scores or exit to continue. 
 
The game features five complete 18-hole courses with different themes including a Tutorial Course 
that walks the player through every aspect of game play, a Classics Course which is patterned after 
the basic traditional miniature golf course, an Intermediate Course that adds more obstacles, 
elevations and difficulty, an adventurous Fantasy Course with designs ranging from castles to pinball 
and the Expert Course for those who master the game. The game can be installed on a hard drive.

(From The Infocom Homepage Entry) 
 
As a child, you spent most of your summers with your Aunt Hildegarde and Uncle Buddy. What memories! 
Uncle Buddy was a Hollywood big-shot, Aunt Hildegarde his loving (and very rich) wife. They had no 
children of their own, but you and your cousins loved their house, their parties, the Hollywood 
memorabilia, and them. Sure, Buddy and Hildy were a bit eccentric -- but that added to their charm. 
 
Aunt Hildegarde kept the house when Uncle Buddy passed away. And now that she's suddenly died, you 
remember her unusual will. You will inherit the entire estate -- probably worth millions if you can 
spend just one night in the house and on the grounds, find a treasure or two. But if you can't then 
you inherit nothing. 
 
And so Hollywood Hijinx begins with you being dropped off in front of a dark house, not to far from 
Hollywood ...

1. No If's, And's or Bus: Ralph Kramden is a bus driver and must pick up as many passengers and 
   take them to their destinations. The game is played as an overhead view over a map of steet names 
   and passangers. The goal is to pick up waiting passangers and deliver them to the destination they 
   want. The player only controls the bus's direction (up, down, left, right) and speed. Delivering 
   passengers earns points but leaving passengers on the bus will lose points. Hitting other traffic 
   or returning to the bus depot will end the game. 
2. Sewer I Do: Ed Norton works for the sewer company and has a map of the tunnels' layout. However 
   his map has blown away so he must navigate the sewers from memory, fixing leaks and eventually 
   returning to his ladder. The game is played in first-person 3D maze with the player being able to 
   move forward, back and rotate left and right. 
3. Going to Pieces: Alice Kramden works at a department store and is talking to Trixie when she 
   drops a jig-saw puzzle. The player must reassemble the image before time runs out. 
4. Additionally, "The $99,000 Answer" is Ralph's favorite game show, sometimes appears at the end 
   of mini-games as a double-or-nothing bonus round. Players must answer trivia questions related to 
   The Honeymooners TV show. However game shows are all about luck and sometimes the player will win 
   or lose randomly without a question being asked.

Hong Kong Phooey (3575) (c) 1990 PAL Developments / Hi-Tec Software Ltd. 
 
A very straightforward adventure platform game where you play as Hong Kong Phooey himself to help 
fight crime. In this game Baron Von Bankjob has escaped from jail and it is up to Hong Kong Phooey to 
find him. The game starts off with the trademark scene of Hong Kong Phooey jumping out of his file 
cabinet as seen on the animated TV show. From there on you must maneuver yourself through each of the 
levels full of obstacles like the Baron's thugs, collapsing platforms, conveyor belts, oil and acid 
patches. Hong Kong Phooeys health is displayed via the "Hong Kong Phooey Book of Kung Fu" meter 
located on the bottom left of the screen. Collect drinks to help replenish your health, unlock doors 
and activate switches to help advance further into the level to find Baron Von Bankjob and bring him 
to justice.

Hook (3577) (c) 1992 Shadow Software / Ocean Software Ltd. 
 
In this video game adaption of the Steven Spielberg film Hook, the player takes the role of a 
grown-up Peter Pan, whose kids have been kidnapped by Captain Hook. Tinker Bell takes Peter back to 
Neverland where he must again become Pan and reclaim his children. 
 
This particular interpretation is a side-scrolling action game, in which players must hack their way 
past Hook's denizens through 11 levels.  These include forests, icy regions, and towns which Peter 
will have to jump, climb, and swim through. Magic items such as apples and pixie dust can be 
collected for special powers. When enemies are attacked, they simply put their hands up in surrender 
rather than dying, so as to make the game more child-friendly.

Hoppin' Mad (3588) (c) 1988 Elite Systems Ltd. / Elite Systems Ltd. 
 
The player controls four bouncing balls that must make their way through twelve environments ranging 
from park to desert and beach to undersea world, collecting up to ten balloons in each. Each one of 
the balls must deal with several hazards, by jumping over them or crushing them. Collision with any 
of these will cause a ball to burst. 
 
The player can speed up or slow down the balls, or control their height, to make it easy to avoid 
these hazards. If all four balls have been punctured, the player loses a life. Once all ten balloons 
have been collected, the player is transported to the next environment, and when they have managed to 
get through all twelve environments, the player is transported back to the first environment.

A more accurate title for this would be "Horace Goes Skiing, but only if he can brave a Frogger clone

to reach the slopes. The road is full of cars and bikes, contact with each of which costs $10 in 
ambulance fees out of your starting $40, and the skis themselves cost $10. 
 
The actual skiing section has a pseudo-3D view, similar to a roving camera mounted above the course. 
Your task is to cut between the red and blue sets of flags, without hitting any of the trees on the 
course. Light contact with these will allow you to carry on

Hot Rod (3600) (c) 1990 SEGA Corporation / Activision, Inc. 
 
Hot Rod is a top-view racing game influenced by Super Sprint, in which three miniature cars race to 
complete a race as quickly as possible, by rotating, accelerating and braking at the right moments. 
You start with limited fuel, but more can be collected as you cover the track. Hitting hazards can 
cause your car to explode, thus costing time as it is replaced. 
 
Unusually the racetracks are linear rather than lap-based, so each round involves covering a section 
of track once. After each race, you can purchase upgrades at the shop, depending on how much money 
you earned in the previous race. 
 
Only part of the circuit is shown at a time, and this scrolls following the leader. If you fail to 
keep up with this, your car is moved forward on the track, with a penalty fuel deduction. This is 
slightly similar to the system later used in head-to-head games of Micro Machines, and is especially 
punishing while you are on roads travelling horizontally and the leading CPU car is travelling 
vertically, as it makes the margin for error much smaller.

Hotshot (16017) (c) 1988 Maxwell Technology Ltd. / Prism Leisure Corporation Plc 
 
A simple two-player game released to much marketing fanfare, Hotshot places you and another player 
(either another person or an AI robot) in an arena split down the middle into two save for a hole 
about half the screen's height for the ball to travel through, with a series of bricks on each side 
to destroy. 
 
The aim of the game is to destroy your own bricks before your opponent can destroy his. This is 
achieved by catching the small by pointing your suction device at it and holding fire, and then 
releasing in the needed by letting go of the button. This is easier said than done, as the ball 
neither moves in a straight line or according to the natural rules of.gravity. 
 
Should either player be hit with the ball and not catch it properly, they will be knocked down and 
possession of the ball is passed to the other player.

gate-crashed a party full of sophisticated well-behaved types, you must do everything you can to be 
seen as hateful, yobbish and immature – a Complete Bastard. 
 
The house has several rooms, each of which are filled with objects which are of use, as well as 
unlimited supplies of food, alcohol and coffee, which control how drunk you are at a time – some 
awful actions force you to be sober, others force you to be drunk. The game also displays whether you 
need the toilet (or, more accurately, any part of the house that would cause offence), whether you 
need to fart, and how strong-smelling these are. 
 
The rooms can all be viewed from multiple angles, and 2 can be viewed at a time through a 
split-screen view. 
 
To win, you need to prove to all 16 party guest that you are a complete bastard.

Hunchback (3637) (c) 1983 Century Electronics / Ocean Software Ltd. 
 
Victor Hugo never could have expected that his creation Quasimodo, the Hunchback of Notre Dame, would 
run such an obstacle course as is dished up in this game, dodging fireballs and arrows while leaping 
over pits and pikemen, sometimes with the help of a swinging bell-pull rope, in hopes of rescuing his 
beloved Esmeralda from the top tower -- all while being slow-but-steady chased across the castle 
parapets by an invincible knight in full armour.  Once you get the hang of any individual obstacle, 
the game starts throwing them at you in tandem, until toward the end you're tracking the swing of the 
rope, the thrust of the lance, the approach of the arrow and the advance of the knight all 
simultaneously!  Succeed, against all odds, and you get to do it again, but faster!  Even an 
able-bodied protagonist would have a hard time juggling all these threats, but I have a feeling a 
dedicated player with patience and good timing can overcome them.  Let's call it a hunch.

Hunchback at the Olympics (3639) (c) 1985 Seatongrove Ltd. / Software Projects Ltd. 
 
The Games of the XXIII Olympiad were held in Los Angeles in 1984 and for the first time since the 
advent of the video game industry, this king of sporting competitions was to be held in a first-world 
nation.  In simpler times, this might have inspired people to head out to a track or gymnasium to try 
their stuff, but now for the first time an industry was poised to let the hands of the middle-class 
masses do all the work virtually, through joysticks, needing no facilities or specialised equipment 
(beyond a video game console) to try the whole gamut of events. 
 
Since numerous companies realised this around the same time, from a marketing perspective, the only 
serious question is: what's going to make your Olympiad game stand out from the rest?  Will you have 
an expensive celebrity endorsement by a Gold medal-winner?  Will you implement the flags and national 
anthems of all participating countries?  Perhaps you've been beaten to the punch.  Well, here's a 
tack no one has considered yet -- have the player control the Hunchback of Notre Dame, as he shambles 
faster, higher and stronger toward Olympic gold!  He's an established hero of video games plus his 
public domain status makes him cheaper to use than, say, Sam the Eagle, the mascot of the 1984 Summer 
Games. 
 
I don't know what elapsed at that board meeting, but the pitch was green-lighted, and so we ended up 
with a game in which our unlikely hero Quasimodo is guided, through dedicated joystick-wiggling, 
through the 100m sprint, long jump, shot put, discus throw, javelin throw, 110m hurdles and high 
jump, all in hopes to impress Esmeralda, the object of his affection.  It's a far cry from the 
belfries and gargoyles of the cathedral of Notre Dame de Paris, but perhaps the change of scenery 
will do him some good.

Hunchback II - Quasimodo's Revenge (3640) (c) Nov, 1984 Ocean Software Ltd. / Ocean Software Ltd. 
 
The archetype of the Hunchback of Notre Dame really isn't terribly nuanced: he jumps around towers, 
ringing bells, rescuing Esmeralda and being generally physically unattractive.  Here he does all of 
these things, in a more platform-oriented take than the original, clambering up dangling ropes as 
they rise and fall, avoiding environmental threats such as rabid bats, thrown hatchets and enormous 
grinding clockwork gears all in the pursuit of small bells strewn across each screen's platforms.  
Gathering all the bells permits you to advance higher up the tower, at the top of which the damsel in 
distress awaits your homely visage.

Hunchback - The Adventure (3638) (c) 1986 Ocean Software Ltd. / Ocean Software Ltd. 
 
As they went on to demonstrate with Nightbreed, Ocean wasn't afraid to try a few different approaches 
to licensed material once they'd gotten their mitts on it, which is how you explain following up not 
one but two run-and-jump platform games with a text adventure game -- the change in approach a breath 
of fresh air and, perhaps, a response to critics suggesting that rehashing the same old thing is 
getting tired and stale. 
 
Many arcade games of the period would have a hard time with the transition, lacking enough of a 
skeleton of plot to flesh out with characters and events, but the Hunchback franchise has always 
enjoyed descent from one of the greatest works of French fiction (not incidentally long since in the 
public domain, hence ripe for free squeezing), Victor Hugo's Notre-Dame de Paris... even if it hadn't 
made terribly extensive use of its heritage up to this title. 
 
You are still Quasimodo, deformed ward of the Church, and you still quest for the favour and 
well-being of gypsy Esperalda, but for once you don't do so by jumping over pits and ducking under 
arrows (and, uh, participating in organised sporting events)!  Instead, you navigate sites in, around 
and under Paris, including the Cathedral of Notre Dame, collecting inventory items to use to solve 
puzzles and overcome minions of the Bishop and Cardinal -- foes who no longer cause you to lose a 
life at the merest contact. 
 
The narrative does sustain a bit of garbling along the way in the transition from high literature to 
action arcade game and back to crypto-literary interactive fiction, but they take what they've 
learned about design along the way and present things clearly, possessions and companions continually 
visually indicated above a baroque text input/output field.  The interface is as intuitive as those 
of the prior games in the franchise, despite the enormous gulf between their respective styles of 
gameplay.  Now you can give your twitchy fingers a rest and let your brain take over for a while.

Hunchy (3641) (c) 1986 
 
An unlicensed Hunchback clone, this one stays close to its source material, having you make Quasimodo 
run and jump through a medieval side-scrolling set in order to rescue Esmeralda.  Though it's lacking 
the Tarzan-like rope-swinging and the pursuing soldier who enforces the time limit in other versions, 
its 25 levels boast an ample set of conventional Hunchbackian threats -- rolling rocks and guards' 
thrusting pikes to jump over, arrows to duck under, and an exceptional menace relatively unknown in 
medieval Paris: ominous drops of acid rain.  As you proceed you will get to risk them one at a time, 
and eventually, following the classic Hunchback formula, all together.

Hungry Horace (3643) (c) 1983 Psion Software Ltd. / Melbourne House 
 
This was one of the Spectrum’s earliest Pac-Man-influenced games, taking place on a quick succession 
of small levels. The level designs have a lot of complex corridors and side-lines, as well as at 
least one wrap-around section and one tunnel – the ghosts may well be waiting for you at the end of 
this. Each level features one power-pill to put to use, and an increasing number of enemies as you 
progress. Unlike most games of the style, after collecting all the dots you must progress through an 
exit at the right of the screen, so it might be worth planning your path through the dots so as to 
finish near this.

Hunter's Moon (3649) (c) 1987 Thalamus Ltd / Thalamus Ltd 
 
Your Hunter starship has been sucked into a black hole, and emerged in a region filled with hives of 
re-spawning cells, most of which have a portal in the middle. Viewed from above, you will have to 
shoot your way past the hives and into the portals. 
 
There are 16 systems, each split into between 4 and 9 levels, and each of these has a number of 
hives. These are highlighted on a radar at the bottom of the screen, and one of them flashes. If you 
fly into this one first within a time limit, you will automatically complete the level. Otherwise, 
you will have to fly into them all. 
 
Avoid crashing into the hives, and watch out for the white worker cell, which moves around replacing 
destroyed hives - contact with this is fatal.

Hypa-Ball (3656) (c) 1986 
 
Hypaball is a two player futuristic sports game, played between the Hawks (human) and the Vipers 
(human or CPU). Choose your three-man team from a pool of 10 players, each with slightly different 
stats for strength, agility and speed. 
 
The teams have to pass and catch a ball and shoot it to a moving basket in the middle of the screen. 
Two players are in the air (one in each half of the arena), while the third remains on the ground to 
collect an otherwise-dead ball. You simultaneously control the grounder and the air player nearer the 
ball - they move left and right in unison, but only the air player responds to up-down movements. 
Players can only hold possession for 2.5 seconds, in order to keep the games fast and frantic.

Hyperbowl (3668) (c) 1987 Binary Design, Ltd. / Mastertronic Ltd. 
 
Hyperbowl is a one-on-one futuristic sport viewed from above, with a small amount of the rectangular 
pitch visible at a time.  Each player controls one of the 10 available spaceships, each with their 
own subtle strengths and weaknesses in terms of speed, inertia and fire direction. A scanner shows 
the positions of both ships and the ball, so that things don't become disorientating. 
 
The aim is to guide the ball either into a 'goal' in the middle of each end (scoring 2 points) or 
onto the goal-line elsewhere (scoring one point). The ball can be steered either by hitting it with 
the ship or by shooting at it with your craft's beam (which does not injure or impede the opposition 
craft in any way). In either case the ball moves in a semi-random direction similar to the one you 
directed it in, but can rebound off the plus-shaped divots in the wall unexpectedly. 
 
The game lasts for 5 minutes, or until a player reaches the winning score of 9. Each of the three 
skills levels is a 5-tier tournament of increasing difficulty.

Six tough events await in this joystick-waggling action game. The full sequence of events is - 
swimming, skeet shooting, gymnastics, archery, triple jumping and weightlifting. You must complete 
each event in order to be allowed onto the next one. 
 
Swimming involves moving left and right as fast as possible, while pressing fire when a breath is 
required. Skeet shooting and archery both come down to timing - though elevation and wind factors 
affect the latter. Gymnastics involves timing a succession of presses to ensure that the jump is long 
and the landing graceful. The triple jump involves one press for each part of the jump, whereas the 
weightlifting involves merely brute strength.

Ian Botham's Test Match (3684) (c) 1984 
 
Ian Botham's Test Match is a one or two player cricketing game that can be played using a keyboard or 
a joystick. 
 
There are three game modes, a limited over game, a one day match or a test match, each option taking 
progressively longer to complete. 
The player can choose between the 'armchair cricket' mode where the game supplies names for all team 
members, or the 'personal team selection' mode where the player enters their own teams names. 
 
At the start of the game the player is presented a cricket pitch, on which the bowler, the wicket 
keeper together and two opposing batsmen are already positioned. 
The player then positions nine fielders around the pitch ready for the first over. Fielders are 
placed by moving the fielder icon around the pitch with the arrow keys and pressing 'Fire' when the 
player is in the correct position. 
 
Bowling : Before any over commences the player selects the type of bowler, this can be fast, medium, 
spin, or bouncer. Once this is done the player presses the 'Fire' key and the game positions the 
bowler behind the wicket, he takes a run up and delivers a ball. This is repeated until the over is 
complete. 
 
Batting : In a single player game the computer will start as the batting team. 
When the player is batting they must select where they wish to hit the ball that's just been bowled. 
This is done by holding down the 'Fire' key while pressing the numeric keys to select a direction. 
Directions can be changed at will right up until the time the 'Fire' key is released. The ball should 
be struck at the last possible moment for 
maximum strength. 
 
Fielding : Once the ball has been batted the player has the chance to select a fielder to chase the 
ball to try to prevent it reaching the boundary. If the ball touches the running fielder or any of 
the stationary fielders, it is either caught or thrown at the wicket to attempt to run the batsman 
out. Fielders may be repositioned at the start of each over. Dismissal appeals for, say 
leg-before-wicket (LBW), is not automatic as appeals may be rejected by the umpire.

Ice Guys (3687) (c) 1997 Knights of Bytes / Protovision 
 
Last winter, there was a day when more snow fell than ever before. That's why people all over the 
world took the day off, went outside and built snowmen with their kin. It seemed to be a day full of 
laughter and happiness when suddenly some nasty creatures appeared who couldn't stand the joy. They 
scared off the happy folks and took all the snowmen away. With the smiling fellows missing, sadness 
was to conquer the empty places. 
 
Two former antarctic explorers who retired some time ago to open an ice cream parlor stood up against 
the nasty creatures. They decided to take the challenge, chase the creatures through the world's 
cities and bring back every single snowman! 
 
Ice Guys is a platform game with cartoon graphics. One solo player or two team mates fight against a 
horde of little monsters. Their only weapon against the creatures is the snow on the ground - but 
there is plenty of it! So they keep throwing snowballs at their attackers to get them caught in an 
avalanche. The avalanche can be kicked thus turning it into a deathly bowling ball. Combination hits 
will be rewarded with goodies which can be collected. Diamonds can be traded for special items in a 
shop. Stars will qualify the players for a sleigh race bonus game and ice creams will eventually be 
turned into extra lives. 
 
There are 4 cities to visit. Each comes with a different graphical setting and 8 screens to solve. 
The further the players progress in the game, the cleverer and nastier the monsters get. When all 32 
levels are finished, an ending sequence closes the game.

You want to become a special agent for I.C.U.P.S. (International Commission for Universal Problem 
Solving), but before they can accept you, you have to pass two tests that make up two different parts 
of the game. 
 
The first part is shown from a top-down perspective. You are in control of a space ship and are under 
attack from different kinds of enemies. Most enemy ships are not lethal in themselves, but have 
either the ability to shoot up, down, or sideways. To defeat them, you can shoot upwards or push them 
towards the edge of the screen. 
 
The second part of the game is shown from a side-scrolling perspective and begins once you reach the 
enemy star ship. In it, you control a robot with a jet-pack and must find four parts of a bomb that 
are scattered throughout the large ship, while shooting lots of insect-like enemies.

Ikarus (3712) (c) 1991 Masters' Design Group / Double Density 
 
Ikarus is a Joust clone in which players control a phoenix and must try to hit their opponent from a 
higher position. Pressing the fire-button causes the phoenix to flap its wings and fly upwards. Only 
when the phoenix is flapping its wings can players influence the direction of its flight. 
Successfully hitting an opponent from a higher position scores one point. The first player to score 
ten points wins the game. 
 
Apart from a two-player-mode there is also a single-player quest mode, featuring ten levels with 
increasingly difficult opponents.

Imperium Galactum (3726) (c) 1984 Strategic Simulations, Inc. / Strategic Simulations, Inc. 
 
Not to be confused with the much, much later Imperium Galactica, this was the first fully-functional 
commercial "4X" space game to hit the U.S. Many of the most important features in later 4X games 
appeared in this one: ship design, guerrilla warfare on captured planets, troop transports. It did 
not feature tactical space battles, however. 
 
The main game screen displayed a grid of dots, with star systems shown by a larger circle with a 
color representing the star's type. Stars could have zero, one, or two inhabitable planets. Warships 
could be custom designed and were tracked individually with a maximum of 255 war ships per player in 
existence at one time. Transports could carry either colonists and troops and traders carried metal 
or food surpluses to where they were needed. During an invasion, the respective armies from each 
player would fight until one force was destroyed. However, planets thus captured could suffer from 
guerrilla resistance for several turns and if not eradicated could overthrow the invaders or assist 
your opponent's armies in the event of a counter invasion. 
 
Given the tiny systems it ran on, this game did a very good job of simulating many important 
considerations, and was the first introduction of some of the things that have become staples in 4X 
space games

Impossamole (3730) (c) 1990 Core Design Ltd. / Gremlin Graphics Software Ltd. 
 
Monty Mole has been living in luxury since his previous adventures, but he has now been beamed up by 
an alien race who want him to do a job for them. Monty must trek through five worlds to retrieve the 
sacred scrolls of the race's Guardians. 
 
As with Core's previous hit Rick Dangerous 2 there is versatility in the exact structure of the game. 
The first four consist of the Orient, a Klondike mine, an Ice world and an Amazon forest - once these 
are completed the final world is open to you. 
 
The platform-based gameplay is similar to Monty's earlier games, with primarily horizontal progresses 
as well as ropes and ladders to navigate. Monty has developed a useful flying kick, and has been 
given a smart bomb, with the potential to collect extra bombs and guns. Hazards, enemies and level 
designs are themed around each level, and range from cable cars and falling snowballs to Ninjas and 
Monkeys.

In 80 Days Around the World (3735) (c) 1987 Fantastic Software / Rainbow Arts Software GmbH 
 
Based on a tale first scripted by Jules Verne. You start as Phileas Fogg in the Reform Club of London 
where Fogg boasts that he is able to traverse the world in 80 days. The nobs of the Reform Club force 
him to bet all he owns: 20.000 GBP. Together with your Butler Passepartout you set off on 2nd October 
to your great adventure. 
 
Half the time of the game you play as Phileas Fogg, half the time as Butler Passepartout. The screen 
shows a world map, a puffing train in the corner indicates the speed level you travel, a money bag 
indicates your finances and 2 buttons exist where you can bribe (to speed up the train) and play 
cards (to increase your financials). Action parts are arcade-styled, normally side-scrolling 
platform-action in which you have to collect items for your further travel. The first 
action-adventure parts starts in India, where you  control Passepartout running through the Jungle to 
a temple where you have to collect something for your further adventures. While running through the 
jungle, Indians drop things on you and throw  spears after you. You must beware of fall traps and 
make the exit in time or your adventure is over. 
 
Your next stop take place in Japan - here you have to catch acrobats on your shoulders. Next action 
part in America: Beware of dodging wolves! Afterwards you must copy the dance of an indian 
medicine-man if you don't want to end as an Indian snack... Finally after returning to England you 
have to master the Dungeons of London. Are you able to return within 80 days to the Reform Club?

The Incredible Shrinking Sphere of the title comes under your control in this isometric maze game 
which has similarities to Marble Madness and Spindizzy. The ball needs to be guided from the start of 
a level to the end, through 4 linked sections. 
 
Various functioning squares must be used to your advantage. Uniquely these include changes to the 
ball's size, as well as it's physics. Revolving squares randomly fire the ball off in another 
direction, and ramps shoot you in the current direction at high speed. Weapons can be collected, as 
can shields - both of which are required to avoid some of the hazards on show. Black holes are always 
fatal however.

Indiana Jones and the Fate of Atlantis (3749) (c) 1992 Attention to Detail Limited / LucasArts|U.S.

Being an action title, the game starts off where Indy is about to have an excuse to use his trusty 
whip: in Monte Carlo, after he recruited headstrong former student Sophie to his aid and determined 
the location of ancient discs needed to open the door to the lost city of Atlantis. Most action takes 
place in isometric view, although there are some variations along the way to keep up interest. There 
are even some adventure-game elements, such as Indy's inventory which you can fill with various 
objects to use (i.e. money to buy things). They are mostly easy though, and are there only to relieve 
the tension from knuckle-blistering action.

As in the movie (and the more famous graphic adventure), your task is to find the Holy Grail. Before 
this can be done you must find the Cross of Coronado, a shield and a diary. 
 
This makes for a four-level arcade adventure combining climbs, exploration (with several routes 
through each level, and some traps) and puzzles. Indy is armed with his trusty whip to fight off 
foes, but can also get involved in hand-to-hand combat. The first level takes place in caves 
underneath Colorado, before you reach a moving circus train strewn with traps, a Zeppelin which is 
full of guards and ladders, and then Castle Grunwald in Austria.

The computer versions of Indiana Jones and the Temple of Doom are conversions of the Atari arcade 
game based on the second movie in the series. As Indy you must complete several cycles of the 
following 3 types of levels:Mine level: Whip your way through a mine in order to free children that 
are held captive. Use your whip to swing across chasms, climb ladders, ride along conveyor belts and 
defend yourself against attacks from Thuggee guards, bats, snakes and the fireball-throwing Mola ram. 
Escape with the mine cart after you've freed all children. 
2. Mine cart level: Pick the right route through a network of tracks while riding in a mine cart. 
   Avoid potholes, broken tracks & guards in carts and safely reach the end of the track. 
3. Temple level: Make your way to the altar and grab the Sankara stone while Mola Ram, bats and 
   Thuggee guards attack you. Watch out for that lava. 
With every cycle the mine & mine cart levels become more complex, the layout of the temple levels is 
always the same. After several cycles there's a showdown with Mola Ram on the rope bridge.

Ingrid is Ingrid Bottomlow, the intellectual-but-clumsy gnome we met in Gnome Ranger. Her beloved 
home village Little Moaning is earmarked for a yuppie-friendly transformation by Jasper Quickbuck of 
Ridley's Manor. 
 
Ingrid has three cunning plans to stop him - producing a petition with everybody's signature, finding 
a more orthodox prevention method, and finally infiltrating Ridley's Manor itself by pretending to be 
a maid, and then finding proof that he's a dodgy geezer who should be locked up. These three quests 
can be played in any order, although they logically follow on from each other. She is accompanied by 
Flopsy the dog in the first 2 parts, and her cousin Daisy in the third. 
 
Ingrid's Back uses the same game system as the original, and other contemporary Level 9 titles such 
as Knight Orc . Giving instructions to other characters (including Flopsy) and jumping around the map 
using GO TO and FOLLOW commands. A living and breathing world of people travelling, trading and 
relaxing underpins it all, and plays a part in most puzzles.

eye on it and fill it, eating food found in the castle. 
 
During the game, you, Mr. Peter Stone, will interact with different persons and collect/use different 
items. Some of your actions may be lethal for the others, but you should also keep your alive and get 
your Inheritance finally.

The Inheritance: Panic in Las Vegas is a French adventure game, an early entry in the point-and-click

?The first load is entitled "In the building", where the player must leave his apartment and go to 
the airport. The airplane leaves at 11:20, and this game section starts at 11:10. Besides this time 
limit, progress is further hindered by the other tenants that appear at each floor. They demand the 
return of borrowed goods. The player can search other apartments, steal money and threaten the other 
residents with weapons (this last option can lead to an instantaneous death). 
 
?"At the airport" is the second load, where the player must embark on the airplane to Las Vegas. 
There is terrorists and other annoyances to be dealt with. 
 
?The final load is called "In Las Vegas", where the player must find the notary, while raising some 
necessary money (a testament clause says that in order to inherit the money Peter has to raise 1 
million dollars by playing games at the casinos).

to different sections of levels. The C64 version adds an icon system allowing you to collect and use 
your gadgets.

Institute, The (3783) (c) 1983 Med Systems Software / Screenplay 
 
In this bizarre text-based mystery, you assume the role of John, a mental patient who is being held 
against his will in a hellish asylum known only as "The Institute". Raving lunatics and taunting 
doctors surround you, and you are continuously harassed by a sinister psychologist who tries to 
convince you that you have lost your mind. You are unsure of how or why you ended up here, but one 
thing is clear: you must get out. 
 
Most of the game is spent lying passed out on a closet floor, drifting in and out of drug-induced 
hallucinations that reveal key aspects of the protagonist's personality and recall traumatic events 
from his past. Between bouts of nightmarish, self-inflicted "drug therapy", the player uses the 
knowledge (and sometimes even inventory items) gained from his dreams to learn more about the 
Institute and to better facilitate his escape. 
 
In typical text adventure fashion, John must navigate the hospital and interact with his surroundings 
using a very limited two-word parser. There are some basic puzzles to solve, mostly by using objects 
found throughout your quest, but the game's focus is more on the darkly surreal storyline and 
disturbing dialogue than its actual gameplay.

International 5 A-Side (3793) (c) 1992 Zeppelin Games Limited / Zeppelin Games Limited 
 
This game aims to recreate five-a-side football as accurately as possible, from a side-on forced 
perspective. The main tournament involves 8 international teams, with 2 skill levels and variable 
match lengths. 
 
Five a side football differs from the full game in many ways. The teams consist of 4 outfield players 
and a goalkeeper – the outfield players can’t encroach into the goal area (which is a semi-circle 
rather than a rectangle). The arena is walled, making judging ricochets important, and the ball can’t 
be hit above head height.

At the end of each stage you'll get to play little bonus games. 
 
While beating enemies the player will increase in belts, starting from the white belt.

International Rugby Simulator (3802) (c) 1988 Codemasters / Codemasters 
 
Seven-a-side rugby union is brought to life in this budget game.  The action is viewed from the side, 
although kicks to the posts are played from a behind-the-posts perspective. Scrums and line-outs are 
incorporated for as realistic a game as possible given the player restriction. A tournament can be 
played with up to 8 players, with as many computer teams as required to fill the gaps. 
 
In the ST version the tactical side of the game is very complex - seventeen different formations are 
on offer. Other gameplay variables can be set - player stamina (lower values forcing you to play a 
more conservative game), how long a player takes to recover from a tackle, and the standard strengths 
of passes and kicks, pus some very complicated mathematical coefficients. The ability to rename 
teams, change kits and alter the match lengths seem banal by comparison.

handle. 
 
There are 6 trucks in each race, which take place across famed international circuits. Every couple 
of laps you must refuel, which is done by driving into the pits and collecting the flag in your car’s 
colour. The top 3 finishers in each race score points, and you must finish in the top 3 to progress 
to the next round.

Pandora's first game combines the Gauntlet style with the World War 2 setting, and specifically the 
Eagle's Nest building which is being used by a commander as his HQ. Three Allied soldiers have been 
captured, and you must infiltrate the facilities, rescue your brave comrades, destroy the building, 
and salvage as much of the stolen art treasures as possible. 
 
There are eight levels to explore, each with a specific mission objective. Some of the paintings are 
loose, others are in crates which must first be shot. Explosives must be collected, not shot. With 
limited ammunition, guards everywhere, keys at a premium, and lots of strategic hiding points, an 
all-guns-blazing approach is less successful than a planned, measured one.

different enough from old movie stars to avoid a lawsuit), piecing together clues, and following

The Pharoah's Lost Tomb contains the valuable emerald of Scarabaeus, and you have set off to find it. 
You walk around from an early first-person view with 90 degree movement and four views from each 
position, aided by a map. On the first level you must touch nine ghosts, to collect pieces of a key 
to know which of the objects you will later find are medicines, and which are potions. 
 
While on level 2, you must visit information sites - you will need this to survive on level 3. These 
are guarded by spiders, which must be trapped and lured away using doors. To move between levels you 
must guide a mechanical lift, by moving the joystick in smooth circles from inside it. This final 
level contains familiar safe bottles as well as poisonous ones - all stored on hidden shelves. It 
also contains zombies to avoid or trap. 
 
Before you can reach the emerald, you must solve a final puzzle involving hieroglyphs. Arrange a 4x4 
grid so as to get the rows and columns to match, within 40 moves.

This tennis simulation followed up Simulmundo's 3D World Boxing, while 3D World Soccer was the final 
game in the series. There is some sports management involved as the player you choose (from pre-built 
selection or from your own creation) can improve his skills (forehand, backhand, serve, volley, etc.) 
as he wins matches and prize money and moves up in the rankings. 
 
There's 4 different play options: Singles Match, Singles Tournament, Grand Slam, and ATP Tour.  You 
must be qualified to play for the last two options based on your current ranking.  Beating opponents 
ranked higher will move your own ranking higher more quickly. 
 
The playing view is directly from behind the player but as you approach the net it is scaled to 
always be appropriate for what the player would see from that vantage point. The players are viewed 
in large well-animated forms and even the backgrounds of crowd scenes are also animated.  At the 
bottom of the screen there are player's photos and ability bar graphs as well as a small overhead 
view of the player's positions on the court.

held in Italy, you may choose a team to play soccer and to win the championship. 
 
On the field in third person side-scrolling view you may control the player with the ball or player 
nearest to the ball, moving him in eight directions, trying to get the ball, and performing the kick. 
Pressing the 'kick' key down will increase the power of the kick. The number of players in the field 
is unusual and consists of 7 players for each team including goalkeeper. 
 
The game is available for 1-8 players, and it has slightly different range of computer AI's levels, 
game speeds, match durations, and countries in Amiga/C64 versions.

It's Magic (3854) (c) 1997 Stardust Productions / Protovision 
 
It's Magic is a jump 'n run game about a tomcat called, well, Tommy who is trying to get back to his 
home, the Dream Islands. The story is that Tommy actually had the wish to be first one to leave the 
Dream Islands, and decided to work for a wizard in order to achieve this. One day, the wizard is out 
for a while and Tommy teleports himself away, using the wizard's spell book and crystal ball. 
Unfortunately, the crystal ball broke when he reached the outside world, so he needs to recollect all 
pieces of the crystal ball and further gather magic potions in order to get home. 
 
The game is divided into several worlds, which again are divided into stages. Within each stage, the 
player must collect all diamonds and a magic potion. The letter only appears when a certain monster 
is killed (the monsters doe not change when starting a new game). To kill monsters, Tommy can shoot 
magic. Each level scrolls freely in both directions, and monsters reappear at the same spots if they 
were not killed. Before leaving a world, the player also has to fight a boss.

Ivan 'Ironman' Stewart's Super Off Road (3862) (c) 1990 Leland Corporation / Virgin Mastertronic Ltd. 
 
Enter the world of off-road racing as 4 vehicles will face each other, on a series of tracks which 
are based around flipped and reversed versions of a core selection. Fame, glory and bikini clad women 
await your victories and the taste of dirt awaits if you fail. Let a computer car beat you and you 
lose one of your 3 credits. 
 
Successful races bring more money, which can be used to soup up their machine. Boosts to top speed, 
grip and acceleration can be purchased, and your nitro boost must be kept topped up. If you are 
desperate for upgrades, you can buy into your spare credits 
 
Only your off-road driving abilities will be enough to pull you to first place in these races. Play 
alone or with up to 3 other players (depending on the version)  in this conversion of a classic 
arcade game.

Isnogud - The Grand Vizir (3847) (c) 1988 Infogrames Multimedia SA / Infogrames Multimedia SA 
 
This game from 1987 is based on the adventures of the French comic book character Iznogoud.   You are 
in the role of the Grand Vizier Iznogoud, whose only thought is to depose the Caliph of magical 
Baghdad and become "Caliph instead of the Caliph!"  To accomplish this aim, you must wander around 
and interact with characters around you, acquiring objects along the way that may or may not be 
useful, and figure out how all this will help you achieve your goal. 
 
During the game, you have 4 different methods of interacting with other characters: you can give 
objects to them, you can threaten them, you can flatter them, and you can throw a tantrum.  Depending 
on the character, these actions will elicit different responses--or none altogether.  You will need 
objects for various things, and objects are all acquired from other characters.  Some characters are 
helpful, others are not.  But the right combination of your actions will help you to become Caliph 
instead of the Caliph, while the wrong ones will often land you in a cell beneath the palace.  Just 
be careful not to lose your own head in the process!

Jabato (13131) (c) 1989 Aventuras AD / Aventuras AD 
 
Jabato is an adventure composed of six parts, each one with its own independent argument, but subtly 
related to the main plot. In each geographic area you will have different problems, interlaced within 
a series of "custom pictures" which gather part of Europe and North  Africa as they were in the first 
century BC. It was the time of the Roman Empire splendor, their legions extend and dominate the known 
world, but in each one of their provinces the inhabitants breathe freedom and make their own rules, 
codes and rituals. In Hispania, Jabato became a legendary figure, prototype of the implacable hero in 
the fight against the evil but with a great heart. In this history you will assume the role of this 
fabulous personage. 
 
But it won't be easy: instead of living one of his moments of greatness, you will incarnate a 
defeated Jabato, without friends, prisoner in a dirty Roman jail with the bitter feeling that his 
beloved Claudia is captive in a distant land. Your final mission will be to avoid that her could be 
sacrificed by the fanatical sect of the Egyptian sub-world. For it, on the first part, you must 
liberate yourself from the Roman yoke and search for company. Multiple adventures are awaiting you 
soon in the Galia and Hispania. The second part begins in Cesarea, in which you must enter in the 
heart of Africa and obtain the keys that could allow you to survive in the lands of the mythical 
tombs, sacred Pharaohs and great mysteries. If you survive, you will fight the final battle against 
the terrible forces of the dark wisdom.

The enemy army has captured too many of your forces. Being held in P.O.W. camps, these soldiers are 
effectively out of the war... unless some kind of rescue operation can be mounted. Heavy Forces are 
too slow and visible to be of any use, but perhaps something smaller and lighter may make it in where 
larger forces would fail. A small jeep, maybe two, crewed by about 4 people.... minimal enough not to 
represent too much of a loss and yet suitable enough to aid in rescue. But of course, if these brave 
men want to succeed AND come back alive

This is a simple action game where your aim is to crush 8 spinning heads in each level. This can be 
done by either jumping on them or pushing blocks on them. While the first level is pretty basic with 
just a few blocks to move, later levels feature platforms and water, which is fatal to the character. 
Besides water, the spinning heads themselves are the main threat as they can kill Jack by jumping on 
him.

Jack Charlton's Match Fishing (3871) (c) 1985 Alligata Software Ltd. / Alligata Software Ltd. 
 
Those of you who know Jack Charlton from his days as Republic of Ireland football manager may think 
this game is about his habit of investigating the histories of English footballers in the hope of 
finding a solitary Irish grandparent so as to qualify the player for his team. In reality however, 
he's also known for his love of fishing. 
 
Up to 8 players can join in, each of whom are awarded a 'peg' - essentially a random position along a 
lake. The types of fish you are likely to face in each area are detailed before you start - pike, 
roach and bream are among the most common. Using this information you can decide which type of rod to 
use, choose your bait, and decide how deep to fish - experts in the subject will be fine here. 
 
During the main part of the game, one of the 8 bays will flash - the player fishing form this peg 
must press the relevant number as quickly as possible, then watch a short animation depicting the 
result, which is a function of how quickly you press the key, and of whether you have the right 
equipment.

Naughty toddler Jack finds himself in Africa, with the aim of progressing through 192 screens of

The jungle is full of snakes, rhinos, birds and all manner of other creatures, all of which must be 
avoided or killed - remember that their attack paths are pre-programmed, and the trajectory of your 
coconuts is quite limited. Travelling through the levels involves, amongst other things, ladders, 
mine carts, trees, ropes and logs. 
 
As well as simply completing the game and amassing as many points as possible, you can aim to be as 
naughty as possible, which is gauged by a 'Naughty-O-Meter' next to the score, with numerous objects 
available for that purpose (one can be carried at a time, alongside one weapon).

Java Jim in Square Shaped Trouble (3898) (c) 1984 Thorn EMI Computer Software / Creative Sparks 
 
Java Jim is trapped on a luxurious, but deadly, tropical island consisting of squares. In the middle 
of this island is a erupting volcano which shoots fireballs onto squares every five seconds, and 
several warp holes are scattered around the area. There are eight regions that Jim can explore, and 
in these regions, it is Jim's task to dig holes and obtain any items that he finds. Whatever items 
that he finds will be stored in his inventory, but he can carry up to eight items at a given time. 
While Jim is busy digging into the squares, the volcano continues to land on squares, and when Jim 
has dug through the square already, the resulting fireball to restore the square to its former glory. 
Jim also has to watch out for Flesh-Eater, an insect that hops around the screen undoing Jim's 
handiwork, and the only way to destroy him is for Jim to obtain an axe and hunt him down. 
 
Jim has a limited number of digs, and if he runs out, he jumps into a warp hole scattered around the 
island, and into a pit infested by snakes. Jim needs to avoid them while getting the flashing squares 
that will increase his digs. If Jim gets poisoned by a snake too many times, he will lose a life. 
Once Jim has gained enough digs, another warp hole will appear that will transport Jim back onto the 
surface. 
 
Some items help Jim deal with any dangers that appear, but if Jim happens to find a ladder, the 
volcano will turn into a series of steps which Jim can leave the region by. But at the same time, a 
nasty thief will appear and appears to hunt Jim down. If the thief manages to reach Jim, items that 
Jim obtained will be stolen one by one. If Jim leaves the region before the thief can get to him, he 
is taken to the shop. 
 
Here, Jim can trade his items for a number of tokens, and get something else on display. Some items 
are worth more than others, and if Jim hasn't got enough tokens, he is unable to trade and needs to 
go to a different region in order to drop some items that are of small value so that he can have the 
opportunity again. The main goal is for Jim to empty out the display so that he can build a device 
that will allow him to escape the island.

Jaws (3901) (c) 1989 Intelligent Design Ltd. / Screen 7 Ltd. 
 
As Amity Island's Police Chief Brodie, it is your responsibility to stop the lethal shark Jaws from 
killing the residents and tourists. The Mayor is keeping an eye on you, and wants the job done as 
quickly and cheaply as possible. 
 
Unfortunately, the main weapon which must be used to finally kill Jaws has been broken into four 
pieces, which are located along the sea bed in different places. As you explore the 150-plus screens 
of the game, you must shoot the other fish - some can be shot using your standard weapon, while 
others (those which flash) must be shot using special limited bullets. 
 
You also have responsibility for closing beaches, which removes the risk of a shark attack, but also 
costs the area business, especially on hot days, and irritates the Mayor.

J-Bird (3866) (c) 1983 Orion Software, Inc. / Orion Software, Inc. 
 
J-Bird is a conversion of the arcade game Q*Bert. The object of the game is to change all tiles in 
  a pyramid to the target color by having J-Bird jump on the tile. Various creatures and objects can 
  get in the way of J-Bird. These include a bouncing snake, cats, falling balls, and frogs. There are 
  four rounds per level, and each level increases in difficulty by having more enemies onscreen and 
  requiring more complicated rules for a tile to reach the target color (For example, on the second 
  level you need to jump on each tile twice.) On the sides of the pyramid are platforms which J-Bird 
  can jump onto to evade the snake. If the snake is close enough to the platform when J-Bird jumps 
  on, the snake will fall off the edge.

flying and aerobatics in "free flight" mode, dogfight against Soviet MiGs, launch strikes against 
land or sea based targets, watch a demo, or load a subLOGIC scenery disk.  For either combat mode, 
you get to select which missiles and bombs your plane will have. 
 
Most of the indicators a real jet fighter would have are present:  altimeter, heading, frame loading, 
gear status, brake status, fuel level, radar, attitude, and range.  You can turn a few of these on 
and off.  Controls consist of either the joystick or numeric keypad for steering and other keys to 
handle your optional indicators, landing gear, weapons, and even the eject button!  Lastly, if you

Music notes have escaped throughout the world, and Jet-Boot Jack must collect them up. There are ten 
levels, the first five of which can be played from the main menu. Gameplay is platform-based, and 
largely involves progressing down the levels, using holes and moving platforms. Enemies hover over 
the holes, but these can be disabled by toggling the right switches. There are also timing-based 
hazards such as arrows emerging from walls and lazer beams - contact with any of these costs one of 
your five lives. You also lose a life if you run out of energy. Some levels vary the format by 
requiring you to simply collect every note on a single screen, which has regeneration points and 
one-way platforms.

The famous animated TV series by Hanna-Barbera spawned a film, and ultimately this licensed game, 
which contains 8 levels alternating between side-scrolling dodge-and-manipulate and driving gameplay. 
All four members of the Jetson family have a themed level. 
 
The driving sections take place within George's Jetcar, and you must slow down for the speed-limited 
areas and beware of black holes. 
 
At the beginning of the game you are George Jetson, labourer of the Spacely Space Sprockets company 
in 2062. Your boss Mr. Spacely wants you to work, but you want to collect money and have a fun. So 
after the boss ordinary order you can explore the company as usually, collect money bills and useful 
items, avoiding dangerous robotic mechanisms and Mr. Spacely himself. 
 
On further levels, other Jetsons family members must do the same things, but at their own locations. 
Level 2 involves taking Jane out of her booby-trapped home, level 3 sees Judy trying to get a kiss 
form pop heartthrob Jet Screamer, and finally Elroy is locked in at school and has to escape. 
 
You have to activate the items hidden behind the hatches with buttons. These allow you to progress on 
level, for example, fix an elevator with wrench. Time presses and you have to complete your mission 
quickly.

Jimmy's Soccer Manager (3947) (c) 1992 
 
This football management game is vaguely linked to Jimmy Greaves, a successful former footballer who 
in the early 90s co-hosted (with former Liverpool player Ian St. John) the vaguely satirical football 
magazine programme “Saint and Greavsie”. The player manages Kettering Town of Division 5 (the same as 
the real-life Conference) and must lead them to league and cup glory, climbing through the divisions. 
 
The player begins with a squad of 13 players, and must select 11 of these to form the team 
(formations are not considered). Players can be transfer listed, which allows CPU teams to bid on 
them, although bids for any player can be received via telephone at any time. When signing players, 
there are three available each week, although only one bid may be placed. The cost of admission to 
matches can also be set. Players will occasionally contact you to request wage rises. 
 
Matches are played through via a constantly moving timer, with the score and goalscorers displayed as 
they change. There is no training, or substitutions during the matches.

Aquatania has recently become the land of misfortunes, due to a group of plotting witches. The task 
of finding five charms and a magic bracelet to put things right falls on you. 
 
And you need a change of luck, because events in this game often emphasise the slings and arrows of 
outrageous fortune. You get hit by a car, fall a great height, sprayed with cheese sandwich and more! 
Being the guinea pig in this strange world will drive you insane - if this jinxed land doesn't do it 
first. 
 
Jinxter is an interactive fiction with graphics title that takes a realistic world of people and 
situations, and then plays with the boundaries to create a strange and puzzling world. Characters are 
all getting on with their own tasks, and getting them to help you is usually a case of making sure 
something's in it for them. 
 
Dialogue aims to add a comic touch to proceedings. Puzzles can often be solved in multiple ways, but 
the most obvious way is not always the correct one. Due to the presence of a Guardian, you can't 
actually die.

Zeppelin's second game licensed from the successful darts player has a much wider scope than the

the dart, but this is constantly moving in a random arc, reflecting realistic jitters but making 
accurate aiming difficult at first. The standard 501 darts rules are among the six games included. 
 
The other games include variants loosely based on football (hit the bulls-eye to start scoring, then 
a double adds one goal to your score) and bowls (in which a 'jack' dart is thrown by one player, and 
the aim is to get your darts as close to it as possible). There are also Ten-Dart century (score 
exactly 100 with 10 darts), Shanghai (where only darts thrown at a particular area can score) and 
Scram (where one player shoots to successively knock sectors out of play, and the opponent must score 
as much as possible from the others).

Joe Blade II (3955) (c) 1988 Players Software / Players Software 
 
As Players Software correctly predicted, London in 1995 is an unfriendly unsafe city ran by thugs. 
Innocent civilians who leave the house will almost certainly face violence. An acclaimed hero since 
his successes in the original, Joe Blade is the man to put things right - if he can kill 100 thugs 
and rescue 20 civilians within ten minutes, the thugs will retreat and the city will be saved. 
 
As Joe, you must move through the streets and kill these thugs, by kicking them in the head (they 
have body armour). As in the first game, the streets are flick-screen and have many doorways linking 
them. Rescuing civilians involves touching them before completing a sub-game within a minute. 
 
There are four subgame variants of increasing difficulty, all based around a 1-2-3-4 sequence of 
numbers. The first involves simply stopping the cursor as each one appears in order - pressing the 
wrong one sends you back to having to find a 1. In the second, the numbers are on screen in random 
order, a cursor cycling through them - press fire to swap the two numbers currently highlighted. In 
the third, you are presented with two jumbled sets and must put one of them in order, by swapping 
numbers across the two sets. In the fourth, you must form the sequence by swapping an ever-changing 
number into the right place, by pressing fire at the right moment.

Examining the environment is done by holding down the button and moving the stick downwards, while 
moving it upwards will allow the player to use an object. Objects that can be found includes scarabs, 
books and amulets and can be used at different places in the levels to trigger events that allows the 
player to move on. The player has to avoid the different inhabitants of the tomb like bats, snakes 
and mummies as well as environmental hazards such as rolling boulders and spikes shooting out of the 
floor. Part of the goal of the game is to collect golden masks. The download version has nine masks 
while the tape version has ten.

Rally Speedway (3957) (c) 1985 Adventure International / Commodore 
 
This racing game is viewed from above, with the circuits comprising junctions, multiple paths and a 
variety of corner types. There are also hazards off the road to accelerate and steer your vehicle 
away from. 
 
Icy and wet roads are available, which affect the car's handling. There are 5 available maximum 
speeds, 3 levels of acceleration, and an 'Only on a computer mode' in which the hazards are merely 
decoration to drive through. A track editor is also on offer.

John Elway's Quarterback (3960) (c) 1988 Leland Corporation / Virgin Mastertronic Ltd. 
 
In John Elway's Quarterback, it's one player vs. the computer or two human players going head-to-head 
in single-game American football action.  Select your team's home city (there is no NFL or NFLPA 
license, so there are no real teams or players) and then battle the opposing team for four 15-minute 
(accelerated real-time) quarters.  Graphics are simple: one team has blue uniforms, the other team 
red ones.  The human player gets control of the quarterback on offense and the middle linebacker on 
defense.  The play perspective is top-down and vertical-scrolling.  Choose from 9 offensive--mostly 
passing--plays and 6 defensive plays.  Teams have 9 players each.

John Lowe's Ultimate Darts (3961) (c) Nov, 1989 
 
John Lowe won the World Darts Championship twice, and puts his name to this combination of 
darts-based games. There are 10 difficulty levels to take on. Only part of the board is on screen at 
a time, with the screen scrolling as you move the arrow from your perspective. This makes some 
targets much harder to hit than others. 
 
A practice mode is included, alongside standard 501 and round-the-board games, plus variants loosely 
based around soccer and cricket. In the former, the player who scores higher with each set of 3 darts 
gains territory (so in reality it’s more like US Football). The cricket variant sees players 
alternate in batting and bowling roles – in the former points are converted to runs

Jr. Pac-Man (3975) (c) 1988 Namco Limited / Namco Limited 
 
Jr. Pac-Man features gameplay similar to the original Pac-Man, but with a few changes. As Jr., 
    you need to eat all of the dots in a maze without running into the four ghosts that are trying to 
    get you. The maze is now much larger, and no longer fits on a single screen. The maze will scroll 
    around to follow the action. From time to time a tasty bonus will bounce around the screen which 
    can be eaten for extra points. There are tricycles, kites, drums, balloons, trains, root beers, 
    and other bonuses that appear as the levels progress. When the bonus items bounce around the 
    screen, any dots they touch will become larger and are now worth 50 points each instead of 10. 
    However, one of these larger dots will cause Jr. Pac-Man to slow down greatly when he eats them 
    making it more difficult to remain one step ahead of the ghosts which constantly pursue him! 
    Located throughout the maze are power pellets

Judge Dredd (3978) (c) 1986 Beam Software Pty., Ltd. / Melbourne House 
 
You are Judge Dredd. 
Your job is to track down unsolved crimes in Mega City and solve them. To do this you have your 
Lawmaster bike and your Lawgiver gun. 
 
In Mega City solving crimes means shooting anyone who looks like a threat, a perp, a seed, and that's 
just about everyone. 
 
It's a nice idea though. You start on a screen that represents Mega City. Around the city crimes are 
being committed, these are represented by white tiles saying 'arson' murder' etc. Your task is to 
navigate to each crime and hit the fire button. This takes you into that location where you blow 
everyone away in a platform like shoot 'em up. 
 
Then it's exit the location, go to the next, and repeat. 
 
While you're doing this there's a decent synth-rock sound track playing but no sound effects, just an 
on-screen comic book 'BLAM' when you fire your gun.

bombs. To make the game more challenging, a bullet will fire on the screen from time to time which 
will cause Jumpman to lose a life if hit. Each level has a different theme to it, and a few also have 
additional dangers as well. You will encounter deadly fires, the bouncing hellstones, moving ladders,

Jungle Hunt (4005) (c) 1983 Taito Corporation / Atarisoft 
 
Jungle Hunt offers four unique adventure experiences, which repeat with greater difficulty once all 
four have been survived.  If you don't survive these adventures, you will not only lose your own life 
but that of the lovely Penelope, who has been captured by cannibals! 
 
The first part challenges your Tarzan skills - can you swing on the vines without plummeting to your 
doom?  The second part pits you against a whole bunch of nasty crocodiles in a mighty river.  
Fortunately, you have a knife to fight back with.  Don't forget to go up for air!  In the third part, 
you face a battle against oncoming boulders of varying sizes and physics.  Once you've cleared all 
these treacherous hazards, you still must confront the dreaded cannibal, who is armed with a wicked 
spear.  Can you get past him and save the lovely Penelope? 
 
Gameplay involves much strategic jumping and knife play (in the river/crocodile phase).  The view is 
always a side view, much like Pitfall! and later platform games.

Jungle Quest (4008) (c) 1984 Parachute Press / Scholastic, Inc. 
 
You are code-named Orion, an adolescent agent of ACT (the Adventure Connection Team), summoned 
straight out of the hallways of your high school by Max Huntington to participate in a mission taking 
you to the darkest jungles of Africa, to locate and defuse the limitless energies stored in an alien 
artifact there before sinister competing agents of BRUTE (the Bureau of Random Unlawful Terror and 
Evil) beat you to it! 
 
Other members of your team include an archaeologist ("Digger"), an environmental scientist ("Erda"), 
a nuclear engineer ("Celeste") and Olano, your guide.  You, of course, are the computer expert, and 
your skills will be put to the test, typing in included BASIC programs to decrypt secret messages, 
weigh tolerances, plot courses through labyrinths and calculate necessary angles of deflection.  The 
abilities of the whole team will be called for to overcome natural obstacles, untrusting natives, the 
sapping effects of the Devorim Force, BRUTE agents, a traitor in your midst, the perils and traps of 
the golden lost city containing the artifact, and the deadly artifact itself! 
 
Though the story shares the dynamic 2nd-person perspective ("You try to talk, but you cannot make a 
sound") of Choose-Your-Own-Adventures, the text (like most books) is a non-interactive fixed-rail 
trip of zero interactivity -- however, some of the type-in programs included offer numerous outcomes, 
moving into the "game" field what might otherwise be best categorized as an elaborate set-up for 
low-impact programming exercises. 
 
An appendix is included describing how to modify the BASIC program listings for greatest 
compatibility with 10 of the most popular home microcomputer BASICs, as well as describing what each 
program does and how it works.  Hey!  You got your education in my adventure!

third level you are now shooting at bad guys, who emerge from locations (bank, saloon, store) on an

Kat Trap - Planet of the Cat-Men (4057) (c) 1987 Design Design / Bug-Byte Software Ltd. 
 
In the 24th century, Earth is pounded by solar explosions and abandoned by humans, and the planet is 
recolonized by a dangerous race known as Kat Men. When the solar explosions died, the humans decide 
to return to Earth.  When the Kat Men refuse to leave, a war droid known as MT-ED, or Multi Terrain 
Exploration Droid, is sent down to deal with the Kat Men. Accompanying him is Hercules 1, a 
maintenance and combat droid. When the two droids are beamed down, things take a turn for the worse. 
Hercules is kidnapped and  taken far away to the Kat Men's Nerve Center. It is MT-ED's task to get 
rid of the Kat Men and rescue Hercules. 
 
To do this, MT-ED has to explore fourteen environments and deal with deadly creatures that are within 
each environment, with each type of creature requiring a certain type of weapon to be defeated. These 
weapons - including lasers, water bombs, grenades, and rockets - can be picked up along the way, and 
MT-ED can switch between them with ease. If MT-ED comes into contact with any of the creatures, he is 
kicked into the air and gets stunned for a few seconds. If this happens, he loses one of his lives. 
Not all creatures are deadly

Kenny Dalglish Soccer Manager (4073) (c) 1989 Cognito / Impressions 
 
By 1989 Kenny Dalglish scarcely played for Liverpool, and was almost entirely concentrating on his 
role as manager, so a football management game with no arcade action featuring his license made 
sense. The game is purely icon- and menu-driven, perhaps the first step in dragging the genre into 
the 90s. Whichever team you took charge of start from the 4th division. Match highlights can be 
selected - these are viewed from the side and show goals and near-misses, although they can be turned 
off. 
 
You start with squads of over 20 players from which to choose your team of 11, each given a 
straightforward ability rating. Formations can be selected by placing each player in a precise 
position alongside the formation of the opposition team, using a fairly advanced system for the time. 
Via a separate menu you can consult with the chairman (to see if he's happy with your efforts), the 
physio (to check for injuries), the scout (who comes up with players you might like to purchase) and 
so on.

Kenny Dalglish Soccer (4072) (c) 1990 Impressions Games / Impressions Games 
 
Kenny Dalglish was a hugely successful player for Celtic, Liverpool and Scotland, before becoming the 
first person to win the English league championship while both playing and managing (for Liverpool in 
1985, also winning the FA Cup that year). This was his second licensed game, and is a side-scrolling 
action game featuring single matches played between a team in red and a team in blue, each of which 
can be any of 9 skill levels. Matches can be varied between 10 and 90 minutes. The ball is loosely 
controlled in a manner similar to the Kick off series, although it isn’t possible to pass the ball a 
short distance, so an element of hitting and hoping comes into play, especially as the ball can’t be 
curved far. The ball bounces quite heavily, and is very difficult to shoot on target from closer than 
30 yards or so.

Kick Off is a two-player table football simulator. Each player controls a team of 11 figures which 
are ordered on four bars for each one (1 goalkeeper, 2 defenders, 5 midfielders, 3 forwards). You can 
control only one bar at a time. The ball is kicked by rotating the figures on the current bar left or 
right. Game length isn't time-limited but depends on the total number of goals scored. After four 
goals have been scored players will switch side and the game will last until another four goals have 
been scored.

The original Kick Off was expanded on in many ways for this sequel. The game now features full 
tournament modes (although the players on the teams are fictitious) and four different pitches 
(including an implementation of plastic pitches, whose uneven bounce cause controversy when several 
British clubs tried them in the 1980s). 
 
Viewed top-down, the controls involve trapping the ball under your foot, giving you time to prepare 
passes. Running with the ball is tricky at first, as it doesn't stick to your foot the way it did in 
contemporary football games. Complex moves such as overhead kicks, back-heels and long-range 
through-ball passes can be completed with practice.

This is a collection of three mini-games designed to drill in some basic reading and typing skills to 
the young microcomputer user of the early '80s.  The first of the three games (each with four skill 
levels, demanding faster reflexes) presents the player with falling letters which must be typed 
correctly before hitting the bottom of the screen... and eventually the game's mascot floats down 
defying the player to type in an entire word.  The second game takes word-typing as a given skill, as 
the player is now in charge of typing in the full names of icons of common household objects 
gradually floating down the screen.  In the third game, an object is named on the bottom of the 
screen and the player must punch in the correct number corresponding to the object's icon, displayed 
on screen. 
 
The second and third games have bonus rounds whose gameplay is as the regular rounds, except that the 
icons are now partially obscured, demanding a certain exercise of player memory faculties.

Killed Until Dead (4109) (c) 1986 Artech / Accolade, Inc. 
 
Killed Until Dead is a sophisticated mystery game with a leaning towards humor. The player has to 
solve every aspect of a murder case before it happens. The five biggest mystery writers in the world 
have gathered together at a hotel and one of them will be offing another unless Hercule Holmes can 
crack the case. 
 
Gameplay is a cross between the board-game Clue and the paper-based logic puzzles in which the player 
must eliminate clues in sequence. To solve the forthcoming murder, you will have to search the 
suspects' rooms and confront them with the evidence and set the hotel's security cameras to record 
secret meetings. 
 
By questioning the suspects as to what they know about certain people, rooms and objects, they may 
reveal combinations they know will not be involved in the murder - perhaps if it involves the gun, 
the killer will not be Lord Peter Flimsey, for example.  However, there's a catch. If he accuses the 
wrong suspect, he might be the one who's Killed Until Dead - they don't take kindly to false 
accusation.

As a knight, paladin, barbarian or sorceress, amass an army of creatures to take on the local baddies 
and search for the Sceptre of Order.  A turn based game with a time limit that decreases depending on 
the skill level you play at. 
 
Depending on your allegiance, you will initially start with a different set of creatures, though the 
king will not mind whether you're his knight or barbarian. Game consists of four maps, each with more 
mean creatures to control and meaner opponents to fight, but acquiring those maps early will let you 
find and buy some mean creatures that will help you easily conquer prior maps. 
 
You can see all the enemies on the map and can literally clear the map of enemies, though random can 
appear in your castles if you leave them unprotected after the conquest. With each conquered castle 
(assuming the castle is occupied by the enemy you are currently after), you will get a level up, 
after first two level-ups king will promote you and you'll be able to recruit cavalries from the 
castle, after four more promotions you'll be able to recruit knights. All the other creatures are 
found outside the king's castle and can be recruited no matter the level, although your level 
determines the quantity of creatures you can find for recruitment, but take care of your money 
because if you don't have enough for your army's salary, they will desert or turn against you. 
 
There are also two artifacts per each map that will also uncover the map of the place holding the 
King's Sceptre. The moment you find the sceptre and bring it back to the king, the game will end even 
if you happen to find it very early in the game. 
 
As for tougher enemies, like the final one having hundreds of dragons and demons, they can also be 
defeated, but not by the army you can muster in one go. But when you're defeated, you respawn back at 
the king's castle and start with almost nothing but your money, however, the enemy in the castle will 
be left without those creatures lost in the battle, unless some of the new comes to aid him as every 
week the population increases.

Knight Rider (4157) (c) 1986 Ocean Software Ltd. / Ocean Software Ltd. 
 
Knight Rider is a game based on the popular television series of the 1980's. The main characters in 
the series, and the game are KITT - a computerised car with more gadgets than a Bond car, and Michael 
Knight the driver. 
 
The plot starts when Michael's boss, Deven discovers that a terrorist group are seeking to disrupt 
key meetings between East and West and may even be trying to start a third world war. 
 
The game is based around five missions, four of which are related to the story and are listed below, 
and a random plot. 
 
1. The Democratic Convention 
2. The U.N. Conference 
3. The Trades Conference 
4. The Presidential Dinner 
 
Each mission has a defined time for completion. The game play is a combination of first person 
driving and shooting together with some top down adventure type action. 
 
With each mission the player must drive to a designated location to start. Along the way they will be 
attacked by waves of missile firing helicopters. 
The player can choose to drive, and let KITT do the shooting, or let KITT drive so the player can do 
the shooting. Points are gained for the number of helicopters downed and both the player and KITT are 
more accurate when being driven slowly, however this eats into the mission time which affects the 
chance of a successful completion. 
 
Once at the target location the player must manoeuvre Michael around a room filled with crates and 
guards to look for clues, then it's on to the next location.

Knights of the Desert (4162) (c) 1983 Tactical Design Group / Strategic Simulations, Inc. 
 
Knights of the Desert is the operational level simulation of Rommel's famous North African Campaign 
of WWII. The game begins in March 1941 and ends in February 1943 in 12 turns each representing 2 
months. Both players goals are the same. That is to sweep across the northern coast of Africa pushing 
the enemy as far back as possible capturing key towns such as Benghazi and Tobruk along the way. The 
only difference is the direction you are heading. As the German Commander your main goal is east to 
Alexandria. As the British Commander your main goal is to sweep Rommel all the way back to El Agheila 
and win the game. Knights of the Desert provides for solitaire play where the computer directs the 
British.

After rescuing the wizard Gimbal, the Magic Knight finds himself transported into the 25th century 
aboard the peaceful trade starship USS Pisces. He must find a way back to his own time. 
 
Knight Tyme is the third game of the Magic Knight series. As in Spellbound, the previous game, the 
player interacts with the environment through the "Windimation" system: pressing a button brings up a 
window with a list of commands (pick up/drop/take/give an object, examine, command a character, read 
something, cast a spell and wear/unwear object). The player can scroll through these with the 
movement keys, and execute them with the same button used before. Spaceflight is part of the gameplay 
as the ship must visit several different planets. The spaceship has to be refueled, otherwise the 
character will be stuck forever in space. There are rooms that kill the knight instantaneously. 
Usually there is a puzzle associated with these rooms that must be solved in order to access them.

By 2133, crime is so out-of-control that a more advanced solution than prison is required - offenders 
have their minds and bodies reprogrammed to turn them into constructive and subservient citizens. As 
one of the few to refuse such treatment, you escape, and must find your way to freedom, through the 
six areas of the city, and ultimately through the city walls. 
 
You have a limited amount of time to finally escape from the city, as it is set to self-destruct. 
Enemies to take on with your punches and kicks include the guards and five other Re-Formed people. 
You must find enough food and water to sustain you as you go, as well as keys to escape and bonus 
items (often hidden) such as extra energy and points bonuses.

Konfl1kt was developed for the annual Mini Game Competition and was an entry for the 1k size 
category. 
 
It is a game for two players where they face each other each on a side of the screen. Every joystick 
controls one player and either the top or bottom border of the playfield. The controlled border has 
got the same colour as the player and pushing the joystick up or down makes the player's character 
move. Pressing fire releases up to three shots. 
 
Pushing the joystick towards or away the opponent makes the border move up or down, meaning the 
opponent can be pushed into the player's fire by using border movement. The fire button can be held 
for unlimited shots, but it needs to be released to let the bullets travel far enough or they will 
not hit the opponent.

There are a number of types of special bricks, but unlike e.g. Arkanoid, they do not fall towards the 
bat. Instead, when you hit a special brick, it flips to show a letter. E.g. E (Extend bat), C (Catch 
ball), M (Missile), B (Bomb, explodes when hit by ball, clearing a number of bricks) and X (Extra 
life). 
 
The enemies/obstacles are more varied than in Arkanoid. Some make the bat freeze, some actually chew

destroy your enemies and the Control System via Menus, both make La Aventura Espacial a new concept

mysterious land in which legends say there are a lot of dangers, hidden treasures, unsolved 
mysteries, temples filled with traps... in short, the ingredients to which the good adventurer is 
used to deal with. 
 
The adventure is developed in the island of Cozumel, where you must guide an archaeologist who had an 
incident. He was sailing towards it perfectly equipped, when an unfortunate shipwreck left him 
without anything. Do not think he only lost the map or the machete, no, he lost everything, including 
the trousers and the underclothes, reason why it's quite possible that an entrance in San Marcos, 
coastal town near the place of the shipwreck, would carry serious problems with the justice. The main 
mission of the adventure is to discover all the hidden secrets of the island and then be able to 
escape from it. 
 
This game uses the habitual commands of the previous AD adventures, plus the inclusion of some PSI 
characters, it means, personages with own personality, decision capacity, different behavior 
according to the development of the adventure, that is, personages who must be treated as if they 
were real since their reactions can vary from a game to another. Some improvements like the objects 
treatment system have been incorporated (which include all their qualities)

Guerra de Las Vajillas, La (12859) (c) 1988 Dinamic Software / Dinamic Software 
 
Karapalo emperor, leader of the imperialistic forces, and his vaguely cleaned up lieutenant Darth 
Water, the cavalier with the most stinky breath of the galaxy, are the responsibles of the most 
tyrannic government the Universe has ever known. Only few planets and hundreds of men stay rebels to 
the oppression of the empire. You, Martín Luke Skywalker, are one of them. 
 
You live in the Tutuflex planet, a desertic place located thousands of years light from our Solar 
System. Centuries ago, their inhabitants lived calmly and peacefully without more preoccupations than 
annually collecting the fruits of the plantations of giant turnips, the only source of wealth of the 
planet. Tutuflex saw with certain unconcern how the forces of the Empire, long ago a reduced group of 
mercenaries of the worst kind, became one of the most powerful armies of the universe subduing an 
always rising number of planets, everything seemed so distant… 
 
Until a sad day, the forces of the empire arrived, and before the pacific inhabitants of Tutuflex had 
time to ask themselves what it was happening, they erased by laser all sign of life and peace of the 
surface of the planet. 
 
Now you are a man without land, without family, without future… in your heart there's only place for 
resentment and revenge. 
 
Having explained this, it would look (and indeed looks) as one of the most dramatic ways to start an 
adventure, if it wasn't because it's actually a parody of Star Wars ("La Guerra de las Galaxias", not 
"Vajillas", in Spanish). Besides title, you will also notice that all names of characters, places, 
etc have been modified in order to make the Spanish user more familiar -in a non-serious way- with 
them. Add to it that even the most tense situations will have a joke surrounding them, and as a 
result you have the first integral humorous adventure ever made in Spain.

Crazy Cars III (1570) (c) 1992 Titus France SA / Titus France SA 
 
Starting out with just a basic Lamborghini and 000, your aim is to rise to the top of the 4 divisions 
of racing through success on 60 racetracks across America. In each division there are 20 rival 
racers, up to 3 of which compete in each race at a time. 
 
The races also feature lots of local drivers (who can take crucial positions away from you and the 
other championship drivers), Sunday drivers going at normal speed, and police. before each race you 
will be told of the quality of the locals and the likelihood of police presence. 
 
When police are in the area, speeding beyond 110 Km/h could see you branded as an offender, at which 
point the police will try to ram you off the road, Chase H.Q.-style. You can attempt to reach the end 
of the race despite this damage (which eventually hampers your speed), or simply pull over and accept 
a fine and the loss of race points. If the police subsequently stop you, the fine is heavier. 
 
Each race costs money to enter, and your earnings can be boosted by betting on the results with the 
other championship drivers. If one of you wins, each driver gives you either the amount they bet or 
the amount you bet, whichever is lower

2029, and the evil Blubbermen have invaded earth. Only heroic Lane Mastodan can stop them, in a

Lane Mastodon vs. the Blubbermen was one of the first interactive comic books (along with Gamma Force 
and ZorkQuest.) 
The unique element of this software was you could "follow" the narrative from a single character's 
point of view, or "jump" to another character's.  Thus, you could re-read the story to learn new 
things about how the character's different paths affected each other and the outcome of the story.

Laser Squad is by the same designer as Microprose's classic X-Com: UFO Defense. It brings to the 
table an immersive gameplay environment as well as many innovative ideas that weren't available in 
any other game of the time. 
 
In Laser Squad you control a group of "marine"-like soldiers (and the occasional cyborg). Before 
taking them into battle, you must buy them weapons and armour with a predetermined amount of credits, 
taking into account the individual abilities of your squad. Unlike X-COM, the soldiers do not gain 
experience over time. 
 
There are 3 missions in turn - in The Assassins you must face down Sterner Regnix and his guards, 
Moonbase assault challenges you to destroy the OmniCorp database, and Rescue From the Mines eschews 
violence in favour of a rescue mission. These are viewed from above and progress in turns. Laser 
Squad also features a 2-player "hotseat"-type gaming option.

wrap around the screen borders, at least until another enemy has reached your wall, but it is better 
to use up one of your electro bolts that will erase everything on the screen.

Last Duel (4279) (c) 1989 Capcom Co., Ltd. / U.S. Gold Ltd. 
 
Last Duel follows the story of two planets that are in war with each other. On the planet Bacula, the 
Galden Tribe has overthrown the government and seized power over the whole world. Now they want more 
– by invading the peaceful planet of Mu and kidnapped Queen Sheets. 
 
The Mu-ans decided to take action. They asked their best scientists to come up with a weapon that 
will defeat the Galdens. After many long months, they were able to develop a vehicle of immense 
firepower, capable of leaping into the air to avoid ground hazards. In addition to that, it can 
transform into an airborne vessel whose purpose is to eliminate any kind of enemy in the sky. 
 
Players have to guide their vehicle through six difficult levels - alternating between ground vehicle 
and fighter plane – while destroying every Galden that gets in their way. While progressing, holes in 
the ground need to be avoided, as players lose one of their ships should they happen to fall through 
one. Shooting power pods scattered around the level allows the player to increase their firepower. 
However, they lose that firepower if one of their ships is destroyed.

Last Ninja 2: Back with a Vengeance is an action/adventure game where the player, controlling a 
powerful ninja, must fight his way through opponents while collecting necessary items. The game is 
split into various levels, each of them depicting a different locale and divided into several 
screens. The view is isometric and the ninja can move in four different dimensions (he can also walk 
backwards) and jump. 
 
Enemies, armed with fists and various ninja weapons, wander around the levels. The ninja must fight

The third in the Last Ninja series sees you as Armakuni, the Last Ninja.  He is drawn again into a 
battle with evil Shogun Kunitoki.  The battle will take place among the temples of Tibet, the source 
of the Last Ninja's mystical strength.  The Shogun intends to corrupt these Buddhist temples, to 
destroy the source of power for Armakuni and his emerging Ninja brotherhood.  Armakuni must stop the 
Shogun's evil scheme. 
 
The game retains the mix of martial arts combat (hand-to-hand and with various weapons), puzzles 
involving various objects you find on your way, and navigating your way around obstacles.  However, 
it also introduces Bushido, necessary to complete each level.  Bushido is earned by fighting 
honorably, by fighting enemies with the same weapon as them or in hand-to-hand combat, and not 
fleeing from a battle. 
 
The levels correspond to the elements that combine to make up a Ninja's power, Earth, Water, Wind, 
Fire and Void.

back to the base in as short time as possible. 
 
The Last V8 is an over-head driving game where you must drive through narrow roads without crashing 
into anything, and with a strict deadline for your arrival at the base. This is somewhat complicated 
by the fact that you have only a narrow stripe of screen space to see where you're driving

Access' long line of golf simulations started with Leader Board. Hold down the fire button to set the

Four 18-hole courses are provided, and a 4-round match can consist of any combination of these, with 
up to 4 players joining in. 
 
There are three skill levels - novice players just have to hit the ball at the right speed in the 
right direction with the right club. Amateurs must be precise with the snap, to set the desired level 
of hook or slice - conventional wisdom in golf is to work on eliminating it first, then adding it 
back in - while the professional level also adds wind fluctuations.

League Challenge (4318) (c) 1989 Hypa Hypa Designs / Atlantis Software Limited 
 
An old-fashioned football management game, in which you take over one of 64 clubs and try to lead 
them to glory. The choice is fairly arbitrary, as you can rename the team, you always start in the 
lowest of the four divisions, and the kits aren't real-life. 
 
You start with only 11 players, and the maximum is 15, so you'll be keen to sign new players, and you 
get this opportunity after each match, when a player is offered, with his skill and form displayed. 
You can train your players to improve these skills, and sell players you don't rate highly. 
 
Matches are played out via a succession of short animations, in which the home side wears red and the 
away side blue. At full time you are told how many injuries were incurred. The league season features 
15 matches, one against each team, with the top two teams gaining promotion.

By 2011, the only way to travel at top speed is on skyways build high above the ground. These become 
popular with boy-racers and general speed freaks pretty soon, and that's why you're aiming to hurtle 
across them in this arcade conversion. 
 
The road scrolls vertically, with some moderately sharp bends in a manner similar to Spy Hunter You 
have a jump device to clear the many jumps,  or to land onto and flatten the other maniacs who line 
the road. You must choose which path to follow at OutRun-style forks in the road. 
 
The roads contain bonus tags including bonus points, a battering ram to make contact with other cars 
more effective, and energy boosts to replenish damage. If you leave the road you must replace your 
car onto it using a directable winch which appears at the appropriate point.

You are a simple shepherd in the world of Tarmalon who one day discovers a panic-driven dying man by 
the roadside who carries a strange leather bound scroll and a golden bracelet. This begins the 
adventure in the race against time to destroy the evil scroll and those who wish to kill you to take 
its power for their own uses. 
 
This role-playing game uses the same game engine as Questron. Your journey takes you through 
overlands, dungeons, towns, castles, oceans, pirate caves and inter-galactic museums to finally face 
the real threat to the world of Tarmalon. You will have to fight using weapons and magic, gamble, and 
trade items. Your character is rated for dexterity, strength, charm, endurance and intelligence - 
skillful play will maximize these.

Legend of Blacksilver, The (c) 1988 Quest Software, Inc. / Epyx, Inc. 
 
The Legend of Blacksilver is the sequel to Legacy of the Ancients and uses a similar but refined 
interface. 
 
In a dream, Princess Aylea, appears to you and tells you that Baron Taragas has found Blacksilver, an 
immensely powerful artifact, in his mines and kidnapped her father King Durek, the king of all 
Bantross, before he could lead his army to attack Taragas. The noble wizard Seravol has sent her to 
find a hero who can rescue her father. She leaves you with the request to visit her brother, the 
prince, at the castle, and gives you a falcon feather that will prove that you were sent by her. 
 
LoB is a one-person RPG. The interface is basically the same as in      Legacy of the Ancients with 
all commands (speak, magic, fight, rob etc.), functions (inventory, armor etc.) and 
character-information (HP, food and Gold) displayed at the left side of the screen. 
 
Combat is turn-based with different options for approaching the enemy. When you encounter a monster 
or human you can either "approach" (attack), "flee", "stalk" (which might give you the first attack 
but is not a good way to greet friendly NPCs), "wait" (the counterpart to the stalk command) or speak 
with them if they are human. You don't gain any experience from combat however. Instead, higher ranks 
can be gained at King Durek's castle for completed quests. 
 
In towns you can buy items, spells and travelling equipment or earn money by gambling, putting it in 
the bank, selling items or taking on jobs and errands. 
 
Castles contain treasures, useful items or helpful characters, but all castles (except King Durek's 
castle) are hostile and very dangerous. 
 
Unlike the rest of the game, which is seen from a top-down perspective, dungeons, temples and 
archives are seen from a first person perspective. 
 
Dungeons are large, sometimes labyrinthine, underground places filled with enemies and various traps. 
 
In temples you can improve you characters attributes if you can reach a Gamemaster and beat him at 
his game. There is a total of three different games. 
 
Beneath some of the temples you can find archives that contain different exhibits. These exhibits 
work similar to those found in the intergalactic museum in LoA. If you have the right gem, the 
exhibits can give you useful information, items or even serve as a gateway to far away places.

You play Kage, a skillful ninja in search of rescuing Princess Kiri from the hands of the warlord 
Yoshi.  Armed only with a sword and 'star knives', you must fight your way through countless henchmen 
and the occasional boss to complete your task.  Levels include the forest, moat, inside and outside 
of the castle.  These levels repeat as the seasons change.  The gameplay is side scrolling.  Kage's 
moves include the ability jump extremely high in the air, grab and climb trees, block and attack with 
his sword, and throw shuriken.  The game can be challenging at times though because the player dies 
in one hit.  2-players are supported, but must take turns.

You control a bat, which must 'serve' the ball into play, and then follow it through the level, 
deflecting it before it falls behind you, as this costs you one of your 4 lives. Initially the 
obstacles are all static, but moving barriers add timing, reactions and luck to proceedings. 
 
There are also several bonus objects, which are collected by passing through them. These include an L 
for an extra ball and dual rectangles to give you a second bat which moves around at random. 
 
The game also comes with a full level editor, allowing you to design new levels and save them to tape

the journalist Henry Morton Stanley in Africa in the XIX century. There the resemblance to reality 
ends, and turns into a platform game.

Locomotion (4418) (c) 1992 Prestige Softwareentwicklung GmbH / Kingsoft GmbH 
 
Locomotion is an arcade-puzzle game in which you are presented with a top-down view of a railway 
network with a number of stations and junctions. Trains are released from stations at random 
intervals, each with a destination station. Your job is to get a set number of them to this 
destination within a time limit. 
 
You control a cursor which can click on each of the junctions, toggling their positions. When trains 
reach a junction which is not set in a direction they can move through, they will stop until you move 
it. When they reach the wrong station they simply reverse and continue. If two trains make contact, 
they are lost, and a penalty is accrued.

Lode Runner (4420) (c) 1983 Brøderbund Software, Inc. / Brøderbund Software, Inc. 
 
The Bungeling Empire has stolen a huge cache of gold from its rightful owners, and your mission is to 
infiltrate its treasury and recapture it. This entails progressing through 150 screens of platforms, 
ladders and ropes. 
 
The Empire has sent robotic guards down to protect the gold, and contact with any of these will cost 
you a life. Your method of escaping them is to press fire to dig a hole in their line of movement, 
thus causing them to fall in briefly, allowing you to move across the gap safely. Once all the gold 
has been collected, a ladder allowing you to move onto the next screen is added. Completing these 
screens often requires forward planning and precision. 
 
This was one of the earliest games to include a level editor, allowing the creation of new level 
designs with no programming skill.

London Blitz (4437) (c) 1984 
 
During WWII German bombers turned daily existence in London into a nightmare. Most bombs exploded on 
impact but some would sit for hours, days or weeks before detonating. It was up to the Royal 
Engineers to find and defuse these unexploded bombs (UXB's) before they exploded. As a Lance Corporal 
in the Royal Engineers, it is your job to defuse these bombs. 
 
First, you will check your London map to see where the bombs are. Then it is defusing time. 
 
On the C64, you must use the joystick to cause the dial to rotate, changing the numbers next to a 
switch then clicking on the disarm switch at the bottom. If the number is wrong, you must change it 
again and keep trying. 
 
On the Atari 2600, you slide a sliding bar. On green bombs, the top bar controls the left switch, the 
middle the middle and the bottom the right.You set the slide to a spot the move to the switches and 
push right. On orange bombs, what slide bar controls what switch varies from bomb to bomb and on blue 
bombs, you can't control the switches. They just randomly change and you push right and hope you 
disarm in time. 
 
The possible ranks are: 
Lance Corporal 
Corporal 
Sargent 
Staff Sargent 
Warrant Officer 
Second Lieutenant 
First Lieutenant 
Captain 
 
At the start of the game, you can select which rank to start at, from Lance Corporal to Second 
Lieutenant on the C64 or from Lance Corporal to First Lieutenant on the Atari 2600. 
 
Every time you disarm a bomb, you move up levels within your rank. Move up eight levels and you are 
promoted. If a bomb explodes in the city and causes damage, you are demoted a level in rank. 
 
You lose the game is you are demoted below Lance Corporal or a bomb explodes while you are near it, a 
not-very-healthy thing to happen. 
 
You win if you get promoted to Captain, whereupon you will be given a desk job.

Lone Wolf - The Mirror of Death (4438) (c) 1991 Audiogenic Software Ltd. / Audiogenic Software Ltd. 
 
In this out-of-canon adventure of gamebook hero Kai Master Lone Wolf, the player controls the dashing 
adventurer scaling the interior of warlock Gorazh's sinister magic tower Kazan-Gor -- an inverted 
pyramid, broadening as it gets higher -- in pursuit of a Lorestone of Nyxator located at the very 
top.  Imprisoned in his flick-screen tower, Gorazh has filled it with monsters and traps, the most 
insidious of which was a magic mirror, Dhazag-Oud, whose seven shards reflect back superior 
counterparts of whoever gazes upon them (and which subsequently result in boss battles.) 
 
The gameplay largely skips over the choose-your-own-adventure sequences of Lone Wolf's gamebook roots 
and instead just initially prompts the player to select four of eight Kai skills (eg. Mindshield, 
Sixth Sense, Healing) to use (with restrictions) over the course of his tower travails.  From there, 
the player controls Lone Wolf's movements, skill use and attack strategies using the keyboard 
controls.

Loopz (4445) (c) 1991 Audiogenic Software Ltd. / Audiogenic Software Ltd. 
 
A puzzle game where the main goal is to make loops! Random pieces are presented over a board, 
including simple lines and corners as well as S bends and other warped shapes, of varying sizes. It 
is up to the player to link them up in a loop form, then moving on to the next level. Pieces can be 
placed on any empty space on the grid, and rotated into one of the four main compass directions. 
 
Any pieces which are not part of the finished loop when a level is completed are left on the screen, 
so there is value in playing towards 2 distinct loops, to ensure that you have options depending on 
which pieces are drawn - unlike Pipe Dream there are no clues as to which pieces are coming next. 
 
Three play modes are available, two of which can be played with two players. Game A is freestyle - 
simply make loops, gaining extra points for size and style. 
 
Game B is about unlocking bonus boards of the game by reaching a certain score. and uses a bonus 
multiplier method depending on loop difficulty. 
 
The third mode of play begins with an already made loop and then removes random pieces of it, so the 
player has to put them back in when they appear again. It is essentially a memory test and logic 
puzzle of fitting the pieces back as one remembers - although placing a piece where it seems to fit 
is also often effective.

Lords of Chaos (4451) (c) 1990 Mythos Games Ltd. / Blade Software Ltd. 
 
Turn-based strategy game based on Julian Gollop's earlier games, Chaos and Laser Squad. The setting 
is pure fantasy - the Old World is wrecked by magical discharges, and the wizards who attempted to 
keep it balanced ultimately gave up, and used their skill to create a new world. These Lords of Chaos 
(up to four, played either by human or computer) may now battle for control of this world. 
 
The idea of the game is to escape the level within a certain number of moves (preferably carrying lot 
of treasure and having killed the evil wizard Torquemada). Along the way you can use wizardry weapons 
and spells (there are 45 in total, created by combining ingredients) to conjure up mystical creatures 
like dragons and unicorns, but unfortunately so can Torquemada. Worlds include marshlands, castles 
and forests.

and volumes of water, chosen from one of the 19 predefined ones, or created using the inbuilt editor. 
 
Your army possesses infantry, cavalry and a water fleet. Natural or produced resources such as gold 
and iron are identified - countries containing these might be the best ones to invade.You can play at 
4 skill levels, and decide how big a factor luck is. With calculations settled by the computer, 
players can concentrate on the power games.

Lords of Midnight (4454) (c) 1985 
 
The Lords of Midnight brings to life this epic land, as Doomdark's forces aim to wrest control of its 
4000 screens. Your initial party of the task contains four fighters - Luxor the Moonprince, Morkin 
(his son), Corleth the Fey and Rothron the Wise, each of whom has their own characteristics. Many 
more lords can be recruited as the game progresses, with names such as Lord Dreams, Lord Blood and 
the Utarg of Utarg. If Luxor is killed, only Morkin remains under human control. 
 
The game can be won in two ways - by overthrowing the full might of Doomdark's forces, or by stealing 
the moon ring back from its location (a task only Morkin can attempt), meaning that the game can be 
played as a straight strategy title or an RPG of sorts. 
 
The land of Midnight includes lakes, keeps, plains and forests (the Fey are usually located here). 
You can always look in each of the 8 compass directions, meaning that the game features 32000 views - 
a remarkable tally in systems of this size. 
 
Doomdark's forces, the Foul, move at night, giving the game a turn-based structure. Your characters 
can also die at the hands of dragons, skulkrin and wolves.

The follow-up to the original Lords of Midnight game uses a similar game system to its predecessor, 
but the story is now much more complex. Luxor the Moonprince's son Morkin has been kidnapped by 
Shareth, daughter of Doomdark, the evil ruler deposed in the first game. The player initially takes 
control of Luxor, Rothron the Wise, and Morkin's lover Tarithel the Fey, although many more 
characters can be recruited as the game progresses, as they aim to banish Shareth and rescue Morkin. 
Shareth has brainwashed him, so he must also be turned back to Luxor's side.

and an Ice Queen in the Ice Age, a guard and a frog in the middle ages, a Cyberman in the future, and 
more mundane tasks in the present day. To enter different time zones, go into the grandfather clock 
in your home (the starting location) and activate one of the nine cogs. 
 
Lords of Time is played by typing commands to guide your character, moving in compass directions and 
with standard commands such as OPEN DOOR, GET GLASS and EXAMINE CAR. Objects you will encounter

Los Angeles (4457) (c) 1986 Sculptured Software, Inc. / Mastertronic Ltd. 
 
The streets of Los Angeles are not safe. Lately, the kids are sick and tired of parents ordering them 
about and telling them what to do, so they decide to go out on the streets and threaten to club every 
policeman who gets in their way, making the streets not safe for the public, not even for little old 
ladies who decide to take a walk on a sunny day. 
 
The bad news is: you're a police officer patrolling the streets, and you have two other police 
officers at your side. Your job is to shoot the little troublemakers that approach you. These 
troublemakers are harmless at a distance, but they are known to throw fire bombs at a few policemen. 
When you are killed by one of the troublemakers, one of the policemen replaces you as the one who 
gets to control the streets. If there is no policemen left, the game is over. 
 
There are also turret guns located on top of buildings that fire, so you just can't stay on the 
footpath and hope not to get clobbered by the troublemakers. You just have to cross the road which is 
dangerous for a policeman in situations like this. When you come to the intersection, you'll come 
face-to-face with a gang, and you must shoot each gang member before they have a chance to leave you 
for dead. Once you've shoot all remaining gang members, a man appears holding a woman hostage. The 
object here is to shoot the man to free her. If you shoot the woman instead, you'll sacrifice 1000 
points. 
 
Your score increases when you walk, but score more points if you manage to shoot a troublemaker. 
You'll lose 100 points for killing a lady walking down the footpath.

Pajaros de Bangkok, Los (12860) (c) 1988 Dinamic Software / Dinamic Software 
 
The story begins when the detective Pepe Carvalho (or in this case, you), receives a mysterious phone 
call from Bangkok by an old friend, Teresa Marsé, who is requesting you to come there to her help as 
she claims some people want to kill her. 
 
With this information, you meet all her family in the travel agency which took her to Bangkok, where 
his guide informs everyone about what happened: "In Bangkok, Teresa met a young native -Archit- for 
which she falls in love, but he turns out to be a a diamond smuggler. Teresa has the "great" idea to 
convince him to steal diamonds of his boss, Jungle Kid, but the latter's son discovers it, Archit and 
had no other choice but to kill him. Now the whole Thai Mafia pursues them, and it will be difficult 
for them to escape." 
 
With all this, nobody seems to want to go to in the search for Teresa or hire someone to travel. You 
get to convince his father that something must be done, and you get chosen as a volunteer after 
discussing the trip price with the owner of the agency. But he refuses to give you more than 200,000 
búths for the travel... 
 
After a long journey by plane you finally arrive in Bangkok, and you do not know where to start 
looking. You just know that you have to go to the Spanish embassy in Bangkok, where the ambassador 
will explain in greater depth your mission. 
 
Los Pájaros de Bangkok is a conversational adventure based on the novel of the same title, written by

the screen: score, moves, hunger, thirst and number of treasures found (out of 12).  Replay value is

The first in a series of 3 racing games endorsed by the legendary car company, which is now a part of 
Proton. 
 
The game features a total of 32 fictitious racetracks from around the world, split into 3 difficulty 
levels. There are 19 computer opponents (15 on the 8-bit versions) and you have to finish in the top 
10 (top 8 on the 8-bits) to progress. The higher you finish in one race, the lower down the grid you 
start for the next race. The opposition drivers have pun names based on the F1 drivers of the day - 
examples include Ricardo Pastry and Crashhard Banger. 
 
You can choose between sound effects or one of a variety of music pieces. The game features a 
simultaneous 2-player mode, but the 1-player mode only uses half the screen, a simple animation 
filling the other half. In most races you will have to make a pitstop for fuel in order to reach the 
finish. The tracks include features such as oil slicks, roadworks, boulders and rivers - contact with 
these (or the other cars) will slow you, but there is no car damage model.

Lucky Luke (4476) (c) 1987 Coktel Vision / Cedic Vifi 
 
This multi-genre game is based on the famous comics series about Lucky Luke, a good cowboy who draws 
his gun and shoots quicker than his shadow. 
 
It was decided to construct a railway line to connect the East and West of the United States. Two 
companies argued about the establishment of this line. You were chosen to protect the quality of the 
line and to do not give it away to the competitor. 
 
In the beginning, Lucky Luke should move around the town and find out the bandits preventing him from 
travel on the train. During arcade shooting he should shoot all of them on the streets and inside the 
saloon. 
 
After train stops in front of the boulder on the rails, Lucky Luke has to find the way to this 
boulder to blow it up with a bomb collecting the useful items and using them in adventure mode. 
During these actions he'll encounter four Daltons and Apache's leader. 
 
The next trial is a puzzle, where Lucky Luke has to connect the branch lines for the train switching 
the points on the railway. 
 
And the last one is to solve the problem of water between Comanches and the Ranch owners in the place 
where quality will be checked finally.

In this game, you must guide your spaceship around while picking up hostages located on the surface, 
and bring them to safety. Your task becomes difficult by lunar leepers who leap up and try to grab 
you or the hostages that are picked up by your ship. 
 
If you approach a hostage while a leeper is nearby, the leeper will keep walking toward them until 
they are killed. If you are grabbed by a leeper, you lose a life. You can shoot at the leepers, but 
the catch is that you cannot shoot at them while they are on the surface, and you have limited ammo. 
You also have limited fuel, and if you are half-empty, you must refill at the gas depot in order to 
continue. 
 
In between levels, you enter a cavern where you must find a huge floating object. You must then shoot 
out its core to proceed to the next difficult level.

An evil robot called Nektron has enslaved three planets and it's the player's job to take on the role 
of a Maneuverable Armed Computer Human and free the planets. 
 
The action takes places in multi-directionally scrolling stages seen from a top-down perspective. The 
goal of each of the three stages is to destroy a set number of certain types of enemies. Beginning 
with the weak Vacilators, followed by the more resilient and heavily armed Gyphons and finally,  
large mother-ships. There are many other types of enemies as well. They will sometimes drop power-ups 
that replenish energy or give access to more powerful weapons. The game gets increasingly difficult 
as the number of enemies that have to be destroyed increases and mother-ships start appearing several 
times throughout a level.

On the planet Orb live a gang of notorious Madballs who decide what is passed through parliament. 
They have no leader, and this is where a ball simply known as Dust Brain comes in. It is his quest to 
persuade the other Madballs on the planet to join him in his quest for power, and he does this by 
bumping them off the multi-directionally scrolling platforms. Once a Madball has been persuaded, it 
appears in a tube at the bottom of the screen. When a Madball ends up in the tube, Dust Brain must 
find the 'downtube' exit so that he can pursue other Madballs. 
 
While searching for other Madballs, Dust Brain encounters many obstacles that include trampolines, 
springboards, catapults, ramps, pyramids, and oil slicks

in order to get to the next stages. Navigate the maze you're trapped in and gobble up food while 
trying to avoid the ghosts that are chasing you. 
 
As a Pac-Man variant, there are some changes made to distinguish itself. Some levels offer 
transformative powers. These include being turned into a hippopotamus - which allows you to step on 
ghosts - and a vacuum cleaner - to clean up pellets corrupted by a wandering enemy. On some levels, 
you can also briefly turn the protagonist into a spaceship or a tank, where you can shoot ghosts from 
a fixed vantage point.

exit within the time limit. The catch is, that the exit needs to be activated by lighting all torches 
that are spread throughout a level. Naturally, there are lots of different obstacles and enemies 
trying to stop you. Most enemies follow a set path, but some chase your sprite through the entire 
stage. As the levels become more complex, it is necessary to work out routes that don't end in a dead 
end and allow you to reach the exit in time while still avoiding your enemies.

Mad Nurse (4502) (c) 1986 
 
In Mad Nurse you take on the role of a midwife in a maternity hospital. In this hospital the babies 
run amok, leaving their cots to stick their fingers into electrical sockets, drink whatever 
medications they can get their hands on, fall down lift shafts and engage in other fatal activities. 
This makes it difficult for a trainee nurse such as yourself to bring them under control and it's 
your job to keep them alive. 
 
Every time a baby jumps out of its cot, you must chase after it and rescue it from potential harm by 
picking it up and putting it back into its cot. 
The hospital ward is on three floors linked by a lift. Babies appear randomly at the left of the 
screen on any of the floors and crawl towards the right of the screen where, if they survive that 
long, they will fall down the lift shaft. To rescue the little dears you must run to them, pick them 
up, run to the nearest cot and put them down. 
 
The player has three  lives, or trainee nurses, to play with. A nurse is fired if too many babies die 
on a ward.  Keep enough babies alive on your ward for long enough and your nurse moves onto the next 
ward. Advance through sufficient wards and you get another life (a new trainee is assigned to you). 
Points are awarded for babies picked up and put into their cots and for medicine bottles picked up. 
Also, to aid you in your task to save the babies you have a gas button that, when pressed, stops all 
the babies in their tracks while leaving your nurse free to move around. 
 
The game has three levels of difficulty. The easy or 'No Problem'' level starts on ward 8, the 
intermediate or 'Problem!' level starts at ward 16, and the hard or 'Fat Chance' level starts at ward 
24.

Madrax is a platform game where the player walks and somersaults around a maze, attempting to collect 
six idols from a dungeon in order to stop an evil wizard's plans. 
 
There are many enemies in the maze. They can be defeated by tossing balls at them or by laying bombs 
near them, but there's a limited supply of ammo. The character can also switch to a sword to kill 
foes. The enemies can also be destroyed by touching them, but this decreases the player character's 
health. It is possible to find powerups with ammo and health. 
 
The maze contains many doors, some of which transport the character to another door, but others are 
traps and hurt the player. The game features some item-collecting: you can find a lamp which allows 
you to see in dark places, keys to open locked doors and a ladder fragment to repair a broken ladder.

Mafia (4517) (c) 1986 Igelsoft / Igelsoft 
 
Mafia is set in the Chicago of the 20s and casts you as a small time criminal who has to become "boss 
of the underworld". Starting out with smaller crimes like robberies and smuggling alcohol, you gain 
points and eventually higher ranks. Gaining higher ranks means more respect from other criminals and 
potential victims, which in turn means that more lucrative crimes become available. Shopkeepers are 
more easily intimidated and therefor more easily robbed or blackmailed. You are also more likely to 
receive hints about upcoming crimes. After a certain rank has been reached, it is also possible to 
recruit up to ten gang members which gives you a much better chance in combat against the police or 
other criminals. 
 
At the beginning of the game, your character is created by randomly determining various statistics: 
Energy: the character's health, Strength: determines how fast energy is recovered, Intelligence: 
influences the odds of success of various crimes, brutality: determines what kind of weapon a 
character can use. 
 
The game is turn-based. One turn takes one month and at every turn you can take a certain amount of 
steps, depending on your method of transportation. Most of the game is spent walking around the town 
entering buildings where actions can be chosen from various multiple choice menus: 
 
Stores: 
Try to blackmail or rob the store. The lower your rank, the higher the chance that the owner calls 
the police. If you try to blackmail someone who is already "protected" by another gangster, his gang 
might attack you. 
 
Bars: 
Buy or sell alcohol, recruit gang members, get hints about upcoming crimes, get a job as a croupier, 
bouncer or assassin. 
 
Weapon Stores: 
Buy weapons, train gang members (increase intelligence or brutality) 
 
Car Dealers: 
Buy or steal a car. Trying to steal a car is risky, but may be rewarded with especially fast cars 
that cannot be bought. 
 
Banks: 
Rob a bank (this requires another gang-member), sneak into the bank and break into the safe (breaking 
into a safe starts a mini-game). 
 
"Blüten-Eddie": 
Buy false money (Blüten) or get a fake ID, which decreases the chances of getting busted during 
police checks. 
 
Underground Stations: 
Pickpocket people at the station or inside the subway car. 
 
Train-stations: 
Pickpocket people or try to rob the train. 
 
Casinos: 
Play Black Jack, Poker or Roulette. You cannot actually play these games, you simply receive the 
results, which are influenced by your intelligence. 
 
Loan Shark: 
Lend money or start your own loan shark business. 
 
Police Station: 
Turn yourself in, bust out another criminal for a reward (only in multiplayer mode) or bribe the 
chief of police to avoid prosecution. 
 
When fighting the police, other gangs or trying to assassinate somebody, the game enters combat mode. 
Combat is turn-based and seen from a top-down perspective. During each turn you can either move your 
character(s) by one field or attack. Winning a fight increases your points, however, losing a fight 
doesn't mean the game is over. Losing against other criminals simply means that you won't gain any 
money. After losing to the police you can still try to escape or bribe the police. When you do go to 
jail, you lose precious time and points. 
 
Mafia can be played by up to four players. When it is played by more than one player, a "gang war" 
option becomes available.

Hundreds of years ago when snails still dwelled the Earth, Sonny the Snail lived happily with his 
parents in a place called Snail Meadow, and he was about to marry Dawny, his snailgirl of his dreams. 
All his happiness came to an end one day when troops of evil skeletons invaded Snail Meadow, robbed 
each house, killed their cattle, and kidnapped the snailwomen. After seeing Snail Meadow living in 
big sorrow, a wizardsnail decided to help them, but in order to do so, he needed several magic items 
- which include scrolls, mushrooms, money bags, and bag of coins - so that he can create his magical 
formula used to help track down the snailmates. He sends Sonny to collect these items. 
 
While Sonny is busy collecting these items placed, he must deal with a wide variety of enemies - 
including enemy snails, green aliens, rotating skulls, balls, and bombs – by throwing slime at them. 
Furthermore, he must avoid the acid rain dripping from platforms. If Sonny comes into contact with 
any of the inhabitants or the acid rain, he loses one of his lives. When destroyed, some enemies 
leave behind certain power-ups that award Sonny with extra lives, time, or points. Occasionally, 
Sonny must destroy “huge enemies” including a cloud that throws lightning at him and two huge brains, 
and a skull named Freddy Snailcracker. Once Sonny has collected enough magical items, he proceeds to 
the next environment.

Magic Johnson's Fast Break is fast-paced two-on-two action rather than the usual five-on-five 
contest. On screen you get a full-court, horizontally-scrolling gameplay. A referee monitors the 
action and calls the fouls if the gameplay gets too rough, and a crowd cheers you on. 
 
Your team starts each game at a certain salary level. Your goal is to beat the opposition to earn a 
larger salary. Keep winning and you might etch your name onto the Big Earners Screen. Choose from 
five skill levels - Rookie to Professional. Each level provides quicker gameplay, tougher defense, 
and bigger bucks if you win. 
 
Each game lasts four three-minute, real-life quarters. In between quarters, you can review stats such 
as field goal percentage, three-pointers made, rebounds, and steals. If the score is tied at the 
final buzzer, you play additional quarters until someone wins. 
 
You control one player at a time. An arrow appears on-screen above the head of the player you're 
running. Just hit B to switch players. You can play against the computer or up to three friends.

mages got aware of this myth and go on the search. You are one of them. 
 
Of course you have to dig deep into the underground to find them. Your responsibility lies in the 
building. managing and defending of mines. To achieve this you hire employees with different 
professions: Craftsmen, researchers, mine workers, hauliers and warriors. These people want to see 
money for their work and they improve their abilities when they become experienced. 
 
During the game you dig new alleys, equip them with traps, research new tools and fight against enemy 
troops to conquer their alleys. Later you have mutated creatures to your disposal. 
You spend most of your time on a map with hexagonal fields. There you issue orders and set the routes 
of your employees. 
 
The in 1994 released DOS-version is played in real time instead of turn based.

Magnetic (4552) (c) 1992 X-ample Architectures / Magic Disk 
 
This strategical board game is flown between two players and it deals with tiles of two colors. In 
turns players place tile of their color on the 10x10 board, and if single tile of opposite color is 
between tiles of player's color, such tile changes it color and becomes player's tile. The goal of 
the game is to collect the number of your tiles greater than opponent's number until all board will 
be filled. 
 
The game may be played versus computer or another player, but additional modes are available for 
different platforms: 
 
1. Demo Mode in C64 version, when computer plays against computer. 
2. Expert Mode in DOS version, when board is already half-filled.

Magnetron (4553) (c) 1988 Graftgold Ltd. / Firebird Software Ltd. 
 
Magnetron was a follow-up to Quazatron. 
 
Robot KLP-2 returned to destroy a series of space stations around the planet Quartech. This was 
achieved by overloading or shutting down the four nuclear reactors in each station. KLP-2 had to 
carry nuclear fuel rods between the reactors, with each rod having a positive or negative charge and 
a weight. The more weight being carried, the slower KLP-2 moved and the harder it was to get up 
slopes. The charge affected how the robot reacted to arrow tiles on the floor - a positive charge 
would move the robot in the direction of the arrow, a negative charge in the opposite direction. 
 
Throughout the space station were computer screens to give information, in a very similar method to 
Paradroid. Enemies came in various types and had different weapons, with each showing a rank and 
droid number on the front. By standing still and holding down fire, KLP-2 entered grapple mode. Now 
he could run into an enemy and try to take control. This gave a 9x9 grid of symbols. Rearranging the 
bottom row disarmed the detonator and allowed KLP-2 to steal energy for a recharge. Rearranging all 
three rows allowed KLP-2 to take over the other robot and use its abilities and weapons. 
 
Once at the reactor, KLP-2 could add or remove a rod at a time. The aim was either to overload (by 
getting a big positive number) or shut down (by getting a big negative number). With all four 
reactors shut down, the lights dimmed and KLP-2 went to a beam pad to move on to the next station.

Mail Order Monsters (4558) (c) 1985 
 
Build your own monster and send it to fight against other monsters. You can choose between 12 
different monster types (Tyro, Hominid, Arachnid, Worm, Wasp and more). Then you may select among 11 
different enhancements for each monster type (tentacles, sting, fiery breath...) and finally equip 
your creature with a weapon (rifle, laser gun, flamethrower...). 
 
Every enhancement and every weapon costs money. To earn some money your monster has to win fights on 
different battlefields (desert, jungle, swamp and more). These fights are similar to Archon but vary 
on their winning conditions. "Destruction" (kill the enemy monster), "Flag Collection" (capture the 
flag) and "The Horde" (kill more computer controlled Hordlings than your monster rival). 
 
The 3 difficulty levels of the game represent 3 game variations. 
The beginner level lets you pick a precreated monster and sends you right out into the battlefield. 
The intermediate level gives you some money to create and enhance/equip your monster. Then you can 
send your creature off to fight and possibly win additional money. The tournament level is more of a 
career mode. You are allowed to own more than one monster and get access to the corrals, which lets 
you save your different monsters and every contest result.

King Markham lies in his deathbed. Before he passes away, he holds on to the desperate hope that he 
will be united with his only son and heir, Prince Gideon, before he passes away. However, it is 
rumored that Gideon is being held captive in the evil clutches of Domir – for only Gideon himself can 
unite the Clans of the Reaches and prevent Dolmir's intended domination. Piradon, a great magician, 
has the task of rescuing Gideon, but accomplishing this task will be most difficult as his magical 
powers are limited in the lands he is about to journey. 
 
Majik is a first-person adventure where players must perform certain tasks in order to proceed 
through the game. The four arrow icons allow movement in any direction (N, S, E, or W), and can turn 
either white or red. If the icon is white, the player can travel in that direction, otherwise the 
icon is red. Next to the arrows is another icon, and selection this will present players with several 
verbs such as VIEW, LOOK, SEARCH, and SLEEP. Any objects and people are displayed in the OBJECT and 
PEOPLE window, respectively.

Murder Party (5097) (c) 1986 TRANS Fiction Systems / Electronic Arts, Inc. 
 
This strange piece of software that, as the name states, allows you to host your very own murder 
party. 
 
Murder parties, so it seems, are a cross between a party game and a theatrical play, very popular for 
more than a hundred years now. The host gathers a great amount of fictional facts and clues, and 
hands it to the players/actors in turns. At the end, every player (and/or spectators) try to guess 
who among the players is the murderer, and how he did it and what was the motive. The winner is he 
who gets the most facts right, or, in case no one can guess right, the murderer wins. 
 
The software is the ultimate tool for the murder party host. You simply input a large amount of data 
from the guests of your future party, and it automatically mixes their data with the story and 
generates a murder, motives and a large amount of clues, all to be printed into personal booklets for 
each player. It even generates the invitations to be mailed to the guests. It also provides a good 
share of hints on how to host a better murder party, with advice ranging from mood setting, music and 
costumes to even handing out recipes for three-course dinners. Once the booklets have been printed 
out, though, the computer is no longer necessary, and it's all up to the host and guests to make the 
party happen. 
 
It features two built in scenarios, Empire and Big Kill, each with different stories, characters and 
settings. And with each time the murderer and motives being generated at random, it makes for a good 
deal of parties to take place. Up to 8 players can join the fun.

Mama Llama (4564) (c) 1985 Llamasoft Ltd. / Llamasoft Ltd. 
 
In this game, players need to protect three llamas from being killed by alien invaders. To help them, 
a "killdroid" moves around the screen, and by holding down the joystick's fire button, players can 
move it over an invader to destroy it. Any of the three llamas can be killed separately, but the game 
ends if Mama has been destroyed. 
 
Before the start of the game, players are presented with a 10x10 grid of squares, with each square 
representing one wave. Each square also bears one of five icons, and the color of each square 
indicates the number of invaders present in each wave. A flashing square is located in the 
bottom-right of the grid, and this indicates the wave that you will enter. Two pointers are also 
found outside the grid, and by using these pointers, players can rearrange the rows and columns of 
this matrix to choose different waves. 
 
As the players advance through the waves, the invaders will populate over time, whether or not they 
are playing that wave. To assist them, they have a limited supply of anti-genesis and retro-genesis 
devices, which are placed on individual squares and doing this will halt and reverse the population 
explosion. Players need to quickly do this since they have limited time to place the devices and 
select a wave. The game is over once time runs out. 
 
If there is an excessive wave population, or the player completes a wave, a "nogo" icon appears in 
that square. If the player happens to move one of these icons inside the flashing square, they are 
docked a point from their "nogo" rating. If they do this too many times, the current game ends.

Mandragore (4572) (c) 1986 Infogrames Multimedia SA / Infogrames Multimedia SA 
 
Mandragore is a role playing adventure game that was originally released in France. 
 
The kingdom was at peace under King Jorian. When he was killed in a freak accident that peace was 
shattered as Lord Yarod-Nor took control and began a reign of tyranny and evil. The player leads a 
party of four characters (with the option to either define your own characters or take a  predefined 
group) through the land to eventually challenge, confront and defeat Yarod-Nor in his own castle. 
Before that can be done the group must explore nine chateaux each of which contains a problem and 
clues that are useful later in the game, battle assorted and unusual monsters, enter villages to 
trade, and develop your characters skills. 
 
The four predefined characters are 
 
1. Syrela : a human female minstrel, 
2. Podus : a male dwarf thief, 
3. Gelth : a male elf wizard, and 
4. Torlin : a male mi-orc ranger 
 
Each character has values for the following attributes, constitution, strength, knowledge, wisdom, 
dexterity, and appearance. When creating your own characters there is a maximum of 80 points can be 
assigned to these attributes with none having more than 20 points or less than 5. 
 
Character control is unusual and consists of abbreviated commands. The whole party moves as a single 
unit so to move North, South, East or West the player just has to type N, s, E, or W. 
When the party comes on an enemy the commands take the form 
 
1. character : each character in the party is referred to by a number in the range 1 - 4 
5. command : only the first two characters need to be typed 
6. target : objects and enemies are referred to by letter 
 
So when a monster is encountered typing 3 will select Gelth, typing AT will command Gelth to ATtack, 
and typing A will instruct Gelth to attack the first target. When the party acquires weapons it is 
possible to extend the command to specify the weapon to be used.

Chris Auker has stolen the Mandroid files and fled to Cove 4 in an effort to contact criminal 
mastermind, Max. A Mandroid agent is sent down on the planet to gather information concerning Auker's 
whereabouts and find the files. The agent can navigate the planet on foot, but to help him accomplish 
his task faster, he can use a remote vehicle. It can withstand most enemy fire, but it gets destroyed 
if it makes contact with any of the industrial waste rivers bordering the landscape. Energy is also 
used up, so the agent needs to stock up using depots scattered around the landscape. 
 
While navigating the landscape, the agent encounters many types of cyborgs along the way, both on the 
streets and inside buildings. The agent may decide whether to communicate with most of these cyborgs, 
or eliminate them with his weapons. Some of the cyborgs drop weapons when shot, and the agent may 
swap his default weapon for their better weapons. Most of them contain map information essential in 
accomplishing the mission, and the only way to get this is by threatening them. 
 
Money is necessary for success, and can be obtained by gambling or accessing credit dispensers found 
in the city.

Maniac Mansion (4576) (c) Oct, 1987 Lucasfilm Games LLC / Lucasfilm Games LLC 
 
The Edison mansion has always been a creepy old house on the edge of town. There have been rumors of 
strange experiments going on and of odd creatures living amongst the Edison family. There is even a 
story that a meteorite once crashed near the home nearly 20 years ago. More immediately, a girl named 
Sandy has gone missing from the local highschool and her boyfriend Dave swears that he saw Dr. Fred 
abducting her. Dave knows that he cannot do it alone and will need help from two other students if he 
has any hope of infiltrating the mansion and rescuing Sandy. 
 
Players start by choosing 2 students to accompany Dave to the Edison mansion, and can then switch 
between these three characters at will. Most actions are carried out by selecting verbs on the screen 
and applying them to an object (such as "OPEN Door"). Each character maintains a separate personality 
and may have a different way to solve a problem from his classmates. Thus many of the puzzles can be 
overcome in different ways depending on the character being used. If any one of the kids are captured 
by the Edisons, they are thrown into the dungeon and must be rescued themselves by any character who 
still has their freedom.

MASK is game based on a popular animated TV series of the mid 1980's. In addition to the TV series, 
entitled M.A.S.K., an acronymn for Mobile Armored Strike Kommand, there was also a series of books, 
authored by Kenneth Harper and illustrated by Bruce Hogarth, and comics. A new line of toys was 
produced to accompany each TV series. 
 
The stories all centre around the M.A.S.K. organisation led by the fearless Matt Tracker. M.A.S.K. 
agents wear helmets or masks to protect their identities and to give them super powers which help in 
their fight against the criminal V.E.N.O.M. organisation. They drive super powered vehicles which can 
transform. 
V.E.N.O.M., aka the Vicious Evil Network of Mayhem, are the bad guys. They are by Miles Mayhem one 
  time friend of Matt and co-founder of MASK who betrayed Matt long ago. 
 
There are four areas to the game and in all Matt must drive his Thunderhawk vehicle around the game 
area, avoiding V.E.N.O.M.'s armoured vehicles and tanks while accomplishing tasks in a specific 
order. 
In area 1 : Boulder Hill, his first task is to recover his own mask and later an abducted agent. 
However it's not just a case of driving around until the agent is found. Matt must first and collect 
a scanner which will direct him the missing agent (who will be hidden). However the agent cannot be 
picked up until his mask has been collected and the scanner will not function until the four pieces 
of the security key have been collected and assembled. Items, including bombs, are collected by 
driving over them. Bombs are Matt's only weapon against V.E.N.O.M.'s tanks and, as bombs do, they 
will damage Matt and his vehicle if he's too close to the explosion. 
 
The remainder of the game consists of three more areas, Prehistoric, Far Future, and VENOM Base each 
of which have two abducted agents to rescue.

MASK II (4608) (c) 1987 Gremlin Graphics Software Ltd. / Gremlin Graphics Software Ltd. 
 
MASK II is a single player side scrolling shoot-em-up and is the second game in the M.A.S.K (Mobile 
Armored Strike Kommand) series that was based on a TV series / comic / toy license of the mid 1980's. 
The M.A.S.K organisation is once again battling the bad guys in the form of the criminal V.E.N.O.M. 
(Vicious Evil Network of Mayhem) organisation in their transformer like vehicles. This game consists 
of three missions: 
 
Mission one is about destroying an oil refinery that V.E.N.O.M. have set up in the middle east as 
part of their bid to control oil prices 
Mission two starts with a tribe in the jungle who worship a fabulous ruby. V.E.N.O.M. have stolen the 
ruby and are using it in a laser ray gun. It is M.A.S.K.'s job to destroy the laser and to return the 
ruby to the tribe in the jungle. 
Mission three sees V.E.N.O.M. holding the president of the P.N.A. hostage and the mission is to 
rescue him and get him to the summit talks in time to sign a peace treaty. 
 
In each mission the player starts by selecting three M.A.S.K. agents. These should be chosen with 
care as the agents drive different vehicles and completing each mission will require having the right 
agent and their vehicle at your disposal. 
Once into the game the player has five lives with which they must complete their mission by driving, 
flying and hydro-planing across the varied terrain, battling V.E.N.O.M. vehicles, overcoming 
obstacles, and picking up power-ups along the way.

The ancient game of chess is recreated here, with all the traditional rules and game concepts. The 
game is in 2D, as the programmers felt this was the most effective use of available memory. Controls 
involve moving a pointer over the square to move a piece from, pressing space, then moving to the 
destination square and pressing space again. You can set the amount of time players (human and 
computer) have to plan moves, although an over-ride option to force a move instantly also exists. You 
can save and reload games, and at any point can move pieces either from current settings or from 
scratch, to completely customise the game or play out classic positions.

Master of the Lamps casts you as an Eastern prince hoping to become King. There are two distinct 
gameplay sections, through which he must prove his worthiness. Firstly, you must ride a magic carpet, 
flying through a series of diamonds which twists and turns more as you move through the 41 levels. 
 
Alternating with this, you are in front of a row of pipes. Hit a gong 3 times to summon a genie, who 
will play a sequence of notes. Once the last one has been played, they fly towards you in order, and 
their colour equivalent on the row must be hit (the number of times they are played), before the 
flying note can hurt you. Complete this and a piece of lamp is granted.

Masters of the Universe - Super Adventure (4631) (c) 1986 Adventuresoft UK Ltd. / U.S. Gold Ltd. 
 
This interactive fiction title (one of three licensed Masters of the Universe titles released in the 
mid 1980s) might suit the more intellectual He-Man fans. Skeletor has developed an Earthquaker 
device, which uses hypnotic rays to control a horde of Rockbinders -  gigantic boulder beasts capable 
of gnawing through solid rock. As the game starts, the beasts are tunnelling beneath the Shadowlands 
and approaching Eternia. As Adam AKA He-Man, can you stop Skeletor and his evil plan before it is too 
late? 
 
The game is reasonably easy by adventure standards, and uses a largely two-word parser with commands 
such as ENLIST, EXAMINE and FIT. Time saving commands include GET ALL and DROP ALL, and BOM (back one 
move) for undoing mistakes.

In a spin-off from one the most popular cartoon franchises of the day, the evil Skeletor has captured 
the magic-giving Ilearth Stone . This allows him to take control of Castle Grayskull, kidnap the 
Sorceress, and create a horde of fighters to attack He-Man's palace. He-Man must first rescue Orko 
from an 'imprison' spell (by collecting the right ingredients to cast a counter-spell), before taking 
on the full horror of the defences Skeletor has placed around the Ilearth stone. 
 
He Man must use the Sword of Power to destroy the foes he faces throughout his journey, which is 
horizontally-scrolling. He-Man has a limited amount of time to complete his task, and a limited Body 
Shield to protect him for combat harm.

The original Match Day was the first serious football game to hit the Spectrum, and this sequel 
emerged over 2 years later. League and Cup tournaments for up to 8 teams (any or all of which can be 
human-controlled) are offered alongside one-off Friendly matches with a handicap option - passcodes 
are given to allow you to restore these to the same state another day. 
 
Matches are seven-a-side, with variable lengths from 10 to 30 minutes. All kicks except set pieces 
are variable in strength using a Kick-o-meter which is displayed on screen. One revolutionary feature 
of the game was the Diamond Deflection System, which mathematically calculated the angle and pace of 
any rebounds.

There was a massive wave of football management games in 1992, and this was Zeppelin's contender. It 
was licensed around the BBC's football highlights programme famed for its classic theme music. The 
standard options exist (such as training, transfers and tactics) but the control system is unique. A 
diary is presented on the table, and you have to drag the icons for the activities you want to focus 
that amount of time on. This not only makes the presentation and style unusual, but also accurately 
represents the limited amount of time a real manager has.

Matrix (4651) (c) 1983 Llamasoft Ltd. / Hesware 
 
Attack of the Mutant Camels is sequel to Gridrunner.  In this Centipede style game you play a retired 
captain of a starship, one of those who had won the previous war against aliens.  You come out of 
retirement because the aliens are back, tougher than ever.  Thus a second gridwar begins. 
 
You pilot your ship and shoot at chains of pods coming at you.  As you hit the pods, they break into 
smaller independent chains.  The aliens seem to have a sense of humor, though.  Each pod in the chain 
coming at you looks like a...camel.  Flying camels from outer space. 
 
As you start shooting the camels, you are attacked by guns from the bottom of the screen and from the 
left side of the screen.  Even worse, a human traitor has joined the aliens, and when he appears on 
the screen, running across the grid on top, the guns get very accurate at shooting you.  Luckily you 
can shoot traitors. 
 
Other twists include deflectors, which turn your bullets and even ricochet them back at you.  The 
enemy fires back too.  And as you advance in level, the enemy changes the direction of their attack.

Max Headroom (4659) (c) 1986 Binary Design, Ltd. / Quicksilva Ltd. 
 
This game is based on a 1984 British television movie which led to a 14-episode television series 
that ran in 1987 in the U.S.  It's an early cyberpunk vision set "twenty minutes in the future" where 
powerful corporations rule and compete for television ratings and consumer dollars.  Edison Carter is 
an investigative reporter for Network 23 seeking to free his alter ego Max Headroom, a cybernetic 
construct of his mind that was stored after Edison was involved in a motorcycle accident and the last 
thing he saw before losing consciousness was a "Max Headroom" sign going into a tunnel.  Max lives in 
computers and can appear on any screen, television or any electronic device.  The character is 
actually Matt Frewer in a latex mask, edited so as to appear jittery and stuttering like an early 
computer model. 
 
In the game, Max has been abducted by Network 23 and you must retrieve him from somewhere in the 11 
top floors of their high-rise building starting at the 200th floor.  Security systems protect each 
floor and you have to find and enter the correct codes to gain access from the elevators.  Each floor 
seen in isometric view, has lines representing walls of various rooms with doors and office 
furniture.  Robots will chase and fire at you and decrease your health level as shown on the 
biomonitor at bottom of screen.  Also indicated are the floor number and time left.  On the right 
side of screen are 4 icons for Reporter E. Carter which open a door, call elevator, view through 
camera, or allow movement to run around the floor.  On the left side are icons for Controller T. 
Jones (Theora helps you hack into systems) to show you the floor and computer circuits. 
 
When entering a security code, it takes the form of an LED digit over which you must move a pointer 
over a row of circuit lines in order to activate various segments to form a desired digit.  Each 
segment will remain lit only temporarily so when time runs out you must ensure that the letter is 
fully lit or your code will fail.  In that event, you must make your way across the floor to the 
second elevator and try again.

Mayhem in Monsterland (4673) (c) 1993 Apex Computer Productions / Apex Computer Productions 
 
Mayhem is an unhappy dinosaur, as Monsterland is an unhappy place, due to an apprentice magic 
dinosaur who decided to practice some of his master's spells, after drinking too much cactus juice.  
Mayhem decides to change it back, with the help of Theo Saurus, the apprentice responsible for 
Monsterland being the gloomy place it is now. 
 
The game is a side-scrolling platform game, where you play the part of Mayhem.  You can kill enemies 
by jumping on them. 
 
There are five levels in the game.  Each one starts in unhappy mode, where Mayhem must collect enough 
bags of magic dust, from the enemies you face, then find your way to Theo's hidden cave.  Theo then 
uses the dust to make the level happy again.  This change is reflected in the more jazzy music, 
colourful landscape and even the monsters who look more friendly and cheerful. 
 
Some of the magic, however, clumps together into magical stars, that Mayhem must collect, on the 
happy version of the level, to stop them falling into the wrong hands.  There is a quota of stars 
that Mayhem must collect, before going over the finishing line. 
 
In the happy version of the level there are more bonuses that can be collected, such as score 
multipliers, extra lives, extra time, etc.  The most important is probably the ability to charge, 
allowing Mayhem to run very fast, killing any enemies in his way.  Also, he stops with a skid, and 
extra points are awarded for a long skid over the finishing line.

Maziacs is a maze game. The maze in Maziacs has no edges but has around 100 locations and a new maze 
is generated at each game start. The aim of Maziacs is to find the treasure and take it to the point 
the game started. 
 
All scattered over the maze are prisoners, food, swords and treasures for you to collect but you are 
chased by monsters that will attack you. 
 
A sword can only kill one Maziac, a hostile and horrible monster and it's only possible to carry one 
item at the time. Without a sword, you can still fight Maziacs, but your chances of victory are much 
lower. 
 
You need to collect food or you will die of starvation. 
 
To find the treasure you should ask the prisoners who can show you the way, but only for a short 
distance. The route will turn yellow for a short time. 
 
The prisoners will also tell you the way back to your starting point. 
As you can only carry one item at the time it is best to kill as many Maziacs on your way to the 
treasure.

Mean Streak (4694) (c) 1987 Dalali Software Ltd. / Mirrorsoft Ltd. 
 
In the future, most people travel using Matter Transporters, but to Rebels this is dull. They have 
taken the abandoned orbital road and turned it into the Battletrack. You take your Mean Streak 
motorcycle and set out to dart through this dangerous Mad Max style world, with the aim of getting 
though these tough isometrically-viewed roads. You are armed, but so are the Outcasts you must face. 
 
Hazards include walls, gaps in the road and oil slicks. A scanner at the bottom of the screen gives 
some advanced warning. You can pick up improved weaponry, extra fuel, and boxes of oil, which you can 
drop into the paths of onrushing bikes. As well as shooting other bikes, you can ram them into walls 
at the side of the road, or into the aforementioned hazards.

Mean Streets (4695) (c) 1989 Access Software, Inc. / Access Software, Inc. 
 
Private investigator Tex Murphy is hired to investigate the murder of a university professor. It 
turns out that he was one of eight scientists involved in Project Overlord, a mission to remotely 
control people. You soon learn of the deaths of other related figures. Suspects may include the 
British intelligence head, a surveillance company owner, and the professor's daughter. 
 
Tex's first adventure (and the only one released for systems other than DOS or Windows PCs) takes you 
through the seedy West Coast world of 2033. The game is icon-driven, with object puzzles less 
significant than detective deduction and character interaction. 
 
Mean Streets features dozens of characters to interact with by asking questions or offering bribes. 
Fights often arise, but a diplomatic approach is more successful with characters whose guilt is 
unproven. Although it is largely an adventure game, travel between cities involves piloting your 
Lotus Speeder in a flight simulation section.

Medieval Lords is a strategic political/war simulator starting in 1028AD and continuing for up to 100 
turns / 500 years. Up to 10 players can take part, with the computer controlling up to 6. Limits can 
be set on how many actions can be performed in each turn, so be wary of over-expanding if there is 
not much time to give orders. Gameplay takes place in Europe, North Africa, and the Middle East, in a 
world full of conquests, diseases and change. 
 
You are an adviser to a King, Caliph, Sultan or other leader, and must first manage domestic issues 
such as the economy and political stability, before attempting to conquer or form alliances with 
other regions. Random events such as plagues and religious orders ensure that each game is different.

It is a very strange universe really - isn´t it? All those millions of planets and moons and stars 
and comets swirling about in the vastness of space. Imagine what fun it would be to explore - to 
boldly go where no boldly goer had boldly gone before - unless they happened to live there. 
 
Latest research from the Institute of Advanced Research (I.A.R.) indicated that there are quite a lot 
of planets with things living on them. Some of these things are pretty intelligent like us really. 
Other of these things are really stupid, like whelks, for example. 
 
Anyway, to cut a long story short, you have been selected to explore the universe, boldly seeking out 
strange and exciting new worlds. If you find any, your instructions are quite clear. 
 
BLAST THE LIVING DAYLIGHTS OUT OF THEM!!

Mega Corp (10903) (c) 1987 Dinamic Software / Dinamic Software 
 
In the XXII century the universe is dominated by two major forces born after decades of major wars: 
the Empire and the Hark Federation. Being both of them expansionist governments, frictions in their 
borders are almost constant. 
 
Within the Empire, the biggest power after the emperor himself, are the Mega Corporations, financial 
partnerships that control every aspect of people's lives. With power of life and death, these 
Mega-Corp, as they are familiarly known, extend their tentacles by the Cosmos in search of riches to 
extract or eventually snatch. 
 
The federal system consists in the "adoption" under its tutelage of technologically poor planetary 
systems in general, although rich in material or manpower that are invariably employed in improving 
the resources of the originary Hark planets. 
 
"Megacorp" is a conversational adventure with static graphics in which you will take part of the 
Imperial federation. Your exact mission would be guiding your operative agent to get control of the 
situation on the GEA-3 planet. You should, helping rebel groups, overthrow the government, now in the 
hands of The Federation. 
 
Your craft will land on the forest surrounding the rebel base. Cross the lake, pass police checks and 
find your link to be identified by their status as merchant in fur, from here follow his 
instructions. The mission is risky but the reward is great, if you make GEA-3 planet be part of the 
Empire, you will get immensely rich.

Mega Phoenix (4707) (c) 1991 Creepsoft / Dinamic Software 
 
Mega Phoenix brings the concept of the earlier arcade game Phoenix into the 90s, to the extent that a 
coin-op version was later made by Gaelco. The game is a single-screen shoot ‘em up in which the 
player moves left to right while shooting several waves. There is a shield function available, which 
lasts for a short period of time (after which it must recharge to be used again) and it paralyses the 
craft while active. 
 
The first waves consist of several small alien beings in a set pattern, which move down from the 
fleet towards the player at random intervals- contacts with these kills the player. Deadly phoenixes 
firing at you come next, followed by the Mega Phoenix itself and then a final boss, before it all 
repeats with higher difficulty.

Wee Willie is a window washer at an apartment who wants to keep his customers happy. Some of the 
customers welcome him and want their windows washed while others are worrisome about his wet work and 
would not want him washing their windows. There's only so much water for Willie to wield in his 
bucket, so he must only waste it on the welcoming window wash customers. It's also raining so Willie 
will have to remember who lives where. 
 
Memory Manor is a memory matching game played from a side-view perspective. Players take control of 
Wee Willie who can move left and right, climb ladders and choose to wash a window he is in front of. 
The game relies on memory, after a brief glimpse of the people in the manor the windows fog up, 
hiding the occupants. The player must remember which windows contain happy customers and wash their 
windows. Willie has a limited water supply and so must not waste washing on anyone who doesn't want 
their windows washed. The game is over if Willie uses up all of his water.

mysterious war hero whose name and identity are shrouded in secrecy) is threatening the nations of 
the "West" with the development of a new prototype weapon named Metal Gear, a walking tank which is 
capable of launching nuclear warheads from anywhere on the globe. As FOX-HOUND's (an elite black ops 
unit) newest recruit, going by the codename of Solid Snake, your mission is to infiltrate Outer 
Heaven and rescue your missing comrade, Grey Fox (who was captured after a failed infiltration), 
while gathering intelligence on Metal Gear. In order to fulfill your objective, you must collect 
various weapons and equipments (including keycards for further access into the fortress), while 
avoiding visual contact with the enemy. The player must also confront against bosses in the form of 
Outer Heaven's elite mercenary force and rescue hostages hidden within the fortress in order to 
increase their rank, which gives the player an extended life bar and increased storage capacity for 
replenishable items and ammo. The player can use a wireless transceiver to come in touch with their 
commanding officer, Big Boss, to learn more about their current mission objectives or contact one of 
the local resistance members operating covertly within the fortress to gain useful tips and insights.

This is done through a combination of driving and shooting, through an overhead rendition of Miami. 
When crooks are stopped they will often provide valuable information, although sometimes they can 
only be stopped by shooting them. 
 
When you learn of a meeting, you can enter it on foot, either to gain evidence or make an arrest - 
but remember that a joint full of crooks will not simply allow you to do your civic duty. This is all 
done against a time limit, with a one-minute penalty for crashing the car.

for the former and an axe for the latter, both of which need replenishing regularly. Some doors 
require keys to move through. 
 
There are several sub-games, including Pac-Man and Donkey Kong-derived games. To win the game you 
must finally beat the Ogre King.

Mickey's Runaway Zoo (4780) (c) 1991 Westwood Associates / Walt Disney Computer Software, Inc. 
 
In Mickey’s Runaway Zoo both Mickey and Goofy team up to return all of the animals back to the zoo. 
This is done by a series of screens for young children to start visually identifying numbers 
incorporated into vivid color landscapes. 
 
When the child finds a number and presses the matching number on the keyboard, they are rewarded by a 
quick set of animations. Each animation shows that numeric amount of animals entering the wagon for 
return to the zoo.

Mickey's Space Adventure (4781) (c) 1984 Sierra On-Line, Inc. / Walt Disney Computer Software, Inc. 
 
Walking along one day, Mickey and Pluto come across a spaceship. After boarding the ship, they are 
given a quest by XL30 from the planet Oron. A long time ago, a thief stole the planets memory crystal 
and broke it up into nine pieces, hiding them on each planet in the solar system. It is Mickey's job 
to travel to each planet and locate the crystals so the inhabitants of the planet Oron may receive 
their memory back. Information about the different planets and locations visited are displayed on 
arrival, and XL30 may occasionally give clues through the ships computer. The interface for the game 
doesn't use a text parser, instead short sentences are created by using the cursor keys to highlight 
the necessary words from a selection on the screen. The game will also suggest better options if an 
illogical or impossible action is requested.

it unfolds. 
 
A wide range of strategies are available. You can bring the stand-in players in, and instruct players 
as to how aggressively to play when opportunities arise, with 7 distinct batting strategies. When 
fielding you have options on field placement and bowling style - use the fastball and curveball 
wisely. Players will sometimes pick up injuries (the correct level of warming up can reduce this 
risk), or argue with the umpire over controversial decisions.

Might and Magic - Book One - Secret of the Inner Sanctum (4816) (c) 1987 New World Computing, Inc. / 
New World Computing, Inc. 
 
In Might and Magic, the player controls a party of adventurers in a medieval world called Varn. 
Before long the heroes realize that one of the four kings that rule the countries of Varn is in fact 
an impostor, a creature from outer space. Your task is to find the real king and ultimately to stop 
the alien invasion into Varn. 
 
This is the first game in the  Might and Magic series, and one of the prototypes of role-playing 
games in general. The entire game is viewed from first-person perspective. The player creates a party 
of six adventurers, with traditional classes to choose from (fighter, cleric, etc.). The player also 
specifies the gender and the age of the characters - they grow old and will eventually die of natural 
causes. As in most RPGs, the gameplay revolves around exploring the game world, performing quests, 
and leveling up to be able to proceed to the story-advancing challenges. The turn-based battles 
typically take place against six monsters, but enemy reinforcements can appear once their comrades 
have been slain.

pretty much the same game engine and presentation. Embark on a glorious journey then save the world 
of CRON and yourself. 
 
A balanced party is a necessity in this game. There are several locations and items that are 
restricted to certain genders, alignments, or races. A party made up of Good Human Males won't get 
you very far. Time plays a large role in this game. Time travel is a part of it, but on a more basic 
level, you will find that characters age as the game goes on. If you wait too long, your characters' 
statistics will change to reflect their aging.

Mikie (4823) (c) 1986 Konami Corporation / Imagine Software 
 
Mikie puts you in charge of Mikie, a high school student who likes to win hearts of every girl that 
he can lay his eyes on. 
 
There are several classrooms to explore like the Quantum Physics Room, Locker Room, Canteen, the 
Aerobics Dancing Class, and the Playground. In each classroom, Mikie has to collect all the hearts 
that are found in each classroom to form a message. In order to collect these hearts, Mikie must 
stand somewhere near them and shout out. There are two type of hearts: small  and large. Mikie needs 
to shout out only once to collect the small hearts, and multiple times to collect the large ones. 
When a message is formed, Mikie can exit the classroom through a door marked OUT. 
 
Stopping him from collecting the hearts is the teacher, the chef, and the janitor. The teacher is the 
worst one. When he is unable to  catch you, he works up a sweat, and eventually, throws his teeth at 
you. When his teeth hits Mikie, he loses one of his three lives. In later classrooms, Mikie can throw 
stuff at his enemies in order to stun them for several seconds (for instance, the basketballs in the 
locker room, and the chickens in the canteen). The janitor isn't as bad because he walks much slower 
than the others. 
 
In between levels, you have to enter the next classroom through a door marked IN without being 
caught, but you can do at least two things to pass time: Steal some lunch, and open one of the 
unmarked doors to receive a punch, a kick, or the chance to see a naked lady with breasts. Beware 
that if you take too long in the hallway and don't travel between floors, a bucket slides across the 
screen real fast and attempt to slip you. 
 
If you're good enough at the game, you can enter a high score, and if you fail to enter anything, the 
game will assume that you are Clint Eastwood.

Mindbender uses similar gameplay principles to Deflektor, which means that you have indirect control 
over a beam of light. On each of the 50 levels you must guide it from a starting point to an ending 
point, taking out all the enemies along the way. Rotating each of the many mirrors on the level to 
send the beam onto the points the enemies hover over does this – reaching many of them will involve 
several attempts at finding the right combination of angles. Rotating barriers, light bulb switches 
and locked sections must all be taken into account, but there are also magic balloons later on. All 
this must be done within a time limit, and directing the beam back into itself causes overloads and 
must be avoided, Tron-style.

Mindfighter (4844) (c) 1988 Abstract Concepts|Infinite Imaginations / Activision (UK) Limited 
 
The computer game of an Anna Popkess book (which was originally bundled with the game) uses an 
interactive fiction System Without A Name, or SWAN for short. It’s set in a post-apocalyptic world of 
guards desperately attempting to retain order over mobs of genetically-mutated thugs, with extensive 
use of the death penalty. 
 
Into this maelstrom steps Robin, an 11-year-old psychic beamed forward in time from before the drama. 
Adjusting to a completely different form of life, Robin must learn to survive and get adequate food, 
and ultimately infiltrate this vicious police state. 
 
Encounters with other characters are frequent, of whom some retain a semblance of old humanity. 
Daryl, Alison and Matthew all come in handy, and must be coaxed into doing what you wish. Examining 
objects often gives few clues, so the detail in the manual is vital, although few of the objects are 
vastly different from familiar 20th century artifacts. Two levels of object descriptions exist, 
allowing for faster or more immersive play.

You are in control of a crosshair, which can be moved to cover four blocks. Holding fire while 
pushing left or right and hovering it over a group of 4 will move the four blocks around in sequence. 
Things can get harder when the level arrangement results in blocks having to be moved through 
sections with a column of only 2, or when some parts of the arena lack cogs, meaning that you can't 
move on those sections. Later in the game you'll have to work on multiple floors at the same time, 
switching blocks between them.

You play the part of Bounty Bob, and it is your mission to explore every inch of an abandoned mine. 
As you walk over floor sections in the mine, the floor will change color. When all of the floor 
sections have been changed in color, you can move on to the next, more challenging level. To reach 
all of the floor sections, you will need to figure out how to get there! You can jump (be careful not 
to fall too far though, or you will be squished), climb up and down ladders, and use different 
transportation devices that can be found on the levels (such as an elevator, slides, a springboard, 
or a canon!) Wandering around the mine are numerous radioactive creatures which get in Bounty Bobs 
way. Also scattered throughout the mines are various artifacts left behind

Mini Putt (4871) (c) 1987 Artech Digital Entertainments, Inc. / Accolade, Inc. 
 
Mini Putt is a miniature golf game that offers 4 courses, Deluxe, Classic, Traditional and Challenge. 
Up to 4 players can either play a game or practice any hole on any course. Each course offers its own 
difficulty level. Deluxe and Challenge have difficult hills and course layouts. The Challenge being 
the more difficult course. The Classic offers animated bridges and other obstacles. The traditional 
is your standard miniature golf course which requires well placed bank shots. 
 
To make a shot, using the joystick, move the crosshair in the approximate direction and distance 
where you wish the ball to go. When you are ready to shoot, hit the fire button. You will notice the 
level rise in the power bar. When the bar reaches the desired distance, press the fire button again. 
When you release the fire button, the bar starts to move back down. The mark where you stopped the 
bar moving indicates the power with which you hit the ball. When the bar reaches the bottom of the 
power bar, it moves horizontally on the accuracy bar. In the middle of the accuracy bar is the center 
line. Too much to the left of center, it pulls to the left. Too much to the right of center, it pulls 
to the right. Press the fire button at the right moment to hit the ball. If the course proves to be 
too tough, visit the Practice course option. Not all of us can be a pro.

A bomb has been set by terrorists to blow up a sky-scraping hotel in which the FBI’s Central 
Intelligence Unit is located, and you must diffuse it. 
Reaching the room itself is no easy task, as the hotel is split into segments of 8 floors, and you 
can’t move onto the next one without the emergency key, which the porter has hold of – he must be 
located. Each of these has one eighth of the secret stop code, and these must be entered in order to 
finally diffuse the bomb. Secrets can be gleaned from the opposing hijackers, and from the barman. In 
some cases furniture can be used to your advantage. 
The whole game is similar to Impossible Mission, requiring lots of logic, puzzle-solving and

Mission Omega (4909) (c) 1986 
 
Omega is the codename for a mysterious alien craft which has appeared in space, armed with 
potentially destructive missiles. Your task is to reach it, and then disable its four reactors and 
escape within a hour - this way it can be explored, and its technology exploited, without it firing a 
missile or falling into enemy hands. 
 
You do this by guiding a robot droid through the corridors and rooms which make up the ship. You 
control the game using an icon system, and your first task is to configure the robot with the weapons 
and power supply you feel will be the most effective. Rather than individually directing each move, 
you can use the inbuilt map to plot a course for the robot.

theme. 
 
Thunderhead is a once-desolate planet now teeming with life, thanks to the hated Eternals. They have 
set up an underground complex, which is their main power base. 
 
The game is split into two parts - Operation Tempest and The Final Appeal. In Operation Tempest you 
must find and activate the device needed to destroy the planet. In The Final Appeal you must find the 
items which will allow you to appeal the charges the Eternals hit you with. 
 
Gameplay involves jumping and shooting - the player must collect the items which allow you to defeat 
monsters. There are also mazelike sections. Weapon power-ups and reloads can be found, as can extra 
lives. The game has 10 preset levels, and a seed number to allow over 1000 variations of play.

Molecule Man is trapped inside a radioactive maze of 256 screens, and it's your job to get him out. 
To do this you must collect 16 circuits which are located at extreme points of the levels. You must 
regularly consume radiation tablets to fend off certain poisoning, and your initial supply of 20 is 
totally inadequate. 
 
Fortunately, there are coins dotted around the levels, as well as ant-radiation tablet vending 
machines at which you can buy them. Coins can also be used to buy more time, or to blow up obstacles 
which make some sections difficult or impossible to access. 
 
Viewed isometrically, the screen designs are intentionally surreal, each taking on an unlikely 
distorted real-world theme. If you find the initial level layouts too easy, too hard or too dull, you 
can design a new set with the bundled maze editor.

around to the different locations, players can re-stack them under an apple so they may pick it. When 
both apples have been picked, the level is complete. The score is based on the number of moves it 
takes to complete this task. There are three skill levels, each of which have a different number of 
monkeys that must be manipulated.

Moon Dust (4978) (c) 1983 
 
Moondust is an experimental game by virtual reality pioneer Jaron Lanier. It fuses together a complex 
control mechanic with a musical score generated by the player's movement. It consists of different 
scenes that show a space walker and six space ships floating around and bouncing off the sides of the 
screen. Even though they all go in a different direction, the player controls them all at the same 
time using a joystick. However, they only curve gradually into a new direction and are hard to 
control. When everybody moves in a new direction, the space walker's head becomes loose and follows 
the desired direction, while the body only slowly attaches itself again. Ships do not always obey the 
joystick. When they come close to the edge of the screen, they become dizzy and won't follow commands 
for a short time. Pressing the fire button changes everyone's movement to clockwise or 
counter-clockwise. 
 
With a press of a button the space walker drops a seed, but only when he isn't near the middle of the 
screen. To progress, the space ships need to be steered towards the seed. Once they hit it, they will 
draw it out and spread the seed for a short time, and to progress, this needs to be done towards a 
circular sign usually in the middle of the screen as a form of rudimentary astral procreation. A 
single seed can be smeared out by multiple ships for a short time. Each smeared out seed drop inside 
the circle is awarded with a score and when a ship gets to spread it very close to the centre of the 
circle, a "bullseye" is awarded with maximum points and an extra seed. To progress to a new screen a 
sufficient amount of seed needs to be carried inside the circle. Scores are higher when the initial 
seed of the space walker is dropped further from the middle. In later levels the circle becomes 
smaller and initially the space man only has three seeds before the game is over. There is no time 
limit for dropping the seed. The space walker cannot smear the seed, except in the Spinsanity game 
mode, and to a limited degree. Sometimes the space walker is knocked out by the space ships in a 
collision. This may only happen a certain number of times and with each knock-out his colour changes. 
 
Music consists of blips and electronic sounds that blend together in harmonies influenced by the 
player's movement and the spread of seed squares. There are also four different playing styles to 
choose from.

As the story begins, you are outside Tresyllian Castle - the old, dark, hauntingly beautiful castle 
where Tamara now lives. Tamara greets you, and you meet some interesting guests. But your visit soon 
turns to mystery, as a trail of riddles and clues leads you to a hidden valuable treasure. 
 
But Tamara is worried about a ghost that is tormenting her. What does the ghost want? Is it jealous 
of her? Does the ghost want the hidden treasure for itself? Or is the ghost a fake - just someone 
dressing up to frighten Tamara? If so, why? 
 
Some of the characters in the game will treat you differently whether you play as a male or female 
character, and the game comes with four different variations (choosen at the start by picking a 
color).

Aliens have invaded our asteroid belt! It's up to you to get rid of them. 
Your space ship on the bottom of the vertically scrolling screen dodges and shoots at asteroids, 
hostile ships and the like. 
By moving left and right and firing rapidly, first you must clear a path through the asteroids. Only 
then you can take on the alien craft. Pushing up on the joystick increases speed, but crashing into 
an asteroid means death. A bonus is awarded if you pass through unscathed. Once on the other side, 
the aliens attack from the top and sides of the screen and drop  missiles. The first wave is just a 
teaser. Progressive waves are more aggressive and harder to kill. If you destroy a certain number of 
aliens, more asteroids must be avoided or destroyed, followed by yet another alien attack, and so on, 
until eventually all are defeated or you have no more lives.

sun in this quadrant. From time to time you will see a moon pass by, and by flying near it you can 
descend to the surface. As you sweep along the surface, you will see stranded miners which need to be 
rescued by flying over them. Also on the moons surface are various obstacles which must be avoided or 
destroyed, such as towers and lunar satellites as well as alien surface destroyers. Should you 
survive and rescue six miners (the maximum your ship can carry), then you may take off from the 
surface by using the accelerator rings. There are several different types of moons found in this 
quadrant, each with a different level of difficulty. To help out, your ship is equipped with photon 
torpedoes and shields (though you will lose points while using the shield).

to disguise yourself from your fans. You then need to find the waiting motorbike to escape to level 2 
- Michaelsville. 
Here you need to find orbs which transform your bike into the glittering Stratus car able to leap 
barriers. If you get far enough you escape via a jetski. 
Level 3 has you defending yourself in Club 30 against Mr Big's task force. 
And the final level has you in an arena fighting Mr Big's Storm Troopers and plasma cannon as

Moptown Parade (13311) (c) 1984 The Learning Co. / The Learning Co. 
 
One of the oldest releases by The Learning Company, Moptown Parade is an edutainment game aimed at 
teaching basic pattern recognition and logic skills to kids aged 4-7. The goal is simple: choose the 
traits of Moppet creatures to line up in a queue, obeying the given number of rules. For instance, if 
the rule says "2," you must choose the traits of the next Moppet so that it differs from the previous 
Moppet by 2 traits, e.g. a fat, blue Moppet can stand next to a thin, red Moppet. The number of 
rules, i.e. traits, can be changed from 1 to 4, thus either making the game more or less challenging 
(although changing the traits to 4, the maximum, will just result in your Moppets being an alternate 
sequence of two types of Moppets).

Mordon's Quest (5002) (c) 1985 
 
You have a reputation as a worthy and capable adventurer. One day you encounter an old man named 
Mordon, who explains that he is one of the Ancient Ones, who have been guiding universes in a 
positive way for centuries. However, they have been dying out through old age, and so have built a 
time machine. 
 
A younger Ancient One named Bostafer scuppered this, destroying the machine in the hope of using it 
to make himself immortal. Can you retrieve all the pieces from time and space before Bostafer?The 
pieces have attained mythical status in some cultures, so retrieving them may not be an easy task. 
 
Mordon's Quest is a pure-text IF game containing 150 locations and understanding over 400 words. 
Items you will find early in the game include a blowpipe, a black pearl and a crystal orb. Commands 
include CLIMB, SACRIFICE and INSERT, as well as standard movement and object-retrieval methods.

Mac must neutralise 18 single-screen vaults in this early platformer. He can climb ladders and safely 
fall any distance, as long as he lands on smooth ground. The puzzle aspect of the gameplay involves 
switches, which can remove walls, create floors and freeze obstacles. They must be pushed in the 
right order to allow access to parts of the room which contain other switches. A lack of air creates 
a time limit, with bonus points awarded for however much air is left when the screen is completed.

MOT is nothing less than a 3 meter tall inter-dimensional monster (complete with a tail and horns), 
which can travel through the planes of time and space as easily as you go from your bedroom to the 
kitchen. 
 
Moreover, MOT has the bad habits of hiding in your cupboard, smashing all the furniture in your house 
from time to time or eating all the food in your fridge during the night. 
And of course,  when you tried to explain to your parents that it wasn't you but MOT who crushed 
their car, they sent you to a psychiatrist. 
 
But MOT is your friend, and you wouldn't let him down when he calls for your help, would you ?

Five skill sections and four time trials await you and your dirt bike in this top-down action game. 
The hazards include boulders in the road, trees in the forests, gaps to jump and uphill slopes. Rocks 
and logs can be cleared with a simple jump action. If you don’t land on the back wheels, you could 
fall off. Climbing ramps involves carefully judging the angle, and adjusting your bike to match. You 
start off with 3 lives, and get an extra one after each of the 9 levels.

Motocross Racer is a bike racing game where you need to race through three different scenes in the 
shortest amount of time possible. Each scene takes place in a different location with a different 
perspective. First you will race through the desert with a 3-D behind the bike point of view. Rocks, 
cacti, scorpions, and other obstacles should be avoided or you'll crash and lose valuable time. Next 
you'll race a winding path uphill through the woods. This section has a top down view, and you'll 
lose time if you wander off the track or crash into obstacles. The final segment of the race takes 
place on the beach with a side scrolling point of view. Various obstacles and other racers will all 
get in your way here! If you crash too many times, or take too long the game will be over.

In this game, you control a bumper car, and the object is to bump your opponents off the gameboard 
while they do the same to you, and once you have managed to bump all your opponents off the board, 
you move on to the next round. If you take too long to complete a round, a fireball will strike one 
of the tiles on the board, causing them to collapse and making it more likely that you or your 
opponents are killed. In some rounds, you can get power-ups that give you extra bumping powers and 
the ability to jump over gaps. When you jump, you can break a tile to the point where it collapses, 
making it easier for opponents to fall down the gap that will be left there.

angling the bike so as to aim for the same slope as the land, and make sure to land on the back wheel 
to avoid falling. Any infraction loses you one of your bikes - you start with 3 but get a new one

Deep within a multi platformed diamond mine is a valuable crown. Your goal is to locate and retrieve 
the crown, then make it to the top of the mine alive! There are several steps that need to be 
completed before you can retrieve the crown. First you need to collect enough diamonds to earn 1,000 
points. After you have enough points, you need to locate the flame spirit which is hidden somewhere 
within the mine. Since the mine is rather dark, you carry a flashlight with you which can be used to 
locate objects (such as treasure chests full of diamonds and the flame spirit.) Once you have the 
flame spirit, you need to find the entrance to the temple the crown is in. Offer the flame spirit to 
the skull spirit guarding the entrance, and you can get in and take the crown. Once you have the 
crown, you need to make it to the top of the mine before time runs out. To make this task more 
challenging, numerous cave bats fly around which can steal the crown. If this happens, you need to 
begin again! At the very bottom of the mine is a deadly spider

Mr. Wimpy - The Hamburger Game (5063) (c) 1984 Ocean Software Ltd. / Ocean Software Ltd. 
 
Mr. Wimpy is a one-player game, where the character controls Mr. Wimpy whose favorite hobby is 
    making tasty hamburgers. In level one, you are required to bring back each ingredient (cheese, 
    beef patty, and sausage) separately on each of the three trays provided. 
 
Once you have done this, you'll advance a level where the gameplay changes a la Burger Time. The 
object is to make four burgers, and you do this by running over ingredients including either cheese 
or lettuce, beef patties, and the two hamburger buns, to make them fall onto the level below you 
without coming in contact with evil onions, hot dogs, and egg yolks. If you are unfortunate enough to 
come in contact with these nasties, you'll lose one of your five lives, unless you sprinkle pepper on 
them. Note that you only have a limited supply of pepper, so to get more, you need to travel to the 
top level and get cups of coffee or sundaes that move around the screen. Another way to deal with 
these enemies is to wait until one of them gets under an ingredient, and squash them by running over 
the ingredient. They will get squashed only to get resurrected somewhere on the screen. 
 
When the ingredients are at the bottom level and you run over them, they will drop onto one of the 
four burgers at the bottom of the screen. When you make all four burgers, you proceed to the next 
level. The more levels you proceed, the more difficult your quest is.

Ms. Pacman (5069) (c) 1984 General Computer Corporation|Midway / Atarisoft 
 
In 1982, a sequel to the  incredibly popular Pac-Man was introduced in the form of his girlfriend, 
Ms. Pac-Man.  This sequel continued on the "eat the dots/avoid the ghosts" gameplay of the original 
game, but added new features to keep the title fresh. 
 
Like her boyfriend, Ms. Pac-Man attempts to clear four various and challenging mazes filled with dots 
and ever-moving bouncing fruit  while avoiding Inky, Blinky, Pinky and Sue, each with their own 
personalities and tactics.  One touch from any of these ghosts means a loss of life for Ms. Pac-Man. 
 
Ms. Pac-Man can turn the tables on her pursuers by eating one of the four Energizers located 
    within the maze. During this time, the ghosts turn blue, and Ms. Pac-Man can eat them for bonus 
    points (ranging from 200, 400, 800 and 1600, progressively). The Energizer power only lasts for a 
    limited amount of time, as the ghost's eyes float back to their center box, and regenerate to 
    chase after Ms. Pac-Man again. 
 
Survive a few rounds of gameplay, and the player will be treated to humorous intermissions showing 
the growing romantic relationship between Pac-Man and Ms. Pac-Man, leading all the way up to the 
arrival of "Junior".

levels of difficulty, in the easiest the game only lasts 6 turns, but the real game is 12 turns. 
Crystite is not available at the easiest level. 
 
Each turn starts with land claim. Each player gets to choose a spot of land for themselves from the 
map. If two players choose the same spot, the player with less money wins. The map consists of 
different landscape. River is best for producing food, plains for energy, mountains for smithore. 
Crystite is hidden and must be first found by taking a land sample to the town. 
 
After the land claim each player takes turns in cultivating their land and do other tasks. They can 
buy M.U.L.E.s to start production on their land, sabotage other players by buying M.U.L.E.s and 
letting them loose, try to catch the Wumpus for cash and try to find crystite veins. The time to do 
these things depends on if the player has enough food. Finally the player goes to the casino and wins 
a small amount of money, depending on how much time was left. 
 
After the cultivation phase is the production phase where each land produces an amount of goods 
depending on a number of factors such as if the player has enough energy in storage, what type of 
land is used, and some random events such as sunspots that increase energy output. Also, if the same 
player has plots producing the same goods next to each other, they gain a bonus. Three plots of same 
production type anywhere on the map by the same player also gives a bonus. 
 
Third phase is the most interesting one: the auction. Here the players buy and sell their goods on 
open market. Players negotiate the price by moving up and down on the screen. The shop also has 
prices that depend on how abundant or scarce the goods is. So if there is a shortage of food, the 
price goes up and vice versa. This allows for interesting tactics, especially if one player manages 
to monopolize food, energy or smithore production. If there is no food, others don't have time to 
change their production types, if there is a shortage of energy, their land won't produce and if 
there are no M.U.L.E.s they can't change production type on their plot. Hoarding goods also has a 
drawback in the form of surplus where each turn a percentage of goods is wasted. 
 
There are a number of random events in the game. Some affect one player, usually the one winning gets 
small penalties and the losing player(s) get small rewards. The big events that happen randomly are: 
- M.U.L.E. goes crazy - the M.U.L.E. on one of the plots runs away losing production for that round 
  plus the money to replace it. 
- Planetquake - production of smithore and crystite is much lower. 
- Fire in store - all stock in the shops are destroyed (which means prices will skyrocket, but if 
  you needed to buy something, you are at the mercy of other players). 
- Pirate attack - pirates steal all crystite from stores and players (in the easiest level they 
  steal smithore). Nasty if you happened to have a lot of them waiting for better prices. 
- Acid rain storm - affects the plot under the storm and below it by boosting food production and 
  decreasing energy production. 
- Sunspot activity - increases energy production. 
- Pest attack - eats all food on one plot. 
- Meteor strike - destroys the M.U.L.E on the plot it strikes but creates a very rich crystite 
  plot. 
 
M.U.L.E always has four players, with 1-4 human players possible and the rest played by the AI. 
  Because the players only need two buttons at most (up/down in auction) in auction, it's easy to 
  play with four people around the computer. 
 
M.U.L.E is a very finely tuned game where rewards, penalties, time to use for various tasks etc. 
  have been perfectly fine tuned to keep the game balanced. Rules and the random events mean that no 
  two games are the same.

The year is 1936. You are in flight on the dirigible Zinderneuf, and a murder has just been 
discovered! As the only detective on board the ship, it is your job to discover who the murderer is 
before landing. The game is played from a top down view of the Zinderneuf. In order to solve the 
case, you will need to find enough evidence to accuse the correct person. Clues can be found by 
searching the various rooms, and also from interrogating the fifteen passengers on board. When you 
come across a passenger, you can question them by being polite, forceful, naive, or whatever approach 
you think will get you the most information. You can even ignore passengers, but ignoring someone now 
may make them reluctant to help you later! By piecing the evidence together you need to come up with 
the killer before time runs out. You may play the game as one of eight different detectives, and each 
time you play the killer, his/her motive, and the various clues will be different.

Mystery Master - Felony! (5121) (c) 1984 BrainBank, Inc. / CBS Software 
 
There is a crime wave in the town of Huxley! As a mystery master, you need to help the police solve 
12 different crimes that have taken place. Throughout each of the cases you can interrogate suspects, 
search for clues at various locations, or use police station resources to analyze clues. To win you 
need to find out who the criminal is within the given time limit, as well as collect enough evidence 
to convict him and send him to jail. Included with the game is a manual which contains the story for 
each of the 12 cases along with hundreds of clues. When the computer reveals clues from searches or 
questioning, it will give you a number which needs to be looked up in the manual for more 
information. To be successful, you will need to study the back story carefully and take notes as the 
plot unfolds! The game can be played by just one player, or up to four players can compete against 
each other to see who solves the case first.

Become a police detective and solve 12 murders in Micropolis.  Players interview witnesses, gather 
evidence, and sift through lab reports to get the clues they need to solve each case.  Each action, 
particularly traveling between locations, adds time to the game clock. 
 
One to four people can play, competing to see who solves the mystery first and in the optimum amount 
of time.  After the case is presented, players take turns choosing an option, getting a clue number, 
and then looking it up in the manual.  Once a player thinks they have it solved, they present their 
solution to the others.  Then he looks up the complete solution.  If it's 100% right, he wins and the 
players start on a new case. If any detail is wrong, he's out of the game and the others continue 
toward a solution.  (Note the computer requires  player honesty when asking if he got it right nor 
not.)

Mystery of the Nile, The (5125) (c) 1986 Made in Spain / Zigurat 
 
In this unofficial adaptation of the film "The Jewel of the Nile", three travelers have been captured 
by a dictatorial regime in an Arab country. They must escape the country at once, and the player is 
the only one who can help them. 
 
In the initial screens all three tourists need to be reunited from their different prison cells. Each 
character also needs to find their weapon of choice, those being grenades, a pistol and an umbrella. 
Control between any of the travelers can be switched at any moment by typing 1, 2 or 3. 
 
Once the three travelers are reunited, every screen acts as a puzzle of sorts: the player is given a 
few seconds to strategically place each character before enemies appear. When they do, two of the 
characters will react automatically to the enemies, and the player will directly control the last 
character. If all enemies in the screen are eliminated and the three characters survive, they will 
advance to the next screen.

In this platform game, you are a mere mortal who has been called by the Gods to defeat several 
mythological creatures that have been turned bad by the evil Dameron. 
 
Myth: History in the Making is a platform game with a lot of fighting. The levels of this game deal 
with different mythologies, from ancient Greece to the Vikings, over to Valhalla (where none other 
than the hammer-wielding Thor awaits you), and more. 
 
Apart from jumping from platform to platform, you'll also fight the enemies and bosses in your path 
with a variety of weapons - in the beginning you have only fists to defend yourself, but later you'll 
find more powerful weapons, such as swords and axes. There are many various types of enemies, 
different on every level. Typically, enemies keep appearing and coming at you from all sides, no 
matter how many of them you kill - so you have to keep moving. 
 
Some obstacles in the game require not only brute force, but also a bit of thinking and 
puzzle-solving (and guesswork) to get past.

Narc is a 1-2 player game, where your mission is to infiltrate the Mr. Big Corporation, the scourge 
of the underworld. To do this, you must get through the game's eight stages, with over ten sectors 
like the junkyard, subway, drug lab, nursery, downtown, Sunset Strip, and even the corporation, where 
Mr. Big resides. In order to get through the stages, you are required to collect a number of safe 
cards, and insert them in the slot next to the stage exit.  Each sector includes a map, and should be 
easy to read. For example, the blue or red dots represent you, and the white dots are the missile 
launchers, while the "E" indicates the exit. 
 
Your mission ain't going to be easy, as you will come face-to-face with enemies including the canine 
mutts, Das Lof Gang, Dr. Spike Rush, Joe Rockhead, Kinky Pinky, Sgt. Skyhigh, HQ Posse, and Mr. Big 
himself. You have two ways you can deal with them: either put a bullet in them or make arrests. 
Furthermore, they will try to blow you up the minute they see you. Fortunately, you're armed with a 
shotgun and missile launcher, but these both have a limited supply of ammunition. If your bullet 
counter reaches one, you can only fire one bullet at a time, so you need to find some more. Also, it 
is important not to waste all of your missiles: you might need them later when you deal with later 
enemies like Mr. Big. You are also backed up by a chopper and a mean shiny street machine. 
 
More often than not, when you blow up enemies, you can pick up several items that they drop, 
including drugs, money, ammunition, missile launchers, and if you're lucky, safe cards.  Even if you 
got the safe card and can pass the level, you can keep blowing up enemies to score more points. 
According to the game, this game is for training purposes only, so you will not get employed by your 
local DEA office. Is this what the DEA does every day: go on rampages?

This was the first videogame based on C.S. Lewis' ever popular Narnia series of books which started 
with The Lion, The Witch, And The Wardrobe.  The game came with the first novel, game cards and dice 
that are used in the gameplay. 
 
In the first episode, the witch has frozen Narnia and sent evil dwarves to stomp on flowers and 
beavers and to stop you from becoming strong.  You gain heart points by touching flowers and beavers 
and gradually turn Narnia green again.  You must get 10 hearts before time runs out.  If a dwarf 
comes into contact with you, he goes into a battlefield with you where you roll the dice to come up 
with a number higher than the one it gets or you lose one heart.  Edmund will appear occasionally and 
be powerless to go to the witch unless you intercept him or else the game ends. 
 
In episode 2, you are in an ice maze and must reach the lion Aslan.  The witch will send crystals at 
you which if they make contact will take away a heart.  There's three gravity chutes which if stepped 
on will send you to the bottom of the maze.  You collect flowers for extra points and if you reach a 
door, you go to a card sub-adventure.  The cards will have dice game such as the wolf Fenris Ulf will 
dare you to roll odd numbers or the witch Jadis will challenge you to get a higher second dice roll 
than your first.

NATO Commander (5147) (c) 1984 MicroProse Software, Inc. / MicroProse Software, Inc. 
 
The first wargame from legendary game designer Sid Meier, NATO Commander puts the player in charge of 
the armies of Western Europe as the Soviet-led Warsaw Pact forces plunge across central Europe in a 
hypothetical Cold War-turned-World War III scenario. 
 
The game design would serve as the foundation for the MicroProse Command Series of wargames, so it is 
no surprise that NATO Commander and those later MicroProse games are very similar.  Combat takes 
place in accelerated real-time, though the player can freeze to survey the field and issue orders.  
Commanding is basically a matter of picking the right "modes" for individual units and moving them 
into position for attack or defense, monitoring unit morale, assigning air wings to various tasks 
(air superiority, ground support, or reconnaissance), and making judicious use of the chemical and 
nuclear weapons at the player's disposal. 
 
There are four difficulty levels and five different scenarios to choose from, and the player has the 
option of using larger divisions or smaller brigades as the standard unit size.  Victory points are 
determined by political (city captures, chemical and nuclear weapons use, pre-emptive attack, etc.) 
and combat (casualties and loss of territory) factors. 
 
Key political events occur during the course of the war, such as labor strikes and declarations of 
neutrality by certain European nations.  The final outcome is eventually determined when accumulated 
political and combat losses force one of the two sides to accept defeat.

Naval Battle of Tsushima (670) (c) 1984 Avalon Hill / Avalon Hill 
 
The Japanese combined fleet and the Russian Baltic Fleet, sent over from Europe, fought in the 
straits between Korea and Japan near the island of Tsushima. The Battle of Tsushima (in Japan, it is 
called the "Sea of Japan Naval Battle") was the decisive sea battle of the Russo-Japanese war of 
1904-1905. In this battle the Japanese fleet under Admiral Heihachiro Togo destroyed 2/3 of the 
Russian fleet under Admiral Zinovi Petrovich Rozhdestvenski. You take the side of one of these 
commanders and see how well you fare in the same situation. This is a "what if" game of tyring 
different strategies to effect the outcome. 
 
The game is run in turns with the computer handling weather and executing your orders.

Take the role of a US Navy SEAL operative and embark in 3 missions involving terrorists, hostages, 
and the like. The plot is fairly superficial, since each mission is independent from the rest. 
 
Each mission has several "portions" with different types of game mechanics, making the game almost a 
series of mini-games. Swimming and submarining are among your tasks. 
 
The most predominant type of gameplay, however, consists of side-scrolling arcade action with a 
realistic basis, so you only have one life and there are no power ups available during missions.

Necromancer (5163) (c) 1983 
 
Tetragorn the Necromancer has a fleet of evil beings at his disposal, from spiders to ogres and 
Hammerfists. You play Illuminar the wizard, aiming to use the forces of light and nature to triumph 
over dark. 
 
There are three stages of play to this action game. Standing constantly in the centre of the screen, 
you must use your long-range Wisp weapon to create an army of them, while also fending off Ogres. 
Venom Spiders infect your trees - to prevent them from withering away, you must first kill the 
Spider, then hit the tree with your wisp. Eye-Pods (did Steve Jobs play this game?) can be hit to 
produce even more seeds. 
 
Trees you produce in this stage are taken with you into the vaults, which are split into five 
increasingly-tough layers. Use your wisp to activate a tree, and guide it into the Spider larvae. It 
will then grow over it, and can be replaced in the storage area once it has completed its task. 
 
Larvae which does hatch turns into Sith Spiders, which kill trees and can kill Illuminar - destroy it 
with your wisp. Hammerfists are also primarily a hindrance - they destroy trees, and if they hit you, 
you must wrestle free before the can kill you. However, they will sometimes drop strength-giving 
rings, and random-effect Mysteries. 
 
Once you reach Tetragorn's lair, you must destroy the headstones that trigger him. Once he has 
appeared, destroy him with your wisp, but above all you must avoid contact. Again, this stage takes 
place on 5 levels of increasing difficulty.

Neighbours (5169) (c) 1991 Zeppelin Games Limited / Impulze 
 
This racing game is set in the Ramsay Street universe of the Australian soap opera, which was hugely 
popular in the UK at the time. Nominally you play Scott Robinson, riding his skateboard in races 
against between one and four fellow characters – Mike Young on another skateboard, Charlene Ramsay in 
a go-kart, her brother Henry on a lawnmower, and Matt Robinson on a motorcycle. The eight races take 
in Ramsay Street, the Lassiter’s Complex, Erinsborough High School, and Anson’s Corner. There are 
three boards available (two on the Spectrum), trading top speed off against manoeuvrability. 
 
Gameplay involves guiding your craft through a series of gates around a forced-perspective course. 
There are three levels of hazard presence available – hazards include kangaroos, emus and other 
(stereotypically Australian) animals, Bouncer the dog, grotty old Mrs. Mangel, and traffic bollards. 
Contact with any of these costs you time, and popularity (reflected by a Neighbours logo fading out 
along the bottom of the screen – collecting litter will restore this).

In the year 2099, the spaceship EPIC makes another one of her journeys when she is suddenly caught in 
a plasma storm, forcing her off course into unmapped. Due to the damaged caused by the storm, the 
EPIC was forced to land on an uninhabited planet to make urgent repairs. While on the planet, the 
ship's crew had no idea that an unknown virus made its way onto the ship. Upon returning to the 
EPIC's home base of Altontron, the crew became aware that the ship had been infected by the alien 
life form. 
 
They have sent an android called NEIL to get rid of the aliens. Each room of the ship contains nine 
green aliens that NEIL needs to destroy. As well as these aliens, there are also robots that come in 
the room from time to time. When shot, these robots leave behind cells, which give NEIL extra 
ammunition, allow him to replenish his air supply, or use a smart bomb which kills all aliens in the 
room. Finding a turbo lift allows NEIL to travel between floors.

Neoclyps (5175) (c) 1983 Cymbal Software, Inc. / PSS 
 
Neoclyps is a game very similar to the game Defender  in concept. 
 
It's a side scrolling space shoot 'em up has you flying a spaceship over alien landscape. You can 
move up, down, right and left, and you can shoot. 
 
The game is quite well designed progressing from the beginner levels  (1-4) through to the Ace levels 
13 and above. 
To progress through the levels you must destroy key targets, radar bases, in the city below without 
crashing into any of the other buildings. 
The targets are cunningly placed and become more difficult to access. Fortunately, every time you 
down an enemy space ship you get a temporary shield that helps negotiate the city scape. 
 
Naturally the first four beginner levels are fairly easy, but as you get to the intermediate and 
expert levels the challenges increase and the difficulty level ramps up.

the player can pick them up and take it to the structure nearby where the player will see the 
daughters trapped in an aquarium guarded by the snake. To set her free, the player is required to

Nether Earth is arguably the first classic real time strategy. In a distant future there is a war 
between humans and ancient race of aliens called Insignian. On mysterious planet there are four bases 
to conquer and to win a war - Kerberus, Tarras, Faretra and Diolkos. Only way, how to fight, is to 
use factories to build giant battle robots, similar to Mech units in other games. Commanding robots, 
capturing factories and defeating enemy in realtime - is primary goal for player. 
 
In Nether Earth is player controlling small flying robot, instead of mouse cursor in Dune 2 and later 
RTS games. With this robot you can enter a factory, design your unique battle robot from few parts 
like wheels, antigrav, radar, laser gun or nuclear weapon. After that you have to command your robot. 
Artifical Intelligence is great for a time, but in though times is possible to control robot manualy. 
Every captured factory means difference in tactics, because of power ballance. Computer AI has no 
advantage of you, its pure strategy in real time.

You control Ed Hick, who decided to take a day trip to New York City in his red atomic Plymouth 
Continental. For a first-timer in the big city, Ed will run into some problems, namely the traffic. 
There are two types of vehicles that Ed must face. There are harmless cars cruising the streets, and 
these cars can be run over without taking any damage to yourself. There are also tow trucks that can 
easily damage your Plymouth. If it takes enough damaged or it runs out of gas, then it is hauled to 
the garage while you are recovering in the hospital. You must hot-foot it all the way to the garage 
to pick up your car and fork out $100 for repairs. If you run out of money, the game is over. 
 
However, you are free to visit the bank to get some more. If you do this, then you need to avoid a 
series of bank robbers, who constantly fire at you and prevent you from reaching the teller on the 
opposite side. If you manage to reach the teller, then you are awarded $500 and the teller will 
close. 
 
Your main objective is to visit two of the buildings, as indicated in your status bar. (Only two 
buildings are open at once.) To view a site, you must find a parking space close by, get out of the 
car, and walk into the building. Each building contains a mini-game that must be completed before it 
can be deemed as 'seen'. Meanwhile, your car is metered, and if the parking meter expires, then it is 
towed away to the lot and you have to make your way to the lot to pick it up. The whole game must be 
completed in a day.

Newzealand Story, The (5196) (c) 1989 Taito Corporation / Imagine Software 
 
One day, a kiwi tribe was having fun and games outside the zoo, only to be kidnapped by the 
evil-minded Leopard Seal, who plans to sell them at the black market. Fortunately, during the 
kidnapping process, Tiki, leader of the tribe, managed to escape the sack, and her job is to rescue 
Phee-Phee and the other kiwis scattered around New Zealand, and are held in cages in various 
locations that include Auckland, Rotorua, Waitomo Caves, Strait Cook, and Mt. Cook. 
 
If Tiki doesn't rescue a kiwi in a limited amount of time, the devil will appear and try to kill her. 
When Tiki reaches the outskirts of each city, except Strait Cook, there is a boss waiting to meet 
Tiki, and kill her by using their own choice of weapons. Also making the rescue mission difficult are 
several nasties that attempt to throw their own weapons, like bombs and arrows, at her. To defeat 
these enemies, Tiki shoots at them using her crossbow and arrows. More often than not, when Tiki 
shoots at enemies, they will leave behind pieces of fruit that she can pick up for points. However, 
it is likely that Tiki may get other weapons or the letters E, X, T, E, N, and D. Collecting all 
these letters will result in an extra life, and as for the weapons, they include laser shots, bombs, 
and fireballs. 
 
In some levels, a few areas are located further up than just left or right, and the only way that 
Tiki can go up is by snatching something off the enemy that gives her the ability to fly up. Other 
areas are underwater, and when Tiki goes underwater, her oxygen  meter decreases, so she has to rise 
up to the surface again to restore her oxygen levels. Apart from her own weapons, Tiki is able to

Nick Faldo Plays the Open (5204) (c) 1985 
 
Nick Faldo Plays The Open is a golfing game for one player. The object is to complete a round of golf 
in as few strokes as possible. 
 
Game features : 
 
1. based on a real course the Royal St. George's golf course of Sandwich, England, 
2. keyboard of joystick control, 
3. definable keys, 
4. options to play either a full round, play out (holes 1 - 9), play in (holes 10-18), or play any 
   individual hole. 
 
Game play : 
The game screen is divided horizontally into two parts. Initially the top half of the screen is used 
to display the game setup menus, control method, keyboard key definition, etc. Once this has been 
completed the top half of the screen displays the map of the course and the bottom half of the screen 
is used to set up each stroke. The map in the top half of the screen can be toggled between a large 
or small scale view to enable the player to line up their shot. 
 
The lower half of the screen consists of seven 'windows'. Two of these are information and show wind 
speed,and course information such as length and par for the current hole, strokes taken for this hole 
and for the match so far. A third toggles between a large and a small scale map of the course, three 
more set up the stroke and the last plays the stroke. 
To make a stroke the player first moves the cursor to the club selection box where they can cycle 
through the available clubs :- putter, driver, wedge, 3 and 5 woods, a 3, 5, 7 and 9 irons. 
 
The player then sets both the strength and direction of the shot before moving the cursor to the 
central box where a little animation plays, the caddy hands over the appropriate club and the shot is 
played. As the stroke is being played it is possible to fine-tune the shot and adjust the direction 
and strength. 
 
Once the ball has been struck in the lower part of the screen, the upper part of the screen shows a 
top down view of the ball travelling over the course. When the ball has come to rest the player 
repeats the cycle until the ball is in the hole. The process is repeated until the game is complete

Nick Faldo's Championship Golf (5205) (c) 1992 Arc Developments / Grandslam Video Ltd. 
 
Arc Developments created a 3D game world called Reality3 for this simulation, licensed around one of 
Britain's top players. There are two courses, plus a hidden 9-hole course on Mars with reduced 
gravity, with match play and stroke play options against one of 8 varied-difficulty computer players. 
 
The control system is quite unusual, as the strength of the shot is chosen before you start the 
swing, but you have to click within a range to activate the shot, and this range is narrower if your 
shot is intended to be more powerful. An extra click can be made to add wrist snap, which increases 
the shot's power. The wind calculation is more complicated than most games of the era, and the rough 
is harder to play out of than usual, as you can't make slight stance adjustments easily.

Night Driver (5210) (c) 1982 Atari, Inc. / Commodore Electronics Ltd. 
 
Night Driver is an action racing game which takes place at night! Your goal is to score as many 
points as possible by racing through one of four different tracks. Points are scored by passing 
checkpoints located throughout the track. If your car crashes into the side of the road, oncoming 
cars, or any other obstacles, you will lose all of your speed and a lot of time! The game ends when 
the 90 second time limit is up. The four tracks you can choose from are beginner, pro, expert, and 
random (this track is different every time and can not be memorized like the other three). Several 
game options are included which allows you to select whether or not other cars will honk before 
entering the screen, and choose between a 90 second or infinite amount of time for a game.

to be held at night, and each car must be fitted with explosives with built-in timers, which can only 
be defused at official checkpoints. 
 
Players must drive their cars through the dark pine forests, avoiding green cars in an attempt to 
out-position the yellow car of the race leader. But players must complete each stage within a 
reasonable amount of time, or they are out of the game.

Night Shade (5218) (c) 1985 Ultimate - Play the Game / Firebird Software Ltd. 
 
Between the Seas of the Seven Islands and the purple Mountains lies a valley. Time was that this area 
was safe and hospitable, however darkness then came - killing many of the inhabitants and warping the 
minds of the others. Many have gone there, none have returned - can you be the first? 
 
Nightshade is an arcade adventure in scrolling isometric 3D (an advance on earlier Ultimate titles 
such as Knight Lore, which were flick-screen), with directional or rotational controls. You can take 
3 hits from the various roaming monsters - turning from white to yellow to green as you take them - 
but a 4th costs you one of your five lives. Objects can be thrown at these foes, but only if you have 
any. 
 
The map is made up of medieval-style buildings, which are visible while you are on the outside but 
whose roofs lift when you enter them, to ensure full visibility. There are four super-villains to 
destroy (a mad monk, a skeleton, a ghost, and Mr Grimreaper), and you must find the right objects to 
do this.

Strange signals are coming from the moon and Charlemagne Fotheringham-Grunes (or Charlie for short), 
member of the International Commission for Universal Problem Solving (I.C.U.P.S.) is sent to 
investigate. It turns out that the source of the signals is a strange monolith. The aim of the game 
is to destroy this monolith. 
 
Nodes of Yesod is an Arcade Adventure seen from a side-scrolling perspective. Charlie can jump and, 
after finding it first, use a device called mole. After pressing up on on the joystick, Charlie 
stands still and the player gains control over the mole that can be used to attack enemies. However, 
not all enemies can be harmed by the mole. Another useful device is the burrowing chum that can be 
used to dig through certain walls. Before Charlie can reach the monolith, he has to explore the many 
caverns of the moon and find eight keys or alchiems. Every now and then a red spaceman will show up, 
and touching him will cause Charlie to loose one of his keys.

Cyrus T. Gross has built the TALOS asteroid and directed it towards earth. Only the Nemesis 
Organisation's Mobile Attack Droid 471 can save humanity now. 
 
In N.O.M.A.D., players take control of the Mobile Attack Droid 471 as it ventures through the city, 
in this top-view shooter. Players begin with four lives. The Droid moves with considerable inertia 
(although some rooms disable this), and control involves using left and right to rotate it, pushing 
forward to provide thrust in the direction it is facing, and pushing backwards to reverse. 
 
The early part of the route is linear, but later on there are junctions to plan around. Moving 
enemies, spawning points and wall-mounted guns are the main threats. There are many switches along 
the walls, which open the sealed doors located throughout the levels, although a switch doesn't 
automatically operate on the nearest door. The game features regular checkpoints, which will restore 
the droid to that point after the lose a life. Points are awarded constantly for survival, and for 
shooting the enemies and other targets.

Nosferatu the Vampyre (5301) (c) 1986 Design Design / Piranha 
 
This game shares two major similarities to The Great Escape - firstly, it's licensed around a 
venerable film, using the setting to new effect. Secondly, it's isometrically-viewed (with monochrome 
graphics, even on the capable-of-far-better C64) and features full object interaction of the 
Filmation style - this is taken further here, as the physics of the objects are varied by their shape 
and centre of gravity. 
 
There are three stages to complete. In the first you play Johnathan Harker, who must retrieve some 
papers (he works for an Estate Agent's) and escape the castle. The second level introduces 
Johnathan's wife Lucy, and van Helsing, with play switching between the three. Lucy's role is 
slightly different as it is she who pursues the vampire itself, and she takes on the task alone in 
level 3. 
 
Food must be collected to keep the characters' strength up, and crucifixes and candles can be picked 
up to help matters.

Nova (5306) (c) Jul, 1993 
 
Nova follows a similar premise as Deflector, that is, the player has to manipulate one or or more 
beams of light in such a way that they reach a certain spot. This can be done by placing tiles on the 
playing field. There are tiles that change the direction of a beam by 90 degrees, blocks that cannot 
be penetrated, blocks that are destroyed by the light and slow it down for a moment, tubes that allow 
the light to pass through itself and "bubbles" that break the light and send it off into two 
different directions. The type of tiles available and the total number of tiles the player is allowed 
to use differs from level to level.

Just like its predecessor, Nova 2 requires the player to guide one or more beams of light to a 
certain spot. In order to manipulate the beam, different tiles can be placed on the playing filed, 
these include: tiles that change the direction of the beam by 90 degrees, blocks that cannot be 
penetrated, blocks that are destroyed by the light and slow it down for a moment, tubes that prevent 
the beam from being blocked by another beam and "bubbles" that break the light and send it off into 
two different directions. While the gameplay remains the same, the number of stages has been greatly 
increased as there are six levels with 32 stages each. A level editor is also included.

conducting espionage, building bombers,missiles,submarines and anti ballistic missiles either you or 
your neighbor launch a pre-emptive first strike.The nuclear destruction continues until either  all 
weapons are expended or a truce is negotiated. Victory is determined by population remaining and 
world political opinion which is usually against the side that started the war. If both sides lose 
enough people neither will win.

Southeast Asia, Central America, and the Persian Gulf. While in port you can choose to equip your 
ship with a variety of weapons, then take off to rid an area of hostile enemies. In battle the view 
is from the deck of the boat, allowing enemies to be targeted and destroyed.

Octapolis (5339) (c) 1987 English Software Company, The / English Software Company, The 
 
By the year 3897 the Galactic Imperium had conquered almost the entire galaxy. Only the planet 
Octapolis could resist the empire with telekinetic powers that turned the best pilots into bumbling 
idiots and caused the most sophisticated A.I.s to blow a fuse. However, after 200 years of searching, 
the Galactic intelligence Agency found a pilot immune to the effects of the mental powers and sent 
him to deactivate Octapolis' defenses. 
 
Your task is to conquer all eight cities and deactivate the planet's defense system. Each level is 
divided into a shooter and a platformer portion. During the shooter portion, the screen is split in 
half showing your ship from the side and from above. This means you cannot only move the ship 
forward, backward, up and down, but also to the left and to the right (by holding down the 
fire-button which enables you to control the ship's sideway movements in the bottom half of the 
screen). The ship fires automatically and once a certain number of enemies is destroyed or a time 
limit is reached, you have to maneuver your ship onto a certain spot and enter the city. 
 
Inside the cities you must jump and shoot your way through five screen-sized rooms. Destroying "evil 
eyes" will reward you with bonus points. All other enemies cannot be damaged by your weapon and have 
to be avoided, which is made difficult by the fact that you cannot control your jump in the air. 
After leaving the last room you continue to the next city.

at each junction in the game.  The goal is to survive and find food while avoiding hostile creatures 
and exploring the lake. 
 
There are two ways to play, "go exploring" or "play for points."  In "play for points" mode the 
player is assigned a random species of fish to play as and earns points for making the best decision 
in each encounter. 
 
Species of fish include rainbow trout, whitefish, and mackinaw trout.  There are other living things 
around the lake as well including fishermen, plankton and otters.

Official Father Christmas Game, The (2689) (c) 1989 Enigma Variations Ltd. / Alternative Software 
Ltd. 
 
The game is set on Christmas Eve, with Santa (Father Christmas) rushing to deliver presents to the 
entire world. 
 
After the player enters his/her name (which is used later in the personal letter to Santa), the first 
level takes the form of a flip-screen collecting game with Santa at home gathering the scattered 
pieces of his sleigh. If he collides with one of the elves running around, the item he is carrying is 
lost and has to be found again. 
 
The player chooses six presents they want (computer, doll, book, etc.), which are listed on their 
letter to Santa. Santa then collects the presents as they fall from the top of the screen. 
 
Finally Santa can deliver the presents, riding his sleigh over several horizontally-scrolling 
continents. The presents are dropped with parachutes and should be delivered to the homes indicated 
by arrows. Clouds and aeroplanes can knock them off course.

Oil Barons (5356) (c) 1983 Epyx, Inc. / Epyx, Inc. 
 
Oil Barons is a turn based strategy game for one to eight players. The object of the game is to 
accumulate the most wealth by locating and drilling for oil. During the game you will need to survey 
different lands ranging from the arctic to the desert for oil potential, choose the best sites and 
drill! Congress may pass bills from time to time which forbid drilling in parks and other reserved 
lands, which may or may not affect a players strategy. Several modes of gameplay are featured, 
including  regular classic, reality mode (oil locations are more randomized at the beginning of the 
game, and costs are supposed to more closely resemble those in real life), and customized modes. 
Included with the game is a game board with a 50x40 grid of the landscapes you can drill in, and 
dozens of game pieces to keep track of which locations belong to a player and where oil has (or has 
not) been discovered. This makes Oil Barons resemble a board game, but with a computer to do the 
bookkeeping and add a random element instead of dice.

the round scenario of a Plaza in which players have total freedom of movement (just like the bull), 
the objective being to score as much points as possible by passing the animal with the best arts. 
Players will also have the possibility to take off the "capote" (cloth) in order to run faster and 
distract the beast in one of those moments of maximum danger. But in case the bull does attack, no 
problem, the player just has to wake up and take the capote again.

Ollie's Follies is a simple 2D sci-fi platformer displaying the kind of horizontally layered 
environments Frank Cohen became well known for. Each level's objective is disarmingly simple - just 
get from one end of the screen to the other. These contain teleports, guard robots to avoid, and an 
array of complex ledges to navigate. Later screens add moving platforms, laser bolts and deflectors, 
and require a key be collected to open the door. Be careful not to fall too far, as this costs you 
one of your five lives, as does contact with a robot.

time. 
 
Collect all eight ingredients and Eugine Portcullis III Jnr. will be scared away for good.

saved to disk. The other is faster-paced, with the Flow-Control feature for easier shooting. 
 
Shot time limit and match length can be varied, as can kit and court colours. Long range shots and 
slam-dunks are all available. The game features 9 years of historical statistics for teams and 
players.

On Court Tennis (5388) (c) 1984 Gamestar / Activision (UK) Limited 
 
In this tennis game, the focus is on timing and directing your shots accurately, as the computer 
moves your player into position. The positive result of this is that you can (and to win must) play 
angled volleys and precisely-placed lob and drop shots. The gameplay is thus more tactical than many 
tennis games

On the Tiles (5398) (c) 1987 Odin Computer Graphics Ltd. / Firebird Software Ltd. 
 
In the low light areas of a city, a stray cat is out to prove that it is the meanest cat in the 
neighborhood. To do this, it must prowl the streets looking for fish bones. When it has eaten enough 
of these, it is able to move on to the next territory. 
 
While searching for them, it must also be on the lookout for hawks, hedgehogs, and frogs. These must 
be avoided by either jumping over them or spitting at them. The cat's energy is drained if it comes 
into contact with any of these, but eating sparrows and mice will replenish some of its energy. 
Another problem is fleas, which get into its coat. If more than ten fleas are in its coat, then one 
of the cat's lives are lost. Finally, other cats are patrolling the streets looking for the same 
things, so there is likely to be a cat fight or two. 
 
People living on the street don't appreciate cats walking around the backyard. These people throw 
buckets or boots if it gets close to their front door. One of the neighbors owns a dog who is on the 
lookout for any cats that approach him. If the cat gets near him, he will be eaten and it will lose a 
life.

Operation Thunderbolt (5431) (c) 1990 Taito Corporation / Ocean Software Ltd. 
 
Operation Thunderbolt is the exciting sequel to Operation Wolf. An airliner is hijacked by terrorists 
en-route from Paris to Boston, who threaten to kill all hostages on board if their mates aren't 
released from jail. Instead of reaching its destination, the airliner makes a landing in Kalubya, 
Africa, and all the hostages are hidden in various locations. The authorities have asked the hero 
from Operation Wolf to rescue the hostages, but only this time, the hero brings his friend along for 
the ride. 
 
There are eight missions to complete in Operation Thunderbolt, and each one has you shooting down 
soldiers, choppers, and tanks. The gameplay varies every one or two missions. In some missions, you 
are driving a jeep or controlling a boat, while in others, you are walking while you're shooting. You 
have a limited supply of ammo, and a limited supply of rocket bombs, but you can always stock up by 
shooting down crates falling from the sky, or by killing a cat or dog that get in the line of fire. 
Also from crates, you can get special items like bulletproof vests, rocket bombs, and different 
weapons. 
 
You also have a life bar to worry about. If you're shot at by soldiers, or if rocket bombs or 
grenades are thrown at you, you 'll lose energy, and once you're energy is depleted,  you lose one of 
your three lives. You can lose a lot of energy by killing hostages on purpose,  and you can't easily 
avoid killing them if you decide to use rocket bombs to wipe out enemies. The eighth mission, the 
mission that involves you fighting terrorists on a plane,  proves to be difficult because a woman in 
a blue dress stands up and gets in the line of fire, and you have to very careful when you're going 
to use rocket bombs. 
 
There are two endings to this game, and which ending you can watch will depend on the number of 
hostages you've saved, and whether or not you shot the pilot instead of the mission eight boss.

Operation Wolf (5433) (c) 1989 Taito Corporation / Taito America Corporation 
 
You have been recruited for Operation Wolf, a desperate attempt to rescue prisoners from the enemy. 
Through a series of missions, you'll engage a variety of enemies, from soldiers to ninjas, patrol 
boats to helicopters, and more. Can you carry the day? 
 
Operation Wolf is an arcade conversion of the game by Taito. It is essentially a bitmapped 
"rail-shooter", where you basically hold the gun and shoot just about everything that moves, while 
conserving your ammo and grenades. Shoot ammo/grenades and healing items on the screen to "pick them 
up". Your primary machine gun can kill everything if you hit it enough times, but you can also use 
the grenade launcher for really deadly targets like helicopters or armored cars. You can collect a 
machine gun which will allow you to shoot faster for a few seconds. 
 
You'll be pummelled by a LOT of enemies. Some will be shooting, others will be tossing grenades, 
knifes, and more. Some are armored and requires more than a few hits, others dodges. You can shoot 
grenades and knifes out of the air if you aim well enough. There are also civilians running around 
which can be shot, but it's not beneficial. 
 
Bosses appear at the end of some levels, and each has a specific weakness you need to exploit.

As an Irish prospector named Timothy O'Riley, dig an unending series of mines searching for coal, 
gold, diamonds, rubies, and oil.  But watch out for the evil creatures you've disturbed and the 
rising underground river - don't let either one touch you or you will die!  And beware - the 
creatures move much faster while the moon is up. 
The river is unstoppable, but you can kill or block the creatures with a limited supply of dynamite. 
 
O'Riley's Mine is essentially a high-speed variant of Mr. Do! and Boulder Dash - you must race around 
collecting everything before returning to the top of the mine shaft while the creatures chase you and 
the water rises relentlessly.

Ormus Saga, The II - Guild of Death (5460) (c) 1993 
 
The Ormus saga looks very similar to the early parts of the Ultima series. You live in Barryland, 
which has been taken over by the Ormus cult and now you have decided to do something about it. The 
quest starts near the city of Remfield at the southwest shores of Berryland. 
 
You can create your own character or simply start with the premade one and when you start the game 
you will be near a hostile town. You have very limited troops available at the start so   attacking 
at this time is of no use. Around the world are treasures you can find to finance more troops and 
there are other places of interest as well like temples, castles and villages to visit. Along the way 
you will face monsters you can fight for experience and gold. The ultimate goal is to destroy the 
Ormus cult in their stronghold. The controls are keyboard based and doing things like entering a town 
and besieging are done using a menu system. 
 
The Ormus saga differs from other RPG's, as it also contains troop battles during a siege of a town 
or castle.

Osprey! is an educational game based at Loch Garten in Scotland and developed in conjunction with the

to help the ospreys successfully nest, rear young and survive the hazards that threaten them. 
 
The player is appointed as leader of the RSPB project, 'Save the Ospreys!' The game can be started 
from any year between 1965 and 1979 and ends in 1981 or when all ospreys have been lost, the earlier 
the start year the harder the game. The number of wardens available each season varies, so some 
seasons there may be a shortage while at other times tasks may be easier. Weather also has an effect 
on the results. 
 
The wardens can be allocated to three areas

Two missions are on offer at a time, one tougher but more lucrative than the other, with half the 
money paid upfront and the other half on successful completion. Before setting off, you can buy 
upgrades such as turbo chargers, armour and enhanced weapons, each of which has a limited lifespan. 
Attacks from other vehicles can come either from guns or attempting ramming, and the roads are

Overlord (9835) (c) 1990 Probe Software Ltd. / Virgin Mastertronic Ltd. 
 
Overlord is a real-time strategic warfare game where the player must manage large standing armies, 
economic capital, and political stability throughout a number of extra-dimensional star systems. 
 
As the dictatorial ruler of the Epsilon Galaxy, the player has obtained complete, indisputable 
authority. However, during a scientific experiment in hyperdrive technology, Epsilon scientists 
discovered four "buffer" dimensions, each containing a number of barren planets that exist between 
the Epsilon Galaxy and another alien dimension. Unfortunately, the most powerful empires from these 
alternate dimensions have also just discovered these zones through their own experiments. The player 
must battle these alien species for control of these buffer worlds, to ensure that their rule in the 
Epsilon Galaxy remains intact. 
 
To make the new planets useful in the player's campaign, they can purchase terraforming equipment 
which can transform them into tropical Gaian-esque worlds which are ideal for agriculture, 
mineral-rich and heavily volcanic worlds, desert planets capable of producing vast amounts of energy, 
or ecologically balanced planets that can support large cities which are readily able to generate 
significant income through taxation. In addition, the player can mine for resources and tax their 
citizens to raise money, construct spaceship-buildings to feed the populace, enlist soldiers and 
equip them, buy battle cruisers or other craft to move from planet to planet, and so on. The player 
can fight battles, colonize planets, and even spy on alien races. The end goal is to ensure that the 
other alien races do not gain the upper hand by conquering these four new dimensions before the 
player can. 
 
The player cannot retreat from battle, as the only way to shut down the hyperspace link from their 
universe to Epsilon would be by vaporizing the player's homeworld, which is where the hyperspace 
generator is located. Politically (at the very least), this is not an option. 
 
Blood will have to be shed for supremacy of the hyperspace planets, and for the player to become 
Overlord of these four new dimensions plus their own.

P-47 (5504) (c) 1990 NMK Co. Ltd. / Firebird Software Ltd. 
 
The P-47 was one of the toughest planes in use in World War 2, and this side-scrolling shoot 'em up 
puts you in control of one as you take on hordes of Nazis. 16-bit versions have a simultaneous 
2-player mode, as well as the ability to wrap-around the game with increased difficulty up to 4 
times. 
 
You are initially armed with a machine gun, but can also pick up bombs, spray missiles and 
multi-missiles by picking up the appropriate letter. Each weapon can be upgraded by picking up 
further tokens of the same type. Tokens offering extra lives and speed-ups are also on offer.

Pac-Land (5510) (c) 1988 Namco Limited / Quicksilva Ltd. 
 
Pac-Land is a side-scrolling 1-2 player game with a cartoony feel to it. Now equipped with arms, 
   face, and legs, Pac must guide a fairy back to her home in Fairy Land, but this task will not be 
   easy because Inky, Blinky, Pinky, Clyde, and Sue will pursue Pac-Man as he travels through 
   Pac-Land. When he finally transports the fairy back to her home, Pac is given some magic shoes, 
   which will help him get to his own home, where he will be greeted by his family: Ms. Pac-Man, Baby 
   Pac-Man, Chomp Chomp, and Sourpuss. 
 
There are sixteen rounds to complete, with four trips each. During each round, he can grab a power 
pellet, which cause ghosts to turn blue, allowing Pac-Man to eat them for points. Points are also 
awarded by collecting fruit that appear, like cherries and strawberries. In some rounds, Pac must use 
a springboard to jump over a lake. He must also make it to the end of each round before time runs 
out, otherwise a ghost will chase him.

Pac-Man (5511) (c) 1983 Namco Limited / Atarisoft 
 
One of the most popular and influential games of the 1980's, Pac-Man stars a little, yellow 
dot-muncher who works his way around to clear a maze of the various dots and fruit which inhabit the 
board. 
 
Pac-Man's goal is continually challenged by four ghosts: The shy blue ghost Bashful (Inky), the 
   trailing red ghost Shadow (Blinky), the fast pink ghost Speedy (Pinky), and the forgetful orange 
   ghost Pokey (Clyde).  One touch from any of these ghosts means a loss of life for Pac-Man. 
 
Pac-Man can turn the tables on his pursuers by eating of the four Energizers located within the 
   maze.  During this time, the ghosts turn blue, and Pac-Man can eat them for bonus points.  This 
   only lasts for a limited amount of time, as the ghost's eyes float back to their center box, and 
   regenerate to chase after Pac-Man again. 
 
Survive a few rounds of gameplay, and be treated to humorous intermissions between Pac-Man and the 
ghosts.

Pacmania (10730) (c) 1983 Mr Chip Software / Mr Chip Software 
 
Not to be confused with Pac-Mania by Namco, this is a Pac-Man clone where the object is to eat dots 
and power pills. Several ghosts appear in their hideout at the center of the maze, and these ghosts 
will eventually make their way through the maze, chasing Pac-Man wherever he goes. However, eating 
the power pills cause the ghosts to turn blue, allowing Pac-Man to hunt a ghost down and then eat it 
for bonus points, which are also awarded for eating a fruit that appears somewhere within the maze. 
Warp tunnels are located at either side of the screen, and these can be used to get away from ghosts 
that are on Pac-Man's tail. 
 
Besides power pills, also scattered around the maze are white H icons. If Pac-Man comes in contact 
with any of these icons, he will be teleported to anywhere in the maze. Once Pac-Man eats all the 
dots and power pills in the maze, he will advance to the next one where its structure differs from 
the previous one.

Pac-Mania (5513) (c) 1988 Namco Limited / Grandslam Entertainments Ltd. 
 
Pac-Mania is a variation on the game Pac-Man. You need to guide Pac-Man around a maze and eat all 
   of the dots on the board in order to proceed on to the next round. Numerous, multi-colored ghosts 
   also roam the maze trying to stop you. If you eat one of the power pellets in the maze, the ghosts 
   will temporarily turn blue and run from you. Pac-man can earn bonus points by eating the ghosts 
   when they are in this state. The maze is now in 3-D and is larger than screen which will scroll to 
   follow the action. To help get out of tight spots, Pac-Man now has the ability to jump. But be 
   careful, because some of the ghosts have learned this trick as well and you could end up in a mid 
   air collision!

Paladin (5530) (c) 1983 Triad Software / Triad Software 
 
Players pilot a spaceship through space inhabited by aliens, and below the spacecraft is terrain 
where several human prisoners resides. The aliens, who also shoot projectiles at the player, make 
their way toward the terrain and attempt to kidnap the prisoners by taking them to the top then 
killing them. The player must prevent this from happening by shooting the aliens down and catching 
the falling prisoner with their spaceship. If the player fails to catch prisoners before they reach 
the terrain, that prisoner will be killed. 
 
Like Defender, players need to keep an eye on both the action and the map at the top of the screen, 
so that they can avoid any dangers approaching them. As well as lasers which the player can use to 
kill aliens, smart bombs can be activated, wiping all aliens in sight. Once all humans have been 
saved and all aliens killed, the player proceeds to the next wave where new aliens are introduced and 
the difficulty level is increased. 
 
If the player comes into contact with any of the aliens or their projectiles, the player loses a 
life. If the player has no lives left, the game is over.

Pang is a platform game which consists of 50 levels in total. It can be played with one or two 
players on the same screen, and the other player can join anytime within the game. 
 
Your goal is to destroy the balloons which bounce around the playfield. To accomplish this, you can 
shoot hooks which travel upwards, and blow up any balloon they touch. Depending on their size, they 
either split on two smaller ones, or evaporate if they're at their minimum size. Apart from balloons, 
some levels also have barriers that have to be destroyed with your hooks, since they often block your 
access to balloons. There are also some barriers which cannot ever be destroyed. Your character has 
the ability to climb ladders, but cannot jump. 
 
You can also pick up power-ups such as: the ability to fire two shots at once, the hook that attaches 
to the ceiling and waits 'til something bumps into it, a gun which has a high rate of fire but cannot 
destroy barriers. Beside extra weapons, you can also pick certain things like clock (halting time for 
a small period), dynamite (reducing all balls to minimum size, thus making you able to reach more 
points), life, and such.

Do you have what it takes to become a park ranger? This game will test you to see if you're really up 
to the job. You play a park ranger, whose job is to collect twelve items scattered around the park, 
such as soda cans, bottles, and balls. Unfortunately, getting these items is not as easy as it 
sounds, as your task gets difficult by swimmers, swamps, snakes, turtles, and ants. To make matters 
worse, your energy gets depleted quickly, so to restore it, you can either return to your hut, or 
snatch food off an ant's back in later levels. More often than not, some of the turtles will follow 
you into the lake. If they enter the lake, you can run them over for 500 points before they decide to 
jump back out again. 
 
Besides collecting items, you also must rescue swimmers that are about to drown in the lake. Fail to 
rescue a swimmer in a limited amount of time, and you'll also drown, and the same can be said if you 
bump into snakes. Rather than collecting items, you  can also roll on logs. Doing this will earn you 
5000 points if you manage to roll for a long time. There are five levels of Park Patrol to complete, 
and once you complete all of them, the diffculty level gets higher and the game becomes much more 
difficult. To give you an example, the turtles will stop at nothing to kill you, and there will be 
more than one swimmer to rescue at once. 
 
This game can have two players. Park Patrol even provides you with a menu, in which you can alter the 
number of turtles, ants, swamps, swimmers, and snakes in each of the five levels. With the menu, you 
can have none of these in every level, but what's the fun of completing a level without any enemies 
to avoid? Also, you can play as a boy or a girl.

Collecting tokens awards Parky with 9000 time units. If players run out of time units, or if they 
crash into a creature or wall, a life is lost. The game is over when all lives have been lost.

Pastfinder (5582) (c) 1984 Activision, Inc. / Activision, Inc. 
 
Pastfinder is a vertically scrolling action game which takes place in the year 8878. You are a member 
of an elite team of explorers known as the Pastfinders. Your goal is to search deadly, radiated 
planets for various artifacts and time capsules and to deliver them safely to a base. 
 
At the beginning of each level, you will be presented with the map screen and can select which sector 
you would like to explore next. At first, only a small portion of the map will be visible but as you 
make your way through the game additional portions become visible. The amount of radiation in each 
sector may vary, and the map is color coded to indicate just how deadly a particular sector may be. 
Next you will have an opportunity to equip your ship with supplies

Patton vs Rommel (5590) (c) 1987 
 
A turn-based war game set in World War II that simulates a what-if battle between General Patton and 
Field Marshal Rommel for control of Normandy, hence the name. 
 
As the war is fought you get points, and the objective, of course is to gather as much points as 
possible (positive points if you're Allied, negative if you're Axis). Although it's strategical 
simulation is rather simplistic, taking a more entertaining approach, it has many features, available 
options and a lot of feedback from the computer (including tips from the computerized Patton's and 
Rommel's). 
 
The game had a feature very similar to today's well-known Fog-of-War, though it's functionality was 
not as smooth as it is today. The warzone is divided into Zones of Control, with it's units and 
actions invisible to the adversary until he attempts to move through it and fight for it.

Pawn, The (5594) (c) 1986 Magnetic Scrolls / Rainbird Software 
 
The aim of this interactive fiction with graphics is to escape from the land of Kerovnia, where 
strange occurrences are routine. The Roobikyoub dwarves have been banished from the kingdom, which is 
not good as they produce high-quality whisky. King Erik is not popular for this decision, as some 
feel that ale brewers and mineral water bottlers have influenced him. Honest John the trader and 
Kronos the Magician play a key role in your journey, each offering sub-quests to attempt. 
 
The package includes a novella complete with map and decipherable hints, which are accessed by typing 
'hint' followed by the code into the computer. Therefore, those with only a pirated copy would 
struggle to complete the game. 
 
Your score and the number of locations visited are both displayed in the title bar. The parser allows 
whole words to be deleted and unaccepted previous entries to be re-edited.

Pedro (5608) (c) 1984 Creative Technology Group Ltd. / Imagine Software 
 
Pedro's flower gardens are famed throughout Mexico - unfortunately for him, information as to their 
quality appears to have reached the animal kingdom. His prized flowers are under attack from hordes 
of animals, which must be stopped. 
 
Pedro's task is to set up blockades and barriers to cut off the animals' routes to his flowers. He 
will have to take multiple trips to block off any particular path. Smaller animals can also be 
stopped by stamping on them. 
 
When flowers are eaten, Pedro must replenish them by planting seeds - allowing time for them to grow, 
as the game is lost if all the seeds are gone. As well as the animals, he must watch out for the 
Tramp, who tries to steal his seeds. 
 
The game is viewed in a 3D forced perspective, although movement is purely 2D.

well as a simultaneous 2-player mode. There's also an editor allowing you to design the cavern layout 
yourself, and save your creations to tape.

The penguin can push iceblock away to arrange the board or to crush monsters. There are two ways for 
wining a level: crushing every monster on the current board or collecting the three diamonds. At the 
end of a level, the time elapsed is used for score calculation. 
The penguin can be moved in four directions with a joystick or the keypads and the fire button is 
used to push the blocks.

Perseus & Andromeda (5637) (c) 1983 
 
Perseus & Andromeda is Number 9 in the Mysterious Adventures series. As the title implies, this one 
involves Greek mythology involving characters Perseus and Andromeda. Hero Perseus must slay Medusa 
and rescue Princess Andromeda  who will then become his bride. To accomplish this, he must arm 
himself with a sword, shield and sandals. 
 
This game follows the Perseus mythology story closely (as seen in the movie "Clash of the Titans" for 
example).  Many puzzles involve giving an object to someone, who then gives Perseus another object. 
Entering temples and praying can produce plot-advancing events. 
 
Around this time, the game engine was redone to allow complete sentences instead of the more 
primitive 2-word Scott Adams parser that had been used previously, although early versions of the 
game may have still used the cruder parser.

Licensed around former England player Peter Beardsley, this football (soccer) game is viewed side-on. 
The only playing option is the European Championship tournament of the day, although you can choose 
the 8 teams from the 26 major European footballing nations of the time (so the USSR, Czechoslovakia 
and Yugoslavia are all still complete). Two players can compete in these groups, but there's no 
guarantee of getting straight to a 2-player game, especially as tournaments (and individual matches) 
can't be quit out of. 
 
The gameplay features variable strength kicks, determined by how long you hold the fire button for. 
In a break with realistic physics, the ball ricochets back in the direction it came from. Goalkeepers 
stay on the goal-line rather than using the whole penalty box.

Phantom of the Asteroid (5663) (c) 1985 Mastertronic Ltd. / Mastertronic Ltd. 
 
A giant asteroid is heading toward Earth, and the only way to destroy it is to find 36 uranium cubes 
and gather them in one place. You are equipped with a jet-pack which you use to navigate the 
asteroid, but it has a limited amount of fuel, and when it is running low, you need to refill at the 
fuel depots scattered around the asteroid. Your oxygen also depletes, but you can restock on this as 
well. 
 
Your task of finding the uranium cube is made hard by three types of force fields, which block 
different sections of the asteroid. Each type can be deactivated for a different period of time by 
standing on their respective control pads. To make matters worse, creatures known as Phantoms know 
about your task and will home in on your location. The only thing that they do is disappear upon 
contact, draining your energy in the process. Like oxygen and fuel, energy can be restored by finding 
energy depots. 
 
Other hazards to be on the look out for include fire, spikes, and poisonous plants. If you make 
contact with any of these, the game is over. Once you have found all the uranium cubes and gathered 
them in one place, you have five minutes to reach the teleport and escape before the nuclear 
explosion blows up the asteroid. You can save and load games anytime during the game.

Pharaoh's Curse (5665) (c) 1983 Synapse Software Corporation / Synapse Software Corporation 
 
In the centuries since the sealing of the Pharaoh's Tomb, even the dim memories of the fabulous 
treasure contained in the pyramid, have become infrequent whispers on the lips of mad adventurers. 
 
For three thousand years, the tomb has been a mystery and deathtrap. It is rumored that the chambers 
contain dark and terrible dangers for those that would make the pharaoh's treasure their own. And 
even more ghastly, the pharaoh and the guardian mummy are said to walk the chambers for all eternity, 
destroying all trespassers in the tomb. 
 
You've heard it all before and lived to tell about it and this is a chance of a lifetime. You've 
spent months finding these ruins and finally you're here at the fabled tomb. Still... what if the 
legends are true? As you descend into the first chamber, you hear footsteps... 
 
Somewhere in the swirling sands of the Sahara stands an enigma. A secret tomb that has for 43 
centuries stood undisturbed... untouched... unknown and unentered. The ancient pharaoh who lies 
buried within the vast twisting underground chambers was the 16th and last of a vast dynasty. His 
treasure, the gold, the art, the jewel encrusted sacred scarabs, all lie with him in the untouched 
chambers of the crypt. Unimaginable wealth for any but an emperor has lured you here and now you must 
descend... 
 
Before his death, the pharaoh vowed that he himself and his hideous minions of the underworld must 
protect his treasure from all who dare defile his timeless tomb. 
 
And so you must slip past his sentries and deathtraps that riddle the passages and shafts of his 
monument, and steal the treasures before you perish. 
 
As an adventurer, you must explore the pyramid in search of these treasures, while on the lookout for 
both the mummy and the pharaoh, who will shoot at you if you are caught. You will be awarded an extra 
life for each treasure you get. There is also the winged avenger. This creature does not harm you, 
but if you are caught in his grasp, he will take you elsewhere in the pyramid. 
 
There are keys that can be collected, and can open locked doors so that you can visit new chambers in 
the pyramid. You lose keys when you get carried away by the winged avatar or lose one of your lives. 
There are three levels. The higher the level, there more treasures you have to get and there are also 
new chambers. Higher levels require a password, which is revealed after playing the previous level.

PHM Pegasus (5674) (c) 1987 Lucasfilm Games LLC / Electronic Arts, Inc. 
 
PHM Pegasus is a combination simulation and action game. You control a naval hydrofoil missile boat, 
and need to complete a variety of different missions. Some of the missions include destroying all 
enemy vessels in a given area, surveillance requiring you to identify the location of enemy ships 
(without sinking them!), or to escort a supply ship through hostile territory. As missions are 
successfully completed you earn points based on how successful the mission was, and with increasing 
points you can advance in rank, from deck mopper up to admiral. Your performance on one mission won't 
have an affect on future ones, and you can choose to play missions out of order as well.  Several 
missions include other craft you can control to help out (both ships and helicopters). A time 
compression mode is included, which can be used to reduce the amount of time waiting to arrive at a 
destination, or even left on to make the action sequences more challenging.

including something to scare anyone. To rescue the Galactic Emperor, you must negotiate all of these. 
 
The action is mostly one-dimensional blasting, but with distinct sections of flying to a level, 
flying around it, and then navigating an underground cavern. A simultaneous 2-player mode exists to

These drawings are done using a cut-down variant of a paint package, which you can practice with to 
get your drawing skills up to scratch. You are not limited to freehand drawing - lines, boxes, 
circles and curves can be drawn, with variable ink colours and line thickness. After each question 
the game will tell you the answer and ask which player (if any) got the correct answer. Pictionary 
can be played against the computer, or with multiple players.

you must get to 10 points with a 2 point lead - if the scores reach 10-9 the game goes on until 
someone has a 2 point lead or reaches 15, in a similar manner to tennis. There are nine skill levels 
to beat, with increasing abilities as the game goes on. The human player has the advantage of serving 
first, and as the serve reverses every five points, you are guaranteed to have more chances to serve 
than your opponent (remember the significance of 10 and 15 in the scoring). The points system rewards 
long rallies and large winning margins, as you get points for each hit, for each point won, and for 
each point of the winning margin.

Pipe Dream (5715) (c) 1990 Assembly Line, The / Empire Software 
 
Each level of this abstract puzzler challenges the player to set up a network of pipes to allow an 
unspecified substance known as 'flooz' to flow through as many of those as possible. The pieces are 
offered in random order, and there are seven different types - straight lines going horizontally or 
vertically, corners rotating in each of the four directions, and cross-over pieces which carry the 
flooz straight across horizontally and vertically. Each of these can be entered from either side. 
When the flooz hits a gap, or a piece which the previous piece can't flow into, the pipe is finished. 
 
Before the flooz starts flowing from its randomly-selected starting position, the player has several 
seconds to start placing pieces. They can be put down anywhere. However a situation that can often 
occur is there will be a long and complex piping arrangement set up, yet a gap somewhere remains to 
be filled. Players are able to  replace a piece with another in the same square (to make it easier to 
flow the flooz that way), but for a slight scoring penalty. 
 
Bonuses are awarded for looping the flooz through both sides of at least 5 cross-over pieces, or 
passing the flooz through every square on the screen. Later levels have some squares on the grid 
blocked off, a few gaps in the side-wall (allowing flooz to thread to the other side of the screen). 
After every four levels there is a bonus game for points, in which the player can only place the 
pieces in the lowest open space in each column, similarly to the board game of "Connect 4".

Your spaceship will approach a pit. After it lands, your job is to collect the diamonds and gems in 
the pit before the tank completely blows away the terrain separating it and the spaceship. Once you 
have collected all the gems and diamonds, you need to make your way back to the spaceship. Sounds 
easy? Think again. Upon entering the pit, you will cause a rock to fall down and block the easy way 
out. The only way out is through the monster's lair. (A red line will separate you and the monster, 
and this line shortens in length as you walk further.) Last but not least, if the terrain is blown 
away, the spaceship will leave without you. 
 
The tank will also release soldiers that have one mission: seek and destroy you. However, you are 
equipped with a gun, and you use it to blow them away when they get in your way.

Platoon (5760) (c) 1987 Ocean Software Ltd. / Ocean Software Ltd. 
 
The film Platoon featured a squad of five soldiers on their mission for the US Army in Vietnam. In 
this action game based around the film, you take control of these five guys in turn, with the chance 
to switch between them as they each take one of the 3 hits that would kill them. 
 
The game recreates each of the sections of the film, starting with a side-scrolling journey through 
the jungle, with paths to cross both horizontally and vertically, and the ability to jump or duck 
hazards. You will need to blow up a bridge and then locate a village, which contains a torch, a map 
and a trap-door. The enemy has booby-trapped the area and are launching airstrikes, so the danger is 
not all from enemy ground soldiers. 
 
The next section is in first-person 3D, as you move through a network of tunnels in search of flares 
and a compass. There are 3 distinct control methods, changing from the standard motion when an enemy 
appears (this puts you in control of a cross-hair for more accurate targeting), and when you enter a 
room to search. 
 
After escaping this you settle in a bunker overnight, and have a limited amount of flares with which 
to locate incoming enemy, and must then shoot them before they can shoot you. The jungle airstrike 
from the film is the next moment - you have two minutes to rush into a safe position to the north, 
using your compass for guidance. 
 
Finally you face the treacherous Sergeant Barnes, and must hit him with grenades 5 times whilst 
trapped in a foxhole to prevent him wiping you out.

POD - Proof of Destruction (5784) (c) 1987 Mr Chip Software / Mastertronic Ltd. 
 
Gridrunner provides the gameplay for this top-view budget shooter with 25 levels, challenging you to 
survive until the time runs out.You start with three lives, but get an extra one (up to a maximum of 
five) when a level is completed. The time goal is not reset when you lose a life. 
 
You guide a small spacecraft around a screen representing your people's power grid, moving it in the 
four compass directions along the grid lines. Aliens fire in all directions, so there are no 'safe 
spots' in which you will not get hit. Their shots cut lines out of the grid, preventing motion along 
that space for the few seconds it takes to reform. Every fourth level deviates from the norm by 
simply forcing you to shoot aliens for bonus points. Lives can still be lost during and gained after 
these.

Pole Position (5803) (c) 1983 Namco Limited / Atarisoft 
 
Pole Position is the conversion of the arcade racing game. Enter the Grand Prix, race against other 
racing cars to achieve the highest score possible in the shortest amount of time. 
 
Before the player can enter the Grand Prix, the player must first qualify by competing in the 
Qualifying Lap within 73 seconds or less. If the player however, does not qualify in the Qualifying 
Lap, the player may continue to race until the Race Timer runs after 90 seconds. The player will 
score 50 point per 5 meters and additionally 50 points for every racing car passed. When the time 
runs out - Game Over. The player will have to restart the Qualifying Lap. 
 
Qualifying will enable the player to start in one of the eight available positions. The faster the 
lap time was, the better the starting position in addition to bonus score points. The number one 
starting position, is the Pole Position. 
 
During the Grand Prix, the player will compete against the Race Timer as well as against other racing 
cars. If the player fails to beat the Race Timer in any lap, the player drops out of the race - Game 
Over. Completing the race by reaching finishing line will grant the player 200 points per each second 
left on the Race Timer, bonus score for distance covered, and passing bonus points. 
 
Scoring 
 
1. Every 5 meters driven: 50 points 
Passing Car Bonus: 50 points per racing car 
Time Bonus: 200 points per second left on the Race Timer

Pooyan (5827) (c) 1983 Konami Industry Co. Ltd. / Datasoft, Inc. 
 
In this remake of the arcade game Pooyan from the early '80s, you play the role of a pig, protecting 
its piglets from wolves. 
 
The first screen takes place near the pigs' home.  Mrs. Pig rides up and down in a cable car, 
shooting at wolves, who are riding balloons downward, towards the ground.  If the wolves land safely 
on the ground, then they can climb a ladder, near the cable-car, and catch Mrs. Pig.  But if she 
shoots their balloons, they splat on the ground instead. 
 
The wolves shoot acorns at the pig.  But Mrs. Pig has a food based weapon too.  If she gets to the 
top, she can get meat, to toss at the wolves and make them jump off their balloons in pursuit.  Each 
wolf taken out this way is worth bonus points (on a doubling scheme: 400, 800 1600...) 
 
The second scene takes place at the wolves lair.  Here the wolves have reinforced balloons--it takes 
multiple hits to make them fall.  Here they float upwards toward a big rock, which they push on top 
of Mrs. Pig, when seven wolves are present.  Additionally, an alpha wolf (wolf leader) appears and 
summons wolves in packs.

Popeye is a conversion of the arcade action/platform game. As Popeye, you are trying to win Olive 
Oyl's love! She is at the top of the screen dropping tokens of her love, and you need to collect them 
before they hit the ground. After you have collected the required number of items, you can move on to 
the next, more difficult level. There are many obstacles trying to stop you from completing your 
task, though! Brutus wanders around the screen and is constantly trying to catch you. If you collect 
a can of spinach, you can temporarily knock him out, otherwise Brutus will knock you out. Other 
objects such as bottles or birds are also flying around the screen and will cause you to lose one of 
your lives if you are hit. Each level features a different layout of platforms and ladders, and will 
have you collecting different items as they float towards the bottom of the screen!

Popeye II (5831) (c) 1991 Bizarre Developments / Alternative Software Ltd. 
 
Strange happenings are afoot once again in Sweethaven and only Popeye can make it right. In Popeye 2, 
our spinach lovin' hero must once again rescue Olive Oyl and make mincemeat of Bluto while looking 
after Swee'Pea, feeding Wimpy and keeping an eye on Jeep. 
 
Popeye has four different levels to traverse through. His initial adventure takes him to a 
construction site where bouncing springs, falling girders and open welding flames impede his 
progress. Rolling barrels, and bombs which must be touched to be put out also stand to cause harm. In 
every level scattered hamburgers must be collected in order for Popeye to get past Wimpy who is often 
hanging out somewhere near the top of every vertically scrolling platform level. There are also feats 
of strength that Popeye must perform by beating up a punching robot-type thing with the aid of 
Spinach. Once past all these obstacles Popeye can move on to the next level. 
 
The second level takes Popeye into the urban jungle where he must climb the side of the Biff Spinach 
building and avoid the same obstacles as in the previous levels. In the third level falling girders 
are replaced with giant bananas as Popeye finds himself in a jungle. Coconut throwing monkeys hang 
from ledges and snoozing tigers and snakes decorate the trees. The fourth and final level of the game 
finds Popeye climbing the masts of the S.S. Trev and the S.S. Andy as he makes his way to a final 
confrontation with Bluto and rescue Olive Oyl. 
 
Popeye is able to jump around and occasionally when the situation calls for it punch his way through 
this vertical platformer. Bonus points are rewarded for finding Swee'Pea and Jeep. He can take 
multiple hits before he takes a curtain call but thankfully is unharmed by long drops. The player 
should beware as Popeye has only one life to get through the four levels of this adventure.

Portal is a computer novel. 
 
Where are all the humans? Upon returning from your 100 year voyage in the milky way, you find earth 
empty and abandoned. Between the decaying remnants of civilization, you discover a terminal for 
Worldnet, the global network that recorded all human activities. The answer must lie deep in its 
database. Anxious, you log on. 
 
Portal is a unique attempt of creating and adapting a novel specifically for the computer. The story 
of the boy Peter Devore, his incredible discovery and the mysterious portal are told by an AI named 
Homer, who reconstructs it piece by piece out of database fragments. As the plot develops, you 
acquire accompanying information by accessing eleven additional databases - for example a historical 
archive, military files or social backgrounds. As you switch between the databases to uncover new 
details, an extensive sci-fi story unfolds.

monitored on screen. Use them wisely, as hostile aliens and mines line the route. Get shot down and 
you re-emerge with a jet pack, now directed to the bay which can give you a new craft. 
 
The force-field gates near the power planets are guarded by turrets which must be shot down. The 
mission then boils down the insides of the plant, which must be destroyed before its tractor beam has

Powerplay - The Game of the Gods (5862) (c) 1986 Arcana Software Limited / Arcana Software Limited 
 
As one of the four great Gods Apollo, Hermes, Hecate and Aphrodite, choose a team of four mighty 
warriors to fight for you in the Powerplay tournament to prove who is the greatest. This battle will 
be fought out not using swords or knives, but with knowledge - gameplay takes the form of a complex 
quiz on a chess-like board. 
 
You have four playing pieces, which start off arranged as a cross in one corner of the 
isometrically-viewed board. The squares are split into four different colours, which each represent a 
particular broad Trivial Pursuit-style subject area. The question has four possible answers, and a 
correct answer allows you to move your piece one space, perhaps onto one of the four white teleport 
squares (which randomly places it on one of those four squares). 
 
When a piece lands on the same square as an opposition piece, a challenge ensues, which plays out 
like a quiz show, with questions asks in quick fire and the first player to answer gaining a point if 
right and losing one if wrong. The losing piece drops down a skill level. 
 
Once a piece reaches 25 Wisdom Points, it can mutate up a skill level - this makes it harder to beat, 
but makes the questions it faces harder.

PP Digger (5867) (c) 1993 Markt & Technik / 64'er 
 
This is a Boulder Dash clone, where players has to collect a number of diamonds before time runs out. 
Boulders (or “rockstones”, as the game describes them) scattered throughout each room can be used to 
the player's advantage. Removing the earth in which boulders rest cause these boulders to fall down 
until they hit the next piece of earth, creating a path in which the player can navigate to other 
areas by. Also, boulders can be used to crush any pumpkins and ghosts that are nearby. 
 
Other obstacles include changers and destructible walls. Changers create diamonds if boulders are 
placed on top of them, and destructible walls need to be destroyed in order to access passages that 
were previously sealed. Once players collect the last required diamond, they can proceed to the next 
room where more diamonds await them.

PP Hammer (5868) (c) 1991 Traveling Bits Production / Demonware Softwarehaus GmbH 
 
In this platform game featuring over 2500 screens, our hero is in search of hidden treasures across 
worlds such as caves and castles, and must collect it all to advance onto the next level. The twist, 
as you may guess from the title, is that his weapon is a hammer which can be used to burrow into the 
ground. The blocks quickly reappear though, which can be fatal if they trap him, but can also be used 
by the cunning player to trap an enemy. 
 
Not all the platforms and transporters on the levels are visible, which guarantees an element of Rick 
Dangerous-style trial and error. You have six lives, which isn't much considering that failing to 
complete a level within the time limit costs a life, and contact with enemies is costly (you can't 
drill through them Worms-style)

Predator is a side-scrolling platformer which uses the imagery and characters from the classic Arnie 
movie of the same name. The game is not a faithfully conversion of the movie however - your unit has 
already been killed off when the game starts and you will battle scorpions, enemy soldiers and dodge 
obstacles etc, before facing the Predator itself a number of times. 
 
The game is a fairly standard run-jump-shoot platformer, except that you start with no weapons at all 
and must collect them as the game goes on.

The game is a crosshair shooter influenced by Operation Wolf. The viewpoint is from slightly behind 
Harrington, while the game scrolls on as you clear each section. Mouse control is offered on 16-bit 
versions. Your armour must be kept functional by collecting top-ups, and there are weapon power-ups 
such as machine guns and rocket launchers to be had. You can't go in all-guns-blazing however, as 
killing a single innocent causes Harrington to lose his job

President Elect:1988 Edition is an updated version of the original President Elect adding the 
campaign data for the upcoming (at the time) 1988 election. The game is a comprehensive computer 
simulation of a presidential campaign from Labor Day to election night. The game can be played by 3 
players each assuming the role of campaign manager/candidate. The game proceeds through 9 weekly 
turns where the player decides how and where to concentrate their campaign efforts. Weekly polls are 
provided to give the players an idea on how they are doing. On election night the returns come in on 
a minute to minute basis until a winner is determined. The election night may be simulated in real 
time (2-6 hours) or the votes may be counted in 15 seconds. President Elect has seven historical 
scenarios (from 1960 to 1988) or a virtually unlimited number of hypothetical or ahistorical

GameTek's home version of the classic game show The Price is Right. Bob Barker and the Beauties are 
not present, but a multitude of pricing games from the show, as well as the wheel and the showcase, 
have been faithfully replicated. 
 
Four (or a maximum of eight, counting both rounds - the programme suggests switching players) 
contestants can play, with the computer filling in for the rest. Whether bidding on Contestant's Row 
or playing a pricing game, contestants will attempt to closely guess the price of an item provided. 
All items in the game are often-unintentionally-humorous misspellings of recognizable brand names, to 
avoid trademark infringement. 
 
Pricing games include the Mountain Climbing (in which your 3 guesses must be less than $300 away in 
total, otherwise a goat will push you over the edge), Safe Cracking (in which you have 3 
possibilities for each part of the price, and must correctly guess it) and the Dice Game (in which 
you accept or reject random rolls to get the real price). 
 
There is a persistent Hall of Fame with winners and their scores, and a parser for guessing/bidding 
prices. Players have to type in their price guesses, and answer to the math of how "off" they were, 
as they would if they were on the show.

him before the on-screen timer goes empty and he shoots you first. You can hide until the timer 
restarts but this is limited too. 
At the end of each stage is a bonus round where you have to shoot gangsters in a room, with no more 
ability to hide and a faster timer. 
As you progress through each stage, the game will become faster, and enemies will become harder to 
find and to hit. 
Of course, your goal is to reach the end of the game with the highest possible score.

Powerboat Simulator (5861) (c) 1989 Optimus Software Ltd / Codemasters Software Company Limited, The 
 
If this 'simulator' is to be believed, powerboat racing is a chaotic race across a number of largely 
one-directional tracks with fjords and inlets forcing you down one of two lanes, and sections where a 
bridge needs to be cleared by hitting a ramp at the right speed beforehand (as you jump over these, 
you can land so as to skim off other boats). Your boat is fitted with bombs, which can be placed so 
as to force the other boats to run over them, gaining you points. Extra bombs and fuel litter the 
course, often close to the banks, which you must avoid contact with, for fear of crashing your boat. 
When this happens you are forced into the next one, which is, as if by magic, available at a 
convenient point just beforehand. A helicopter flies overhead, dropping bombs which you must avoid, 
and often obscuring your view. The other boats often crowd together attempting to force you into the 
wall. 
 
As with all the Codemasters budget titles, realism goes out of the window, with an emphasis on simple 
instantaneous action.

The Psycastrians have attacked. Using their mind control abilities, they have taken over many world 
leaders, causing untold war and devastation. Now it is up to you to strike back. Take your fighter 
across 16 bases, on land, on sea, on the moon, and in space. 
 
Psycastria is a side-scrolling shooter. Go across each base, destroy the 10 energy pods that power 
the Psycastrian war machine while avoiding buildings and engaging alien spacecraft, then go to the 
next base. Unusually for a shooter, you can turn around at any time to go after any missed targets. 
Between bases, there is a bonus level that tests your timing at destroying aliens.

Psycho - Arcade Quest (5996) (c) 1988 Starsoft Development Laboratories, Inc. / Box Office, Inc. 
 
Psycho is a graphic adventure game with a key-based verb interface. 
 
A set of jewels has been stolen. At the time of the theft, a curator was with the jewels, so he got 
stolen, too. And who's the suspect? Norman Bates, of course. The next night, a daring detective 
drives out to the sinister Bates Motel. His plan: a) find the jewels, b) free the curator and c) take 
a nice hot shower, should time suffice. 
 
Psycho is entirely controlled with the keyboard: direction keys for moving your character around, 
shortcut keys for performing actions. You need to stand close to an interesting object in order to 
examine it. Adversaries will appear at random throughout the house, putting you to sleep by touch and 
thus draining your precious time -- you've only got four hours to solve the case. You may shoot the 
enemies as soon as you find a weapon. As there is no other option for character interaction, this is 
how you'll deal with the Bates family as well.

Items can be picked up along the way that will help you defeat opponents. One of them is a knapsack

Psycho Soldier (5999) (c) 1988 SNK Corporation / Imagine Software 
 
Sequel to Athena, the 2d side-scroller which starred a "kawaii" version of the greek goddess Athena 
as she set out to find adventure in the mortal world. 
 
Changing her bikini for a Japanese schoolgirl uniform, Athena uses her new psychic powers (hence 
"psycho" soldier... erm... yep, anyway...) to clear a post-apocalyptic world of its mutant 
inhabitants with the help of her friend Kensu (thus allowing simultaneous 2 player gameplay). 
 
Gameplay consists of the usual run 'n jump fare typical of the genre with the added feature of a 
constantly scrolling background, which added to the many "option"-style power-ups and Athena's own 
psychic blasts make the game a strange shooter/platformer hybrid.

180 is a darts simulation game and it follows the traditional darts rules where you compete against 
an opponent to see who scores the 501 points first on a best out of three sets. 
 
If you play against the computer in a Championship knockout competition the computer will randomly 
select the players out of eight different opponents. Each player has his own characteristics and 
style of play as their 'favorite doubles' they like to throw. 
Regardless against whom you play they will become better as you progress towards the final. 
 
A practice mode helps you to become familiar and more skillful at throwing the darts. 
 
The game can be played by one or two players.

Puffy's Saga (6010) (c) 1990 Ubi Soft Entertainment Software / Ubi Soft Entertainment Software 
 
Puffy and his fortuitously-named girlfriend Puffyn are trapped in an alien world full of threats, 
traps and surprises. Taking control of one or the other (Puffy is more powerful but Puffyn can move 
faster) you must find your way through. 
 
Puffy's Saga is an overhead view maze game that represents a cutesy variant of Gauntlet. Each of the 
20 levels has a quota of dots to eat before the level is completed. These levels are inhabited by 
foes who surround you and reduce your energy on contact. Meat restores 100 energy points each time - 
this total can go beyond its starting level of 500. You are armed with a gun, which not only kills 
foes but also turns many of them into edible energy-giving snacks. 
 
Keys must be collected and used to open doors. Magic Goms allow you to use a map or a fire-bolt. 
Other available bonuses include invincibility periods and teleporting.

Who needs weaponry when you're trying to save the earth from the invasion of the beings of Cirrus 
Major? Hopefully you don't, because the method of fending off the attack across the 108 zones of the 
game is rather more unusual. 
 
The Earth of the 22nd century has massive solar platforms for receiving energy direct from the sun, 
and these produce massive pulses of energy discharge. The idea is that you fly into these and direct 
them at angles so as to hit and destroy the Cirran invaders. The more pulses you have touched before 
unleashing a shot, the more powerful it will be, but you must be careful not to cause your ship to 
overheat.

crossed via moving platforms. You'll sometimes have the chance to catch a sausage flying around in 
the air as you move along.

increasingly stronger as the game progresses. Vehicles, helicopters and occasional traps (such as 
spikes shooting out of the ground) cannot be destroyed and must be avoided. Several extra weapons can 
be picked up, including: a double-barrelled shotgun, a machine gun, a flamethrower and a rocket 
launcher. While the shotgun replaces the standard weapon, all other weapons have limited ammunition, 
indicated by a bar at the bottom of the screen. At the end of each level, a boss-fight awaits the

Puzzle Panic (6036) (c) 1984 Epyx, Inc. / Epyx, Inc. 
 
Puzzle Panic consists of a series of small pattern-based puzzles, through which you guide Benny (a 
light-bulb) to the correct answers. Each level can be played individually, or in sequence as part of 
a larger puzzle, where each level is signified by a unique symbol, that users must discover to 
complete the final puzzle. 
 
Some puzzles are timed challenges, such as "Color Climb", where Benny must climb a series of coloured 
steps, with clues to the correct colour provided at the top of the screen. 
 
Others are pattern based, such as "Triangles First", where Benny must touch all triangles on the 
screen, followed by squares, then pentagons, etc. In these levels, Benny must also avoid being 
captured by a Devil-shaped enemy who is chasing him. 
 
Every level requires the player to recognise some form of shape, colour, number and/or spatial 
pattern. 
 
Completing each level reveals a series of gates containing different symbols, and passage through 
these gates will help Benny discover the relationship between the symbols and the levels. In the 
final level, the "metasequence", Benny must correctly identify the symbol representing each level, 
and select them in the order that they were played.

Puzznic (6041) (c) 1990 Taito Corporation / Ocean Software Ltd. 
 
The challenge in each level of Puzznic is to maneuvre a selection of blocks into place so as to clear 
them all, by making them make contact with blocks of the same design. You control a cross-hair, which 
can move a block left or right, which can cause it to fall if there is no block under the space it 
would occupy. 
 
There are many complications in terms of solving the levels. Moving platforms meaning that you need 
to move a block at a particular time, or in particular order, to prevent them being blockaded. In 
some situations there are an odd number of a certain type of block - solving these requires 
positioning two of the blocks one space apart, such that a move will result in a piece making contact 
with 2 others, and immediately removing all 3. You will also encounter blocks positioned on platforms 
suspended in space and gaps in level arrangements meaning that a certain number of blocks must be in 
place to make a certain move possible (by forming a stack, for example) 
 
The game structure is slightly unusual, as after you complete each batch of four levels you get a 
choice of 2 sets of levels - you are progressing through an expanding matrix of levels, which means 
there are 2 sets on level 2, 3 on level 3, 4 on level 4, and so on. This means that there are a total 
of 220 screens in the game. Each screen is played against a time limit, and losing a level (either by 
running out of time, or by making a poor move and leaving an impossible position) loses one of your 3 
lives.

Wally Week has become trapped inside one of his own nightmares, and is in danger of failing to wake

can be used to bring your alarm clock to life. 
 
The world inside his head is large and varied, with escalators, lifts and locked doors used to 
navigate it. Only two objects can be carried at a time, but some must be used in tandem, and others 
only become active when you walk over them while carrying one or two items they require to become 
active. 
 
As this is a nightmare world, not everything is as it seems - everything is enlarged, and axes, 
punching hands and ghosts are all out to get you. Your energy is measured by a 'Snooze Energy' meter 
depicted by a glass of milk - once this drops to minimum, one of your 3 lives is lost.

Quasimodo (6092) (c) 1984 
 
A hunchback atop a wall, minding his own business, is advanced upon by a man in armour climbing up a 
ladder from below.  Where have I seen a game start this way before?  No matter -- though its theme 
and trappings are strangely reminiscent of certain licensed popular contemporary videogame 
properties, the gameplay soon goes off in a direction all its own.  This hunchback, for instance, can 
fight back -- grabbing a rock from a nearby pile he handily hurls it down at the intruder, knocking 
him off his ladder.  But another is set up, and another... soon Quasimodo is singlehandedly fending 
off a veritable siege, tossing rocks left, right, down and to the lower diagonals as squirming masses 
of bad guys return fire with arrows that bounce off the walls!  Yet as soon as it began... all is 
quiet once more, your sole companion an endlessly-flapping bat (who kills you should he 
absentmindedly drift into your path). 
 
The game shifts gears here, the joystick's action button switching duties from rock-lobbing to 
jumping.  No other humans will be seen for quite some time as you scurry up ladders and swing 
yourself across ropes dangling from massive ceiling-mounted bells, all in pursuit of gleaming gems to 
deposit in basement altars.  Every time you do so another area of the game will be opened up, and you 
get to undertake the grand circuit once more -- again fending off the ladder-climbers, swinging 
across the same pits (the only time you enjoy bat-immunity, though they don't make any conscious 
effort to seek out your close company), dodging the same bats (the flock increased by an extra bat 
each time through).  At the very pinnacle of your medieval structure you will have to climb a sheer 
wall face while dodging (and returning) arrows shot by archers in the window and (now the tables are 
turned!) boulders rolled down from the parapets.  (Parapets?  This, then, is no Notre-Dame!)  And 
then the gem is got, and back down again, and so forth and so on

Quest for the Holy Grail, The (6106) (c) 1985 
 
The Quest for the Holy Grail falls into the genre of a text adventure game but in addition to the 
text there are simple pictures which help add to the descriptions of the locations you are in and add 
to the atmosphere as you move around the game world. 
 
You take on the role of the knight Sir Tappin, who is on a mission to track down the Holy Grail. You 
must navigate your way around the villages and countryside of medieval England to track down the 
clues that will help you on your quest. You will need to find objects to help you negotiate your way 
past the characters dotted along the way, such as the White Rabbit and the Knight Who Says Nic. The 
Quest for the Holy Grail is a trip through a possible version of history, with a liberal sprinkling 
of humour thrown in too.

Questron (6122) (c) 1984 Strategic Simulations, Inc. / Strategic Simulations, Inc. 
 
In this adventure game, the player begins as a peasant whose land is under attack by monsters.  After 
killing one, a princess names  the peasant champion, and issues a quest, to rid the country of 
enemies.  She can provide no map, but says that part of the quest involves learning the layout of the 
land by traveling it...and so the game begins. 
 
The ultimate objective is to find and defeat the wizard Mantor, and recover a magic book which gives 
him the ability to flood the land with monsters. 
 
The game is played on a two-dimensional scrolling map.  Everything is represented by a sprite: towns, 
monsters, trees, hills.  The sprite which represents the player changes, depending on which mode of 
transportation is used -- beginning, for instance, on foot.  Dungeons in the endgame are done in a 
three dimensional style similar to The Bard's Tale. 
 
The player may be a rising hero, but even still heroes need money with which to buy tools and weapons 
and even food -- starvation is a real possibility!  One source of food and gold is hunting game 
animals -- some can be eaten, and many carry gold.  Then there are further opportunities in the 
various towns... 
 
The Questron hero does not have to be perfect

Questron II (6123) (c) 1988 Westwood Associates / SSI 
 
As the second title in the Questron series, this game follows the same basic formula as the original. 
You start out as a lowly peasant with only a few gold coins in your pocket and a bad attitude to 
defend yourself. By stumbling around the countryside and fighting hordes of creatures, you gain 
wealth, experience, and title. 
 
Questron II spans two continents, Landor and the Realm of Sorcerers. Additionally, there are the 
requisite tombs, castles, and dungeons. In the first Questron, your goal was to defeat the evil 
Wizard Mantor. Now, in Questron II, the good Wizard Mesron has sent you back in time before the Book 
of Magic was created. Your goal is to defeat the six Mad Sorcerers before they can create the book.

A dragon is terrorizing the kingdom of Balema, and King Galt send his champion, named Gorn, to solve 
the problem. The player takes the role of a nameless advisor, who has to help the strong, but not 
very intelligent Gorn to get rid of the dragon and save his homeland. 
 
The Quest was one of the first graphic adventures that incorporated full sentence parsing. Unlike 
most other adventures, the commands the player inputs do not refer to the playable character. Rather, 
as the playable character, the player gives those commands to Gorn. Instead of just entering short 
verb commands, the player is able to type relatively complex instructions, that have to be understood 
by Gorn in order to perform the necessary action.

Rabbit Pie (6146) (c) 1985 Illusion Software Ltd. / Illusion Software Ltd. 
 
One day, a proud owner of a vegetable garden was so sick of rabbits digging up the garden and eating 
their crops, that he finally decided to hire a hunter to take care of the rabbit. In this game, 
players control a rabbit that must navigate a maze tracking down her four babies without getting hit 
by the hunter's shots. The hunter moves around so that he can get a clear shot of the rabbit. 
 
Once the rabbit has collected her babies, she then makes her way through her burrow which is infested 
with creatures, to the vegetable garden where there is plenty of juicy carrots for her to munch on. 
She has a limited amount of time to do this, and to make matters worse, a bird flying overhead tries 
to bomb her with its dropping as it flies past her. However, if she drinks from some of the fountains 
around the garden, the bird will stop the droppings for a few seconds, allowing her to get more 
carrots without any trouble. Once she has eaten all the carrots, she is able to make her way back 
through her burrow and to try her luck again. 
 
She had better do a good job, because if she fails, one of the meals on the owner's menu will be 
rabbit pie.

Millions of people around the world joined the campaign to help children worldwide by fighting

Players take on the role of Omar Khalifa, the legendary Sudanese athlete who has decided to 
participate. Starting from the El Mowheli relief camp in Sudan, he has limited time to raise a flag 
and light a flame in each of the six continents. Khalifa's journey has him pass famous landmarks such 
as the Statue of Liberty, the United Nations, the Leaning Tower of Pisa, Mt. Rushmore, the Sydney 
Opera House, the Colosseum, and the Eiffel Tower. There are multiple routes on each continent. 
 
Khalifa can pick up objects to help him reach places, but only one object can be carried at a time. 
He can also get an hourglass which will give him more time. The run is over when Khalifa runs out of 
time or when he comes into contact with dangers he must face.

Racing Destruction Set (6154) (c) 1985 
 
An isometric racing game that sets itself apart by the large number of customizable options. 
 
The game comes with 50 built-in tracks, and the intuitive editor makes for infinite variety of races. 
Modify the existing ones or create one yourself. Set up sharp curves, crossovers, jumps (set the 
height), track width and more. Then set the track width and choose either ice, dirt or pavement for 
the surface. As if it weren't enough, gravity can also be modified, from a Moon-like low to a 
crushing Jupiter-like high that will keep your car glued to the ground, even after a jump. 
 
Once the track is laid out, race in either a beat up VW Beetle, a stock car, a dirt bike, a Porsche 
and even a Lunar Rover. Each car has it's own characteristics and you can also choose tires and 
engine sizes, according to the track you're about to race in. Also, equip your cars with land mines 
or oil slicks to make the race more interesting. 
 
The game allows single-player against a computer opponent, or a two-player race, both in split-screen 
form.

Radar Rat Race (6161) (c) 1982 Commodore Electronics Ltd. / Commodore Electronics Ltd. 
 
Radar Rat Race takes the gameplay of Rally X and puts it into a rodent context. You control a rat, 
who must grab all the pieces of cheese in a maze, and flee from all the other rats. Once you reach a 
barrier in the maze, you are automatically rotated, but you can always manually change direction. 
 
There are red ones who chase after you, and black ones who are activated when you get close to them - 
both types kill you on contact. When they are close, you can activate a Star Screen to block them 
off. 
 
The Radar of the title is on the right of the screen, and shows you where each piece of cheese is, 
although the actual maze is not illuminated, so your next snack might be further away than you think.

Rad Warrior (6159) (c) 1987 Palace Software, LTD. / Epyx, Inc. 
 
As Tal, your job is to single-handedly clear out the aliens who have invaded a desolate and destroyed 
post-nuclear earth. To have any chance of this, he must locate a sacred suit of armor. Not only will 
this protect him from radiation, and allow him to withstand some enemy contact, it also heals him, 
and enables him to float. 
 
This means that the game has two distinct styles, with your character limited to jumping, and with 
only rocks (located around the screens) to throw. Once he finds the suit he can fly around the 
ledges, shoot the inbuilt Pulsar beam, and survive within the volcanic hideout the aliens have based 
themselves. You will need to recharge the suit at times, and also take it off to pass through tight 
caverns.

Rags to Riches (6173) (c) 1985 
 
Rags to Riches may be called 'the only real bum simulator', in that it lets you live life as a bum 
trying not to starve on the streets of a modern city. 
You start your week with barely any money and nothing to eat, and then you'll try to work your way to 
the top by getting a job (and maybe, cutting your hair and beard to get a decent one), selling empty 
bottles and trying not too drink too much in the process. 
If you play your cards well, you might even end up on high street, where rich people live! 
But be careful, policemen do not like bums to wander around in rich streets and will do their best to 
hunt you down and put you in jail. Also, thieves have no respect for you what so ever, and will rob 
you of everything you own, even those few bucks you found lying in the gutter. 
It's a tough life.

Rainbow Dragon (6185) (c) 1988 Duck Software / Firebird Software Ltd. 
 
Players control the Rainbow Dragon who is desperately trying to get out of the cave system. To do 
this, they must destroy ten magic chests scattered around the cave system. These chests are blocked 
by a variety of obstacles which may be removed from magic. 
 
The screen is split into two halves. The top half shows the status panel, four pillars, and four 
icons. Each pillar represents the slowly decaying cave system, and if all four of them split in the 
middle, the game ends. Also present here is a glowing staff that can be activated by the space bar, 
allowing you to fix the pillars and give you more time to explore the caves further. 
 
The bottom half shows the dragon and its immediate surroundings. Crashing into the walls causes 
energy loss, so the player needs to carefully move the dragon around. If all of its energy is 
depleted, the dragon will slow down and the game will end. Some areas are blocked by laser fields, 
which are often turned off by moving a switch.

Using the power to cast rainbows, trapping anything underneath, the boys must ascend vertically 4 
levels each island, with a big, bad boss at the end of each. 
 
By trapping beasts under your rainbows, then jumping on them to break them you can collect seven 
different colored gems, and there are also power-ups for extra speed and rainbows.

Rainbow Walker (6188) (c) 1984 Synapse Software Corporation / Synapse Software Corporation 
 
This game is about a baby owl  tasked with coloring of the rainbow high above the clouds. The rainbow 
is organized as stripes of colors, which initially appear as different shades of gray. The stripes 
themselves are split into smaller squares. The owl navigates the playfield by jumping back, forward, 
left or right, one square at a time, coloring them in the process. 
 
Some squares are in fact gaping holes and jumping on those will send the owl tumbling down to his 
death. Trying to stop him from accomplishing the noble task are weird looking imps, birds and other 
critters that seem bent on devouring the little guy as they converge on him from all directions. The 
only way to escape the gruesome fate is clever avoidance. 
 
As the game progresses, not only does the shape of the rainbow become narrower and trickier, with 
more dead ends and pitfalls, but also the speed and number of the enemies increases. Every few stages 
a bonus round is offered, during which extra lives can be gained by quickly hopping on pieces of the 
rainbow appearing in random directions. 
 
The game is presented in pseudo-3D perspective and features cosmetic day and night changes.

Rainbow Warrior (6189) (c) 1989 Source the Software House Ltd. / MicroStyle 
 
Named after the Greenpeace ship that was sunk in the 1980's, this was an environmentally themed game. 
There were seven different campaigns, with each one featuring a different style of game inspired by 
actual Greenpeace actions. These included blocking pipes to stop the release of nuclear waste (while 
avoiding mutated wildlife), stopping waste from being dumped at sea, saving a whale and stopping acid 
rain. While the games were rather simplistic, it was interesting to see it at the time, released on 
the Microstyle label (set up by Microprose as "games for adults", aiming at a mature audience, after 
the acquisition of Telecomsoft).

Rallycross racing was once popular on the BBC, featuring super-modified cars racing against each 
other on tracks combining tarmac and gravel sections. Rally Cross Challenge sees Anco bring it to 
life in top-view Super Sprint style. 
 
There are six different circuits, and four cars in the game - 16-bit users with a Microdeal joystick 
adapter can have all four of these controlled by human players, other users are limited to 2-player. 
Computer cars have varying personalities and abilities. You must finish in the top 3 to move on to 
the next race. 
 
The opportunity to upgrade your car comes after each race, with the points you earn from race results 
(4,2,1 for the top 3). There are six categories of upgrades - turbo, steering, traction, 
aerodynamics, repair time and brakes.

Rally Driver (6194) (c) 1988 Five Ways Software / Alternative Software Ltd. 
 
Rather than creating a pure arcade game, Five Ways aimed at creating a true simulation of rallying 
that also had educational value. As such, a full map of the area is provided, a degree of 
route-planning is required, with each road having its own properties. Some have a higher possible 
speed, some are more likely to flood when it rains, and some are prone to being closed. 
 
You can get information on current conditions (and avoid a 50-second penalty) by stopping at a 
checkpoint. The hazards featured in the game are unusual - spectators running onto the track and 
stray farm animals must be avoided, and a definite penalty is imposed for driving the wrong way down 
a road. The race is in three stages, and drivers are eliminated after each of the first 2.

High Seas (3539) (c) 1987 
 
From the days of fighting sail comes this game of combat on the high seas. 
 
Although produced very early in the PC era (1988), Ralph Bosson's High Seas works from a graphical 
deck view, resorting to a chart view only for position checks (which can become important in fleet 
engagements). It operates either on 10-game-minute turns, or interrupt-to-issue-orders mode.  It 
models the effects of wind on maneuvering and the effects of different ammo types against the wooden 
walls and sails of opposing vessels.  A very advanced feature included is a scenario designer. 
 
The game can be played either hot-seated or with a computer opponent.

Rambo - First Blood Part II (6198) (c) 1986 Platinum Productions / Ocean Software Ltd. 
 
Tough Vietnam veteran John Rambo is called back into action after some soldiers are taken hostage in 
a PoW camp. His orders are to simply capture photographic evidence of the war crimes taking place, 
but after finding a close friend tied up, he decides to wipe them all out by himself. This being 
Hollywood, chances are that he will succeed. 
 
Ocean's interpretation of his challenge recreates Commando fairly closely. You move up the screen, 
taking out enemies – these respawn, so there is no value in not moving upwards as quickly as 
possible. Find strategic positions from which to attack. Touch each hostage you find to free them. 
 
You have knives and grenades, but using the latter alerts the enemy as to your presence, making life 
harder. Extra weapons such as rocket launchers and machine guns can be collected en route.

Rambo III - The Rescue (6199) (c) 1989 Ocean Software Ltd. / Taito America Corporation 
 
Rambo's mission is set deep in Afghanistan, in the days when the Soviets occupied it, and America was 
putting this right (we won't mention who they enlisted to do so). Colonel Trautman has been kidnapped 
by the Soviets, and you've gone in there to rescuing him. Doing so is a three-part operation 
approximately following the plot of the film. 
 
In the first part, you explore the building Trautman could be in, through a top-down view of the 
building. It is heavily protected by infra-red security beams, which when activated unleadsh the 
enemies. The locations of the beams are only apparent if you collect the special goggles. Other 
hazards include mines, trapdoors and booby-trapped doors, but there are enhanced weapons to collect. 
 
Section two is identical to the first, except that it is located outside, the enemy are onto you from 
the start, and there are no traps. The final section changes to an Operation Wolf-style shoot 'em up, 
with a horde of tanks, foot soldiers and helicopters to face. Your gun can jam, which adds to the 
challenge of finally getting out alive.

destroying buildings, and up to 3 human players can join in. 
 
Smashing at the edges of the buildings for long enough will make them collapse. The police and 
military are after you, and will shoot at you, so try to destroy them (failing that, you can avoid 
the bullets). You will need to eat regularly, with things like plants on offer, to avoid shrinking 
back to being human

conversion does as well, making it a faithful, entertaining classic for multiple players on the same

Ramparts (6203) (c) 1987 Future Concepts Ltd. / GO! 
 
Not to be confused with Atari Games' Rampart, Ramparts is in fact a clone of Bally Midways' Rampage, 
but with a medieval theme, and players are giant knights instead of monsters. The game is for one or 
two players simultaneously, and each has the opportunity to enter in a five-character name before 
play begins, which will subsequently be displayed next to individual scores during play. 
 
The game takes place on a single screen, where the player(s) can move left and right on one 
foreground plane, and the object is to destroy a castle, each phase, by scaling and punching the 
individual buildings until each, and all collapses. Buildings will often overlap, requiring some to 
be taken down before others. Players will be harassed by witches, goblins, archers and the like. 
 
The back story concerns two knights, Sir Griswold and Sir Larkin, who have had a curse set upon them 
to be transformed into giants by the Evil One, and they must quest for the fiend, so that they may be 
restored to mere mortals.

Ranarama (6207) (c) 1987 Graftgold Ltd. / Hewson Consultants Ltd. 
 
The purpose of apprentice courses is for young people to learn a trade gradually, without putting 
yourself or your employers at risk. Unfortunately, nobody explained this to Wizard’s apprentice 
Mervyn, before he tried to cast a spell to make him irresistible to females, as the spell misfired, 
and made him attractive only to female frogs. However, his dungeon was soon invaded, and Mervyn was 
not killed, as he appeared to be a humble frog. 
 
Viewed from above, the aim is to kill all 96 of the wizards who have invaded the dungeon, which is 
split into 8 levels, each made up of 16 screens and at least 50 rooms. To see what’s in a room he has 
to enter it, in a manner similar to the Switchblade games. 
 
The game’s rather esoteric title comes from the way you obtain spells to upgrade the four different 
types of power you have (power, offence, defence and effect). When you meet a warlock you enter a 
mini game in which the letters RANARAMA are in random order, and by swapping pairs of letters in 
sequence you must form the full word in as little time as possible. This system of having a sub-game 
for collecting upgrades is similar to the ‘grappling’ concept in Paradroid. 
 
This earns up to four of the Runes (Mysticism, Witchcraft, Magecraft and Runecraft), each of which 
can be used on one of the four types of power. The Magecraft offensive use is a fireball, defence for 
Runecraft makes you invisible to enemies, and the special effect for Witchcraft allows you to jump 
through space. Lose a life and you lose all these powers, and losing another life means it’s Game 
Over.

At the end of some levels, a plasma computer needs to be destroyed before the cop can proceed to the 
next level. This is done by shooting the rotating plasma vent where bolts are fired toward the cop.

Reach for the Stars - The Conquest of the Galaxy (6236) (c) 1983 SSG Strategic Studies Group Pty Ltd.

Reach for the Stars is the original "spaceploitation" game.  The player has the opportunity to name 
his civilization and those of his (up to three) AI opponents before he begins his attempt at galactic 
domination.  The game is very bare bones by modern standards: the 2D galaxy map is marked only by 
planets and their names in few different colors.  Also, there is no diplomacy and no player control 
over tactical combat. 
 
What remains is a hard-core game of grand strategic and economic production.  The player must tweak 
his planets, build ships, research new tech levels, and deploy fleets.  A nice feature of the game is 
that just about all of the underlying dynamics can be altered and customized by the player, which 
means that Reach for the Stars is infinitely replayable.

After the success of the Ghostbusters film (and indeed of the licensed game from Activision) a

This is done by first shooting the ghosts using a gun, and then by using a photon beam (by holding 
down the fire button) to suck them in for storage in the backpack. Photon recharges can be collected, 
as can the potential for an improved shot, as well as a shield. The Ghostbusters mascot Slimer also 
appears as a power-up, which hovers around your character killing ghosts on contact.

adventure with the party, stats, and combat system of an RPG. 
Assemble a party of one to eight characters and go on quests to gain power and riches and magical 
items by defeating monsters. The game consists of many scenarios, each requiring several hours of 
playing to be completed. Move around in the realms using your keyboard or joystick or both. Travel 
and explore cities, dungeons, caverns and other types of dwellings and even talk to city inhabitants. 
 
Creating characters requires that you determine their traits and abilities which are defined as six 
attributes: Wisdom, Intelligence, Agility, Strength, Vitality and Luck. Choose their profession or 
class. Your choices are Fighter, Sorcerer, Priest, Thief, Champion, Knight, Barbarian or Friar. 
Finally, decide what race they will be, Gnome, Dwarf, Elf or Human. Once that is done, choose the sex 
and type your characters name. Once you have assembled your party, your adventure can begin.

Rebel (6255) (c) 1987 Gang of Five / Virgin Games, Ltd. 
 
In the future, working conditions in agridustrial combine compounds are a step back to slavery, with 
no prospects, long hours and poor treatment. One day THX2240 (an obvious George Lucas reference) 
decides she's had enough, and steals a Crowd Control vehicle to escape. 
 
Escaping from the whole 10-level complex is a big task though, as each of the many compounds has its 
own locks. These can be removed using mirrors to guide a solar beam onto the locks, weakening them. 
There are patrol guards trying to stop you, and each time you fire a beam and it fails to open a 
door, you lose a life. The action is viewed from above with a pseudo-3D feel.

Rebel Charge at Chickamauga (9861) (c) 1987 
 
Rebel Charge at Chickamauga is a tactical simulation of the South's last major offensive thrust 
during the American Civil War. 
 
The game uses a refined version of SSI's Gettysburg game system and is played in 13 turns each 
representing two hours of real time over a two day period. Players are awarded points based on 
casualties and territorial objectives. At the end of each turn and the end of the game points are 
calculated and compared to a chart which determines your level of victory. The game can be played 
under 3 different sets of rules (Basic, Intermediate, and Advanced) and can be played against another 
person or the computer can play either side.

Rebel Planet (6257) (c) 1986 Adventuresoft UK Ltd. / U.S. Gold Ltd. 
 
You play the part of an agent of SAROS, the Terran resistance movement against their imperial alien 
overlords, the Arcadians. Disguised as a merchant, you will fly your ship, the Caydia, to three 
different colony planets -- Tropos, Halmuris, and Arcadion -- to rendezvous with underground freedom 
fighters and gather the intelligence you require to destroy the central computer of the Arcadian 
hivemind, liberating humanity! 
 
An adaptation of Robin Waterfield's Fighting Fantasy gamebook #18, published the previous year, this 
computer game version rejects the Choose-Your-Own-Adventure gameplay design of the book in favour of 
a more open-ended text adventure model, albeit one with a restrictive text parser.  Most elements of 
the trademark Fighting Fantasy RPG system, including the randomness of even simulated die-rolls, have 
been streamlined out, leaving only metrics for damage taken and hunger (hitherto untracked in the 
books.)  Carrying limits, while atypical in FF gamebooks, are enforced here as in the original book. 
 
A further new dynamic includes the strict timetable of the space traffic control towers -- you need 
to have wrapped up your business planetside before your launch window comes up, otherwise you're out 
of luck.  In keeping with the game's sci-fi setting (in both rural and urban flavours), you will find 
extensive use of objects such as your limcom, nutritious hcaps (tasty like dead Zorkons, num num!), 
and the indispensable lite-kube.  Combat has been largely phased out in favour of an extension of the 
gamebook's espionage theme of ciphers and passwords, magic words with the power of plot advancement. 
 
A version of this game also came out for the BBC Micro.

By shouting 'Kwah!' ordinary Kevin Oliver can transform himself into superhero Redhawk, a power you 
must use in this cartoon adventure. As you travel the city you must pay attention to your popularity 
ratings - you can play the game either to perform good or evil. 
 
The game uses a text parser with a vocabulary allowing for actions such as walking, looking around, 
arresting people, hitting them, using objects, or waiting in a set position for a set amount of time 
- every action sees time get used up. Standard input methods such as using AND or commas to delimit 
multiple commands, and leaving out words like THE and SOME are implemented. 
 
Being in Redhawk mode uses up energy, so this must be used sparingly.The screen display is in comic 
book style, with the last 3 drawings on screen at each time.

Red Heat (6273) (c) 1989 Special FX Software Ltd. / Ocean Software Ltd. 
 
Red Heat is based on the Walter Hill film of the same name, starring Arnold Schwarzenegger and James 
Belushi. You take control of Soviet detective Ivan Danko (played by Schwarzenegger), who travels to 
Chicago in pursuit of the fearsome Georgian drug lord Victor Rosta. 
 
The game is essentially a side-scrolling beat'em up in the vein of Vigilante. As Danko, you proceed 
across four levels which follow the movie's original setting, where you are constantly attacked by 
members of the Cleanheads, a group of drug-dealers who are in business with Victor Rosta. To 
eliminate hostiles you can either punch them (slow but long-ranged) or head-butt them (close-ranged 
but faster). The only defensive move available is crouching, so as to avoid being hit - there is no 
jumping or any other evasive tactics. Occasionally, you can get hold of a handgun and fire six shots 
at the villains. Other items you can pick up will boost your health, make you temporarily 
invulnerable or give you access to bonus levels. 
 
One peculiarity of Red Heat is its widescreen-like game area, and the fact that all characters are 
drawn from the waist up. This may find partial explanation in the first level, set in a Russian sauna 
where, as in the original movie scene, all characters are not wearing clothes.

The Red Moon Crystal is the only source of Magik in the land, and stabilizes the forces of the world. 
This crystal has been stolen and as a result, the land has fallen into chaos. A single powerful 
magician is sent to rescue the Crystal from the castle where it's hidden. 
 
Red Moon is an graphical interactive fiction game. Players assume the role of the wizard on his quest 
to recover the crystal. They will have the use of many weapons and a dozen magical spells. Combat is 
a key element of the game: both the magician and enemy opponents have hit points, in the style of 
RPGs. Spellcasting requires certain objects to be collected, and many spells must also be cast on a 
specific target. Various objects will be found during the adventure, including garlic, pills and a 
mask.

Red Storm Rising (6279) (c) 1988 MicroProse Software, Inc. / MicroProse Software, Inc. 
 
The Soviet Union, under severe pressure after destruction of one of their biggest oil refineries, 
must secure a new source of oil, and to do that, they must disable the West... which means they must 
invade Europe and fight NATO to a standstill... And the only way NATO can prevent that from happening 
is to reinforce their forces with convoys from the US and other countries. 
 
You are in command of one of the US attack submarines. You must hold the ocean against the Soviet 
navy at all costs, or the land battle will go badly. Part submarine simulator, part dynamic campaign, 
and part WW3 simulation, Red Storm Rising is an amazing look at modern warfare.

Reederei (15454) (c) 1990 Digital Artists / United Software Entertainment 
 
Reederei is a turn-based trading game where players can buy and sell goods to make profit. The game 
is totally menu driven and there are no action sequences. 
 
While playing, players try to run an Hamburg based maritime company. On each turn, each player has an 
option to send their ship to another seaport, buy goods from there and return to Hamburg where they 
can sell it for a good price. Players are also expected to buy ships to enhance their ship convoy 
thus increasing their buying quota from other seaports. 
 
The goal of the game is to increase company value to a certain score. This score depends on the game 
difficulty. First player reaches this score (either human or computer) wins the game.

kidnappers. This is split into five levels, taking you through the subway and the docks as well as 
some inhospitable streets. A wide range of aggressive moves are on offer, including headbutts, kicks, 
punches and flying kicks. Much of the game's violence is depicted in a fairly tongue-in-cheek style,

Renegade 3 was the third and last in the Imagine's series, based on the original coin-op by Taito. 
The hero's girlfriend has been beamed into the future, while the man himself has been sent back into 
prehistory. This sets the scene for a sideways scrolling arena combat game, where the player fights 
in various time periods. The settings varied from Egyptian and medieval, to a futuristic level. As 
such, gone are the attacks of street gangs from the first two iterations of the series, replaced by 
assailants such as knights in armor and robots. In each level you have six minutes to reach the 
finish, as this is all the time the time-travel portal is available for. There are many surface 
hazards to avoid, as well as multi-layered Green Beret-style areas. You can kick and punch at 
different heights, allowing you to deal with each of the diverse foes.

Fortunately you can steal back the energy they take, but you can't steal back parts of your base. The 
other six enemies just try to kill you. The bigger the enemy base gets, the more rapidly and 
accurately they can launch enemies at you.

Rescue on Fractalus is an action game played from a 3D first person point of view. Your mission is to 
rescue stranded pilots on the planet of Fractalus. You begin each mission from the mother ship, and 
when your quota of pilots has been rescued you must return there so you can move on to the next 
level. To help locate the pilots and navigate the tricky terrain, your spaceship is equipped with 
various instruments, such as a compass, altimeter, and scanner. Your enemy, the Jaggi's, have 
numerous forces on this planet and will be attempting to stop you. Gun emplacements, flying saucers, 
and the Jaggi themselves are all capable of destroying your ship if you don't destroy them first. To 
defend yourself from these threats, your ship is equipped with torpedoes. As the levels progress, the 
Jaggi defenses become more aggressive, and you will even need to fly some night missions where 
visibility is limited!

Rescue Squad (6313) (c) 1983 
 
This three-part game loosely simulates the work of an ambulance driver rescuing people from a fire. 
First, you are trying to get across the city, which is represented as a maze of houses, to where a 
building is on fire. Avoid contact with the houses or other vehicles. A timer counts down from 1000 
to zero, representing your score - zero means you're out of time. 
 
There is no fire truck at the building when you arrive, so you have to catch the people who are in 
the building from falling to their doom, while avoiding falling flower pots. When three flower pots 
have hit you, this round of the game ends and the fire truck arrives. The goal is therefore to build 
up as many points as possible by avoiding these pots. 
 
After the fire truck comes, you can enter the blazing building to scour for survivors. You have to 
rescue everyone in the building before the fires in the building burn you to death. This is done by 
touching them to lead them, then moving to a window, without being hit by the fireballs.

You are from the planet Choom in the Thwok solar system, which is under threat from a group of seven 
crazed dictators and their intergalactic war. Can you fight them all off in this fusion of 
side-scrolling shooting and top-view fighting? 
 
First you fly along the planet's surface and atmosphere, complete with jetpack, shooting out enemies 
as they fly around you, and avoiding contact with them. You'll have to find planetbusters to gain 
access to the bunkers which contain nerve centres. 
 
Unfortunately, they are no use until charged up at one of the game's many shops, which is where the 
strategy element comes in. Shot enemies release credits, which can be spent on 12 powerful 
upgradeable weapons if you have any spare. These weapons can be sold to raise funds for improved 
weapons and charging. 
 
Inside the bunker you must cope without these weapons, fighting your way down to the nerve centres. 
Fortunately, your Powerfist can be upgraded in the aforementioned shops. Before you can reach the 
next planet, you must kill a boss within a time limit. This takes place in a 3rd-person view, 
fortunately with a full compliment of weapons.

Return of the Mutant Camels (6321) (c) 1987 Llamasoft Ltd. / Mastertronic Ltd. 
 
Jeff Minter's third camel-themed game (after Attack and Revenge) is again a horizontally scrolling 
shoot 'em up, taking place over 100 levels. 6,000 years ago, mankind fought the forces of Zzyax, 
using mutated forms of common animals. Now, the Zzyaxians are back, and the 90-foot camels must 
defend a planet no longer accustomed to warfare. 
 
The Zzyaxian hordes consist of typical Minter zaniness. Postboxes and letters, Pacman ghosts and 
microchips are all out to get you. The game allows you to fire in any direction, by moving the 
joystick while holding down the fire button. Additionally, you can drop miniature versions of 
yourself, as bombs. 
 
After completing a level or losing a life, the player can move to a level adjacent to the current one 
within a 10x10 grid. You can also purchase improved shields, energy recharges, or improved weaponry 
such as bigger or 'smart' bullets.

Return to Eden (6324) (c) 1984 Level 9 Computing, Ltd. / Level 9 Computing, Ltd. 
 
The command robots of Snowball have found the colonisable planet Eden, and already set about 
colonising this lush verdant planet. Not easy though - native plants and animals have adapted and 
fought back at the threat to their territory. A walled area now encloses the city, which is crumbling 
around you. 
 
When Snowball 9 reaches the planet, Commander Kim Kimberley is filmed apparently committing a murder. 
As Kim, you must escape from the 'justice' of crazed robot droids. Snowball 9's landing is made 
dangerous due to the robots malfunctioning. 
 
Return to Eden is an interactive fiction game which sets you as Kim, and challenges you to enter and 
survive within the robot city. Strange and surreal outcomes about - what do you get when you plant a 
brick? The world includes a bank, a theme park, the Corridors of Power, and a Starbike. 
 
Unlike its predecessor, it features graphics, with over 200 illustrative pictures featured. adds the 
ability to type while the screen is updating. Vocabulary is simplified - a new IT command refers to 
the last-mentioned object, and clothing can be WEAR'ed without being GET'ted first.

Return to Oz (6325) (c) 1986 Kaos / U.S. Gold Ltd. 
 
Based on the overlooked but dark in tone 1985 Walt Disney movie Return To Oz which was a non-musical 
sequel to The Wizard Of Oz, this combined story elements from L. Frank Baum's novels Ozma Of Oz and 
The Marvelous Land Of Oz.  The game plot follows the movie pretty closely.  After returning to 
Kansas, no one believes Dorothy's story. When she can't sleep, Auntie Em seeks help from a doctor who 
wants to give her scary tests in an insane asylum. Dorothy escapes and finds herself back in the Land 
of Oz where she learns the Nome King has taken over and has destroyed the Emerald City and the Yellow 
Brick Road.  Your new companion is Billina the chicken who in Oz can talk.  You will meet a scarecrow 
named Jack Pumpkinhead, and a robot named Tik-Tok, among others.  Dorothy must stop the Nome King and 
the witch Mombi who wants Dorothy's head for her collection, and restore Princess Ozma to the throne. 
 
There is a command line at bottom of screen with the following options: Look, Talk, Search, Get, 
List, and Leave. List shows you all the items you are carrying and shows you a sub-menu to Drop or 
Use an item.  The top of the screen offers a text description of the graphics scene shown.  As the 
game is intended for kids, when you select a command that is allowed on a particular screen, the 
person or objects on screen will flash to show what can be done and where.  Hitting the space bar 
moves the cursor to the next available option available.

Revenge of the Mutant Camels (c) 1984 Llamasoft Ltd. / Llamasoft Ltd. 
 
This typically zany Jeff Minter  title sets you as a mutated camel, with an optional support one 
mimicking your moves elsewhere. The hordes of enemies to be taken on include falling umbrellas and 
drinks machines. Shot enemies release tokens ranging from points bonuses and energy recharges to 
control-reversers and poison. 
 
Speaking of controls, the game uses the same system as Llamatron, which means that you fire 
automatically in the direction you're moving, but pressing the fire button allows you to rotate the 
direction of fire while immobile. This allows enemies in different parts of the screen to be attacked 
from less precarious positions.

You play Rick Dangerous, an Indiana Jones type who's on a quest to find the lost Coolu Amazon tribe.  
However, his plane crashes in the middle of a bunch of crazed Coolus. Hopefully he's up to the 
challenge of escaping. If he is, he will find himself in the pyramid of Egypt with no easy way past 
leaders and their minions, and then engulfed in a web of traps in a Nazi base. 
 
Rick Dangerous is a platform game across over 100 screens, in which Rick has his gun in one hand, and 
dynamite sticks in another. You must take a methodical approach to clearing each screen, as there are 
traps in place which will need memorizing and preempting where possible. Use the dynamite wisely, for 
enemies you can't get into the purely-horizontal range of your gun.

Rick can climb ladders and crawl through tight spaces. He is equipped with a laser gun and six little 
bombs, but can also punch with some effect. The controls are very easy to understand: pressing 
fire+up shoots the gun, pressing fire+down places a bomb, pressing fire+bottom-left/bottom-right

An insectoid race travels the galaxy and colonizes uninhabited and long dead planets. Force shields 
were created to protect their planets from the constant attacks of the arachnoids. The force shield 
generators need regular recharging, a task for which a group of elite insectoid warriors was created. 
Riding their reptilian mounts (Runners) they patrol the colonies, recharging the generators and 
destroying any hostile lifeforms that  have penetrated the shield. 
 
Players have to guide one of these warriors through horizontally scrolling levels, shooting at 
hostile lifeforms and seeking out shield generators that need recharging. A radar at the top of the 
screen shows the players position, as well as the position and status of the shield generators. Green 
generators are stable, flashing generators are unstable and red generators need to be recharged. 
Enemy attacks deplete the warriors health and might knock him of his Runner. On foot, the warrior is 
much slower and can't walk very far (the levels stop scrolling), but it is necessary to dismount the 
Runner to be able to recharge the generators.

Rings of Zilfin (6359) (c) 1986 Strategic Simulations, Inc. / Strategic Simulations, Inc. 
 
Rings of Zilfin is an unusual, but relatively unknown early fantasy solo RPG by Ali N. Atabek, who 
went on to create the Magic Candle series. It was meant for beginners to computer RPGs, featuring no 
character creation, simple game play and movie-like cut scenes, concentrating more on atmosphere than 
on character stats. 
 
The background: Long ago, the Zilfins (mighty wizards) established an enchanted realm of peace and 
property in Batiniq. They created two rings of power which, worn together, made the wearer 
invincible. Unfortunately, the evil necromancer Lord Dragos has found one of these rings and has come 
to great power. The only hope to prevent him finding the second one is Reis, a young boy possessing 
some innate magical ability. In the introduction, Reis barely escapes Dragos' minions, and leaves his 
home village. 
 
After "character creation" (giving Reis an optional other name and selecting one of 10 difficulty 
levels, which affect your starting resources), you start your quest to find the Zilfins and their 
second ring and to develop your magical abilities on the way. 
 
The game features a huge world with over 100 villages and towns in four kingdoms. Each town has up to 
three buildings you can enter -- shops with items to buy and sell, inns to eat and drink and rest, 
amongst others --, and also people you can talk to (careful, some are shape shifters!), sometimes 
offering valuable information. There are also a few dungeons and some caves to explore, but most of 
the game is played in towns or travelling between them. 
 
When leaving a location, the game shows a map where you can select the direction off your next 
target. While travelling between locations, the game shows an interesting side scrolling view. You 
can set your walking speed, which influences your fatigue, and stop when you encounter pools or 
plants. Pools can be drunk from (may have positive or negative effects), and the plants can be 
gathered and eaten later. Some plants have special effects, there are "magic mushrooms" and some 
other healing and boosting plants. This plant system is one of the things that distinguishes this 
game. 
 
While travelling, you may also encounter Lord Dragos' minions, which results in some pseudo-real time 
combat. The monsters are often quite unusual, like Barvils (mutated bats), Basurs (flying skulls) or 
Zumagin (the death ray demon). Protected by different armors, you can attack with arrows or swords or 
by casting spells. The game makes a difference between ground-based and air-bourne monsters -- the 
latter cannot be attacked with swords, of course. 
 
The spell system is quite simple. There are three spell levels: Apprentice, Master and Grand Master, 
each one lets you know more and more powerful spells. Casting a spell always costs some fatigue, and 
you have to prepare the spell first. 
 
The game is highly non-linear and there are several approaches possible. For example, it is possible 
to make money by trading, buying cheap items in one town and selling them in another town -- which, 
in fact, is the only way to make money in the beginning. All commands are given by pressing keys, 
like "G" for getting things or "C" for casting spells. The game may be saved when exiting towns and 
loaded at the main menu.

riverbanks or with the enemy aircraft destroys your plane and makes you lose a life.

Your vehicle is equipped with a machine gun to help you out, and occasionally a weapons plane will 
fly in and drop additional power ups that can be collected. Some of these are the U.Z. canon, cruise 
missiles, and speed boost. Your car has a very limited amount of fuel, however more can be picked up 
along the way by crossing the halfway point of a level, or by collecting the red and green fuel 
spheres that appear in the road or after destroying certain enemies.  On many levels collecting fuel 
is critical otherwise you won't be able to reach the finish line.

avoiding traps. You'll find ammunition, food, and hopefully the pass to the Arena.

You can get points for eating birdseed and making Wile E. get hit by trucks, falling rocks, etc. 
 
The Amstrad CPC, Commodore 64 and ZX Spectrum versions are one player only. The Atari 2600 version is 
one or two player, alternating. The Atari 2600 version also has another difference in that you don't 
HAVE to eat the birdseed but you can for the points. This may have been due to programming 
constraints on the Atari 2600.

Road Runner and Wile E. Coyote (6391) (c) 1991 PAL Developments / Hi-Tec Software Ltd. 
 
The cartoons of Road Runner trying to flee Wile E. Coyote (and inevitably cause him to fall into a 
trap) are recreated in this action game. You control Road Runner himself in two distinct stages, each 
of which are repeated four times with increasing difficulty. 
 
In the first Road Runner must peck as much seed from the ground of a single screen as he can, while 
avoiding the myriad traps and dangers Wile E. Coyote throws at him from the sky. The more seed you 
can peck, the better your chances will be in take 2.  This involves running away from Wile E, jumping 
the traps he has laid and finally reaching the safety of a big drop, which you will clear and watch 
Wile E. fall through, just like the cartoons.

Roadwars (6400) (c) 1988 Arcadia Systems, Inc. / Melbourne House 
 
In Road Wars you are set charging up a long hilly road, trying to make a road safe after a protection 
malfunction. Crucially, this involves shooting out the barriers at the side of the road (and avoiding 
falling into the gaps they create). You always play against another droid, who can be treated as 
friend or foe - pushing them into the gap at the side you've just created is a particularly neat 
trick, especially when playing a human opponent. 
 
You are armed with a laser gun, which can be directed seperately from your main direction of motion. 
The roads include a range of hazards, including barriers and spikes, although bonus weaponry and a 
speed-up can be gained. Contact with these (or your opponent) will gradually drain your shields, and 
once these are gone you have little chance of surviving for long.

international sides. These matches can be anywhere between 40 and 60 overs per side in length. 
 
First you select your team off 11 based on their battling, bowling and wicket-keeping abilities. A 
coin toss decides who bats first, after which you choose your tactics for the upcoming over, based on 
weather and wicket conditions. The bowling side has 9 field layouts to choose from. 
 
The action is represented from a top-down view of the whole field, with a running commentary as to 
the results of each stroke, showing what type of shot was played, who fielded the ball, and how many 
runs were scored.

Patrolman Alex Murphy was killed on the streets of Detroit. The major corporation there, Omni 
Consumer Products (OCP) saw an opportunity to sell a new kind of law enforcement officer to the 
troubled city. They took what was left of Murphy, encased it in titanium armor, wiped his memory and 
created RoboCop. Now it's up to RoboCop to clean the streets of Detroit and eliminate the one 
responsible for his murder, Clarence Boddicker. But it looks like Clarence might not be the kingpin 
of this town... 
 
Based on the 1987 movie of the same name, RoboCop allows the player to control RoboCop. The majority 
of the game is a side scroller. RoboCop can punch unarmed citizens and shoot armed citizens. He can 
move left, right and duck but can not jump. Different weapons can be picked up from enemies, and 
power-ups to restore health and/or energy. Following levels, RoboCop will have to match a criminal's 
face to the proper mugshot and engage in a first-person shooting bonus round.

robotfindskitten (c) Jan 28, 2003 
 
In robotfindskitten, the name is the game: You are robot, and you have to find kitten. Sounds simple. 
 
Problems start with the fact that there are other objects which are not kitten! Even worse: You don't 
know which objects are kitten and which are not! The only way to differentiate them both is touching. 
If you touch a non-kitten, you get some quirky phrase, otherwise: robotfindskitten! 
 
The game is a mindless yet meditative and (due to its idiosyncratic humour) quite fun lo-fi 
adventure-oid with some similarities to roguelikes (all-ASCII, single player, top-down randomized 
dungeon) and others to Progress Quest. 
 
It also comes with an impressive base of platforms, having been ported to over 20 systems, 
encompassing old and new, consoles and home computers. Particularly interesting is the OpenGL 3D 
Windows version aptly named robotfindskitten3d.

Control a Robot Rascal in a turn-based scavenger hunt that mixes strategy, action and board-game 
elements. 
 
The game included a set of physical cards, which told you what you needed to hunt for in the field or 
Laustenfownd. The first to find all the objects in their hand of cards wins. 
 
Luck cards can affect the outcome of the game. They give the player the chance to modify their hand, 
often at the expense of another player. Steal card, Force Swap among players or pass your trash 
either left or right are examples of the effects of a Luck Card. Each player must draw a Luck card at 
the beginning of their turn. 
 
The game allows you to choose among 10 different types of robots to use in your hunt, each with their 
own personality and style. You must also mind the type of terrain you wander into, because some types 
may damage your robot. 
 
The game also featured handicapping options, and, like most common card games, featured many 
variations of the original game by changing the way the cards are discarded, exchanged or displayed 
on the board.

Robots of Dawn (6428) (c) 1984 Epyx, Inc. / Epyx, Inc. 
 
In this text adventure based on Isaac Asimov's science fiction detective novel The Robots of Dawn, 
the player takes the role of Earth detective Elijah Baley, who is sent to the Spacer world of Aurora 
to investigate the murder of Dr. Han Falstofe, a prominent roboticist and constructor of humaniform 
robots. Suspects include Falstofe's political and professional rival Dr. Kelden Amadiro, his 
surrogate daughter Gladia, his biological daughter Vasilia, or ladies' man Gremionis, who was 
rejected by Gladia. Even Baley's robot friend and partner, R. Daneel Olivaw is not free of suspicion. 
In addition to the investigation, Baley must also deal with his fear of open spaces on Aurora, a 
result of having spent his entire life in enclosed spaces on the overcrowded Earth. Also, most 
Aurorans will not exactly be willing to help Baley due to anti-Earth sentiment. 
 
As typical with adventure games in the detective genre, puzzles are less based on item manipulation 
but more on gathering evidence and questioning suspects. In each game played, the murderer might be a 
different one - the location of items and people's reaction to questions differ accordingly. To 
convict the killer, Baley must determine motive, means and opportunity and present his evidence to 
the Chairman of Aurora.

Lunarium to reduce people's intelligence. However, in the 21st Century time travel has been mastered, 
as have jet-propulsion backpacks, plus some cataclysmic weaponry and advanced code-breaking

The game fits the Cinemaware template closely, with a string of action sequences linked by cinematic 
animation sequences to set the scene. There's also a strategic element, as you move your spies around 
to gain information and avoid detection, and decide how much Lunarium to use at each stage of the

You know, there's this ball, and it's stuck in a labyrinth for no apparent reason. Never mind -- 
let's just help him out, okay? 
You control the friendly, spotted ball with the cursor keys. It'll gain speed as it goes, bounce off 
when it hits obstacles, loose energy when it's caught in traps, die when it falls off the platform. 
The 32 levels through which you've got to guide the ball are full of traps: laser barriers, ramps, 
tubes, breakable tiles etc. Colored keys will open doors, switches create (or destroy!) helpful 
items. These include picks to repair floor tiles, parachutes to prevent you from falling off and 
bombs to destroy walls. Items have to be bought with coins that are found all over the level. 
The inertia of the ball has a very realistic feel to it, making the control intuitive and relatively 
easy. Not so easy, however, is the design of the (huge) levels

You are Cecil Pitt, a wannabe rock star manager. You must choose from 1-4 rock stars (with names such 
as Tina Turnoff and Wacko Jacko) to manage by viewing their audition tapes. Once you chosen your 
artists you then have to choose what kind of gear to get them - spanking new, second hand or dodgy. 
The dodgy gear is dirt cheap but you might pay for your choice later on in the game. 
 
To make your group a star, you have options such as practicing, publicity stunts, and buying gifts 
for your stars. Each action you choose advances the calendar by one day and you have until December 
to achieve your ultimate aim of superstardom - represented by a line graph which rises or falls 
depending on the performance of your band's releases. 
 
Once your band has recorded their first album you can choose to release the single and/or the album. 
The single needs a video to go with it which costs varying amounts of cash depending on which 
director you choose. You can choose to go for publicity, but this can be risky as there is a chance 
that one of your rock stars will be in the papers as an ex-rock star who died in any of many strange 
ways (all that's missing is a 'bizarre gardening accident'). Publicity affects your sales directly 
and also affects the crowds who attend your gigs. You lose the game if either you run out of money, 
or all of your rock stars die.

Rodland (6448) (c) 1991 Jaleco Ltd. / Storm 
 
Taking a rather literal view of the term 'slap-stick humour', Rodland features two fairies called Tam 
and Rit, whose mission is to rescue their mum who's been captured and taken to a castle. 
 
There are 40 screens to clear, all full of baddies, who are disposed of by grabbing them with a 
stick, and flipping them from side to side to inflict damage. The hits needn't all be inflicted at 
the same time, as it's possible to release them to move them out of the way. 
 
When killed, each bad guy releases some kind of extra, ranging from points bonuses to various devices 
which can be used to kill other enemies. 
 
Each level also contains a certain amount of fruit. If you can collect all of this (with some bad 
guys still alive - you move on immediately once they're gone) you enter a bonus game, in which each 
enemy's death results in one of the letters E,X,T,R and A being released - collect them all for an 
invaluable extra life. 
 
In the Game Boy version the difficulty lies slightly lower because the player can use his wand even 
when climbing ladders.

Rogue (6449) (c) 1988 
 
This classic dungeon-crawl uses ASCII characters (letters and some symbols) and basic colors to 
depict a rogue's epic adventure through the infamous Dungeon of Doom. Using a host of weapons and 
items, he explores the dark dungeons one step at a time in turn-based mode. There are 25 different 
types of monsters, symbolized with their initial letter (L for Leprechaun for instance) and they have 
different abilities and modes of attack. The dungeons are different each time you play the game. In 
their deepest level the greatest prize awaits...

Rollaround (6456) (c) 1987 Mr Chip Software / Mastertronic Group Ltd. 
 
In Rollaround you roll around (surprise) 20 levels, in a game which comes across as a more cerebral 
version of Marble Madness. The twenty levels each feature 9 screens worth of squares, with no 
scrolling across them as such. On each level you are set a target number of crosses of each colour  
to collect, with less and less leeway as to how many of the different ones are required as the game 
goes on. 
 
There are pre-programmed moving enemies on each level to plan around, but the level's blocks vary in 
many ways. There are holes on the levels, but these can be jumped by pressing fire. You can turn 
plain squares into either crosses or holes, both of which invert the status of the crosses and holes 
respectively as well. Mystery squares (whose effect can be good or bad) and clock squares (which stop 
the timing and slow the aliens) are also present.

Nearly 5 years before Rebel Assault and other fully-rendered CD-ROM titles popularised the 
rail-shooter gameplay, Tynesoft used it for a game with an unusual setting. You are on board a roller 
coaster which has been layered with targets to shoot out. 
 
The roller coaster follows its natural path, swinging from side to side and up and down, while you 
aim a turret at the targets and shoot them out. After completing its cycle, the roller coaster 
reverses, moving through the same area moving backwards. A co-operative two player mode exists, in 
which each player controls a crosshair. Make sure to hang on as the ride turns.

Rollin (6464) (c) 1984 ScandSoft / ScandSoft 
 
In Rollin, you must move through a maze arranged in a grid-like pattern. Each of the boxes has a 
number in it – by crossing all four sides, that total is added to your score. Enemies are moving 
around the screen and must be avoided – contact will cost one of your three lives. However, once you 
enclose all four of the corner boxes, they change colour and can be ran into for a points bonus which 
doubles from the initial 100 each time. 
 
The exact gameplay varies on each level. On odd-numbered screens, the levels are made up of dots, 
which can be eaten (for points) in any order. Even numbered screens are more restrictive – a section 
of line only remains ‘done’ if you then complete a box it is in contact with, without moving away 
from it.

back wall their opponent scores 5 points, with the first player to reach 35 being declared the 
winner. 
 
The screen is split into two, showing the view of each player, with the bat in the middle to start 
with. The game speed can be altered from adagio (slow) to vivace (fast), and the skill of the 
computer player can be altered, as can the screen colour. A 2-player option is included

After selecting a section from the initial screen of pipes, gameplay involves moving through

R-Type (6143) (c) 1988 Irem Corp. / Electric Dreams Software 
 
R-Type is a side scrolling shoot 'em up best known for its extremely tough and strategic gameplay.  
  You control the R-9 spaceship as it launches a last-ditch effort to repel the evil Bydo empire. 
 
The R-9 comes equipped as standard with a small gun which can only take down the smallest of enemies 
without firing several shots. By holding down the fire button, it can be loaded up so as to release a 
large burst of energy, eliminating all but the strongest enemies in its path. From time to time, pods 
will come flying in your direction. Upon being shot, they release an upgrade. The first one will 
invariably be the one called "The Force", which is a weapons pod that clings either to the front or 
the back of your ship, absorbing any enemy bullets or acting as a bumper with which you can fly 
head-on into them. You can also use it as an offensive weapon by firing it and pulling it back in. 
Mastering the Force is vital to surviving in R-Type, since it must be used both as protection against 
bullet clusters, as a remote controlled cannon, and in order to clear the screen from obstacles. 
Other upgrades give you target-seeking missiles or a bigger main gun. Different gun types, 
differentiated by their colour, serve different purposes. The blue one sends laser beams bouncing 
across the screen (good for tunnels), the red one fires straight ahead, and the yellow one follows 
any walls it may encounter (good for artillery emplacements). 
 
The stages of R-Type are made in an organic style, certainly inspired by H. R. Giger's artwork for 
the Alien movies. When it came out, it was considered trend-setting since it broke off from the 
stereotypical sci-fi mould of other shoot'em'ups. In part, the levels themselves are your enemy, 
which is exemplified by the fourth, where spider-like creatures weave webs that cover the screen and 
block your path, or levels with intricate tunnel systems. Still, the levels are best handled with a 
combination of strategy and reflexes, without the memorisation that is required of R-Type's 
contemporary rival, Gradius.

Rather tastelessly, the plot of this one concerns a catastrophic nuclear accident in Russia. You must

Gameplay is a Gryzor style flip-screen run'n'gun shooter (with occasional jetpack flights), with 
fairly unrelenting action. Power-ups are issued by a canister which you'll have to control in order 
to gain the weapon you want. The difficulty level is pitched high, as with Project X which was

Rubicon Alliance, The (13669) (c) 1987 Ariolasoft UK / Reaktor Software 
 
In this intergalactic 3D action-flight-simulation your mission is to save the Rubicon, an constructed 
anti-matter zone that was made by the alliance of the eight planets of the Hyturian system. In 2746 
after many centuries of war between the eight planets of the system, they decided to build up this 
anti-matter zone around the entire system as protection against each others. It worked fine for 
several decades - the peace remained unthreatened. But now the time has come that the Rubicon barrier 
has been breached, by the entry of a new planet and its hostile home race, the Space Thugs. Enter 
your Starfox fighter, save the whole system, and find out who breached the system. 
 
The action is viewed from the cockpit of your starfighter, which is equipped with lasers and 
side/rear-view mirrors. It also has a status log detailing your weapons and current threats, and an 
advanced 3-dimensional navigation system called the Holocube. Controlled from a separate screen, the 
Holocube allows you to rotate a 3D image of space and plot the co-ordinates of your journey. 
 
The player must manually navigate through wormholes for fast travel - contact with the edges drains 
your shield. Electrical and ion storms are a constant hazard - the easiest way to avoid these is to 
use the general log to note their co-ordinates. Weapons can be upgraded 
 
Starfox features eight missions to be completed in order. The first is to shoot down 60 Space Thugs.

In this platform game, each level is three screens long and consists of three floors connected by 
stairways that Rupert has to leap up or down. Collect all party invitations but watch out for 
marching toy soldiers, birds, planes and Jack-out-of-the-boxes. Touch any of them and Rupert loses 
one of his initial four lives. 
Luckily white-coloured baddies are willing to cooperate. Jump on them and they will transport Rupert

Once all party invitations are collected, a door to the next level will open. In all seven platform 
levels in the castle must be negotiated before Rupert can attend the party.

almost twice as much for it). It combines shooting (creatures such as spiders and hippos are among 
the many ferocious delights on show), and puzzle solving, largely involving manoeuvring objects. Once 
you run out of lives, the game tells you the percentage completed

Saint & Greavsie (12855) (c) 1989 Core Design Ltd. / Grandslam Entertainments Ltd. 
 
Saint and Greavsie is a sports trivia game where one to four players have to answer sport-related 
questions. Players start by throwing a ball across a series of stadiums. To the left of these 
stadiums is a green bar, and the higher the green bar, the greater the distance the ball will go. 
 
Depending on where the ball lands, the player has to answer three types of questions from one of four 
question packs. Home questions (worth one point) are generally related to modern football and are the 
easiest to answer. Away questions (worth two points) are generally related to football in the 1960s 
and '70s with teasers about 'golden oldies'. Finally, derby questions (worth three points) will test 
your knowledge of football trivia, and these questions are fun as well as factual. Players can choose 
to answer the question or pass onto the next player. If the player chooses to answer a question 
correctly, a penalty shootout is given which involves the player kicking a goal to score bonus 
points. 
 
The winner of the game is declared after all players have completed 21 or 42 matches (when one league 
season is completed). The winner is the player who has the most points.

Samber is a platform game similar to Lode Runner. It involves players collecting a number of items in 
the level, while avoiding several enemies that run around. Holes can be dug through the ground and 
are there for the enemies to fall through to the platform below. Once all the required items have 
been collected, the player proceeds to the next level. In later levels, there are colored-coded doors 
that can be opened by using the appropriate keys. Lives are lost when the player makes contact with 
an enemy or falls down holes.

Samurai Warrior - The Battles of Usagi Yojimbo (6558) (c) 1988 Beam Software Pty., Ltd. / Firebird

With the Roger Rabbit film (and game) successful, and the Jive Bunny phenomenon shaking up charts 
worldwide, perhaps it was time to redress the balance away from wimpy rabbits. Stan Sakai's comic 
character set in the 17th century did this, being capable of a range of martial arts moves. In this 
licensed game he'll need them to save Japan from being taken over by evil. 
 
The game is side-scrolling and has large beat 'em up elements, but also incorporates Karma. Negative 
actions such as needless violence will be punished with a loss of Karma, while positives ones (such 
as bribing those who give Karma) are rewarded. When in combat, energy gauges display the condition of 
both yourself and your rival. Money collected can be spent on food for energy boosts.

Santa Paravia and Fiumaccio (6560) (c) 1988 Starsoft Development Laboratories, Inc. / Keypunch 
Software, Inc. 
 
An intermediary step in complexity between the brutally basic HAMURABI and more sophisticated modern 
titles such as Civilization, Santa Paravia and Fiumaccio ushers you into a Merchant Prince setting, 
governing over a 15th-century Italian city-state, competing with the savage forces of nature and 
against up to 5 (7 in some later versions) other players in the hot-seat, seeing who can rise through 
the ranks to claim titles from COUNT, to MARQUIS, GRAND DUKE (and, finally, H.R.H. KING.) 
 
At its heart the game is, as are its predecessors, about bean-counting -- weighing your current 
reserves of grain (measured in steres) against your population's food demands, wondering how many 
gold florins the market price for your surplus will net, and how many hectares of land that'll permit 
you to purchase... and whether that investment will come back to haunt you the following turn if the 
weather shifts from feast to famine, when you have plenty of dirt and nothing growing in it to feed 
your grumbling populace.  However, the game cleans up real nice, and cute graphical depictions may 
help you to forget that your debauched Renaissance rule largely consists of moving debits and credits 
back and forth across a virtual ledger. 
 
Varying difficulty levels help you find your own comfort zone in which to engage bad harvest 
conditions, worse real-estate prices and, worst of all, the endless appetites of what must amount to 
hundreds of thousands of rats, endlessly nibbling at your reserves.  Surplus capital can be sunk into 
blue-chip investments such as marketplaces and mills, palaces, cathedrals and private armies.  If, 
after commissioning them all, you find you don't have so much surplus capital after all, you can 
always cook the books by adjusting several different flavours of taxes, tariffs and customs fees... 
but tamper too much and your local economy will be stifled! 
 
Nearly every downturn in this game has an equal and opposite check, or at least a balance, to keep it 
from demolishing your estate in a single swoop... however, early versions of this game, as with many 
titles of its era, may cruelly and arbitrarily cut your rule short with a random death.  All the more 
reason to carpe diem and do the best with what you've got, while you've got it.

Sanxion is a side-scrolling shoot'em up where you fight your way through wave after wave of colourful 
enemies, using a futuristic looking aeroplane. The screen is divided in two, with one third at the 
top of the screen showing a bird's eye panoramic view of the surroundings and your plane, and the two 
thirds at the bottom showing the actual battlefield. The scrolling speed is controlled by the player, 
as the scrolling slows down when the plane nears the left side of the screen, and picks up speed as 
the plane moves towards the middle. Sanxion does not feature any end-bosses or power-ups, instead the 
player is treated to a non-lethal bonus stage after each completed level, where the aim is to shoot, 
collect or avoid obstacles in a race against time.

Saracen (6567) (c) 1987 IntelliCreations, Inc. / Datasoft, Inc. 
 
A combination puzzle/action game from Datasoft.  In each of the 100 levels, the player moves a 
crusader through an obstacle filled maze trying to reach the Saracen Chief and detonate a bomb next 
to him.  The chief does not move, instead remaining in a set position. 
 
Along the way, he must avoid roaming guards, bouncing cannonballs, and other traps.  The crusader is 
armed with a bow and can pick up directionally specific arrows that are used to stop guards or 
destroy walls. The arrows being limited to shooting in one of the four compass directions is 
exacerbated by only being able to carry one object (key, arrow or bomb) at a time. For these reasons, 
the game's puzzle leanings and the need for a methodical approach are strong. 
 
There is generally only one way to solve each level and proper use of the given tools is key to 
finding it.

stronger in part two), you can collect swords to attack, as well as lightning bolts which can be

Items are often found by running through the sand with one's hands.

jumped over. Among the status bar are six pictures of the monsters, and a picture of a gravestone

Scenario (6597) (c) 1992 Starbyte Software / Starbyte Software 
 
Scenario is a turn-based strategy game, where your goal is to conquer the whole Europe. The game 
takes place on a map of Europe divided into a number of provinces. There are 4 players, each of which 
can be human or computer-controlled, and each player starts with 1 province and a small army in it. 
The rest of the provinces are independent countries, just waiting to be conquered... 
 
Armies consist of tanks, airplanes and ships. Each turn, you can freely move your forces between your 
provinces or attack neighbouring provinces (though each tank, plane and ship can be moved only once 
per turn.) Note that a ship automatically takes a number of tanks and airplanes when you move it. 
When you attack a province, whether it's controlled by another player or neutral, you can see how the 
battle goes. Of course, if you emerge victorious by destroying the opposing army, you take over the 
country. If there's no army in that country, you take it without combat at all. 
 
Producing new armies costs money. You get money from taxes paid by your citizens, but to get cash, 
you can invest into mining for raw materials (coal, iron or copper)

You're Caliph - king of Iraq. An evil wizard from distant land broke into your palace, transforming 
it into a maze of traps and puzzles, and taking the sacred Sceptre of Bagdad. Unless you can recover 
it, your spell as ruler is finished. 
 
Featuring lots of enemies to dodge, platform-style jumps and object manipulation, the game resembles 
the Dizzy games, with a Jet Set Willy-influenced setting. There are many objects you need to use, but 
you can only carry two at a time. You have 3 lives with which to complete the game.

The Scorpion battle machine is a new anti-terrorist device. Scorpion is being tested in a simulated 
refinery sabotage scenario. You move Scorpion along a network of pipelines, collecting bombs as you 
move along. Avoid the moving obstacles and shoot all bomb layers to clear the current level and move 
on to the next one. 
 
Since Scorpion can only move along the pipelines, you have to plan your way through each level 
carefully in order to avoid all those moving enemies. Fortunately, they move along in repetitive 
patterns and don't chase you. Gameplay is not easy because you have to very precisely take turns at 
the junctions. The game features Parallax scrolling.

dragon, a bear, and a hive of bees.

The city's sewer system has been infested by monsters, and LINDA, a maintenance droid, has been sent 
down to flush them out with her laser gun. Different monsters have various effects on her: some will 
terminate LINDA on sight, while others simply drain her power. Her power can be replenished by 
getting batteries scattered around the sewers. Also, contact with other hazards such as water, spike 
pits, and pods results in her immediate termination. 
 
LINDA may encounter a giant slime monster while navigating the sewers. Her primary objective is to 
destroy this monster, which take eight hits to kill. LINDA's laser gun will have no effect on the 
monster. So she has to collect eight grenades that are scattered around the sewers. LINDA can only 
carried one grenade at a given time. 
 
LINDA begins with five lives, but extra lives are awarded in the sewers, as well as bonuses and 
mystery objects. A report card at the end of the game shows, among other things, kills made, lives

SDI - Strategic Defence Initiative (6657) (c) 1988 SEGA Corporation / Activision, Inc. 
 
This arcade conversion is based around classic-style shoot 'em up action. It puts you in control of a 
satellite which must ensure that the wave of bombs aimed for the United States do not hit. Direction 
of motion and direction of fire are controlled independently - on the 16-bit versions you rotate the 
mouse left and right to direct the targeting, move it up and down to increase the range, and use the 
joystick to move the satellite and thus avoid any contact. 
 
Each level is split into defensive and offensive stages. On defensive levels you must stop each unit 
as it heads towards the earth, a lá Missile Command. Offensive stages follow the old 'shoot it before 
it becomes a danger' philosophy, being free-flying shoot 'em up sections among a network of 
destructible (but worth saving) platforms.

In Seafox, you control a submarine that must kill all hostile ships above and below the water.  You 
have two types of torpedoes: one that fires to the right and one that fires up.  You have a limited 
number of torpedoes and fuel units, so when you are running low be sure to watch for the green supply 
ship to release the dolphin that brings you fresh supplies. 
 
The enemies are varied and numerous. Enemy submarines pursue you below the water, and enemy 
destroyers on the surface can drop depth charges that slowly sink to the bottom and are deadly to the 
touch.  You must also watch out for your own torpedoes, because there are certain ships on the 
surface that are immune to your fire and reflect your torpedoes back down at you. 
 
You can control your submarine with either joystick or keyboard.

Seas of Blood (6675) (c) 1985 Adventuresoft UK Ltd. / Adventure International (UK) 
 
You are an intrepid pirate captain, commanding the corsair crew of the dread vessel the Banshee 
through the shipping lanes of Khul's so-called Inland Sea on an avaricious quest: to amass a hold 
full of lucre through treasure-hunting and outright plunder, transporting it safely through the 
troubled waters from wretched Tak in the north to the distant southern isle of Nippur. 
 
A loose adaptation (using many of the original's locations and situations, but often in new, 
streamlined ways) of Andrew Chapman's Fighting Fantasy gamebook #16, published earlier the same year, 
while this computer game version still ignores the gamebooks' Choose-Your-Own-Adventure 
multiple-choice design in favour of a limited two-word text-game-with-graphics interface, important 
elements of the FF system rejected in the earlier Adventure Soft conversion of Temple of Terror have 
been re-integrated into this adaptation -- notably the trademark Fighting Fantasy SKILL & STAMINA RPG 
stats-management and (simulated) random die-rolling for tracking damage and resolving combat.  
(Players hoping for the books' third dynamic are, well, out of LUCK.) 
 
An additional extraordinary element is carried over from the gamebook: ship-to-ship combat, with your 
crew manifest standing in to represent an analogue to your boat's STAMINA score (ability to sustain 
further damage) -- handy to maintain at high levels while attempting to fend off menaces both 
nautical and land-based drawn from many fabulous and folkloric sources including Homer's Odyssey and 
the annals of Arabian hero Sinbad the Sailor.  The conversion also continues the imposition of the 
text adventure convention of carry limits unknown in the gamebook, as well as pre-set character 
stats.  Perhaps in an attempt to increase the game's length (at the cost of its replayability), 
mutually exclusive side-quests from the gamebook all become mandatory stops here toward a larger new 
goal of not merely maximising one's treasure-accumulation, but systematically denuding the entire 
coast of anything shiny and not nailed down.

Secret Diary of Adrian Mole, The (6685) (c) 1985 Level 9 Computing, Ltd. / Mosaic Publishing 
 
Sue Townsend created a phenomenon in the mid-1980s, essentially incorporating lots of sharp satire 
and observational humour into the diary of a confused teenager. It might sound like an odd idea for a 
computer game, but Level 9 felt that there was an adventure in there. 
 
Most of the major characters from the book appear, including Adrian's warring parents and their 
respective flings, his sweetheart Pandora, his best mate Nigel, school bully Barry Kent, and 
curmudgeonly pensioner Bert Baxter. The game didn't use many typed commands. You would read passages 
of text (many of them from the book) and be given 3 choices as to what to do, which would lead to 
other events unfolding. Your aim throughout all of this was to make Adrian as popular as possible.

The gameplay is quite similar to that of the previous Gold Box games. Following the  AD&D rules of 
role-playing, the player creates a party of characters (up to the maximum of six). Exploration takes 
place in pseudo-3D environments, from first-person view. Battles (random as well as pre-set) take the 
player-controlled and enemy party to a top-down battle screen. Commands are issued in turn-based 
fashion, and the player-controlled characters can freely navigate the battle field. Unlike the 
previous games, there is no &quot

Sentry, The (12756) (c) 1986 
 
A surreal and very original game by Geoff Crammond 
 
The game plays out on a 3D landscape with hills and valleys made up of several levels. At the highest 
vantage point stands The Sentinel,  a statue-like being with an energy draining stare,  you begin at 
the lowest.  "Energy" plays an important role,  there's a constant amount in the game world and each 
object is worth a certain number of units - including you. 
 
The object of each level is to absorb The Sentinel and Hyperspace to the next from his vantage point. 
 
The Sentinel scans further round the landscape every few seconds - if you're caught in his gaze,  or 
rather the square you are standing on can be seen,  you'll have about 5 seconds to teleport to 
another location (or hit a key to teleport to a random location - which will never be higher,  and 
may be lower than your current level) before the Sentinel begins absorbing your energy,  when it 
reaches zero you will be destroyed. To travel a "robot hull" must be created on a visible square then 
teleported to,  making sure you absorb your old hull to avoid losing energy. Boulders and trees can 
also be created,  trees to block The Sentinels view and boulders can be stacked to gain higher 
ground. 
 
There are a few other elements to the game - on later levels there will be other Sentries positioned 
around the landscape. If only part of you can be seen i.e. not the square you are standing on, a 
nearby tree can be changed into a "Meanie"  which will ultimately force you to teleport. There are 
9999 levels in the game but the next level number is based on the current level + how much energy you 
have remaining. 
 
Sentinel Returns is a remake very true to the original.

Seymour goes to Hollywood to star in his first motion picture. As he arrives in his limousine, he 
soon discovers that the Dirk, the studio manager, has disappeared in Miami. Seymour must start 
production of his film by himself. 
 
Seymour Goes To Hollywood is a platform adventure, another Dizzy clone, this time replacing the egg 
character with an amorphous blob of unknown origin. Like in the Dizzy games, the main objective is to 
collect everything that isn't nailed down (using the fire button) to solve puzzles. In the upper left 
portion of the screen sits an inventory with three slots and besides that the score points and the 
energy bar. Seymour loses energy when touching dangerous objects and hazardous environments. When the 
bar gets empty, Seymour transforms into a pile of bones and the player loses one life. The game 
starts with three lives (shown as clack boards under the energy bar) and no way of saving progress.

General Zoff is holding Ambassador Kryxix captive in his spaceship. Plans for a new type of spaceship 
are hidden in a micro-disc embedded in the Ambassador's spine. If Zoff had the plans, the empire 
would be in great danger, and it is only a matter of time until his inquisitors will discover them. 
The Emperor has assembled the so-called "enigma team", a group of six reckless mercenaries, to take 
care of the situation. 
 
Players take control of all six mercenaries and have one hour and forty minutes to rescue Ambassador 
Kryxix and capture General Zoff. All six characters have different abilities. Syylk is an insectoid 
and a strong fighter, Zark Montor, the team leader, is an expert in unarmed combat and the only 
translator of the group, Servina Maris is the only character who can pick locks, Torik is an avian 
with thorough knowledge of explosives, Maul is a slow combat droid and Manto is a weak droid, but the 
only team member that can operate the transporter that is vital for the mission's success. 
 
Controls are completely icon based and the screen is divided into six sections. The upper screen 
section is called the mission command screen and displays which character is active, the active 
character's location and the status of all characters: whether they are moving, engaged in combat, 
weak or dying or performing certain action such as picking locks. The lower half of the screen 
changes depending on the situation and shows additional information and all selectable actions. 
 
From the main game screen (enigma team screen) players can choose one of the six characters and 
access four sub-screens: 
 
Character status screen: 
Shows a character's speed, strength, stamina (health) and carried weight. 
 
Object screen: 
Shows all objects present at a location as well as all objects carried by the selected character. It 
can be used to drop or pick up items, equip weapons and items or use special items. 
 
Movement screen: 
Here, the active character can be moved by clicking on arrows that show possible directions for a 
character to move. 
 
Battle screen: 
During battles, characters can scan the location to count and identify their enemies, move, attack 
with their equipped weapon, defend or retreat.

Shadow of the Beast (6735) (c) 1990 Reflections Interactive Limited / Psygnosis Limited 
 
While very young, Aarbron was kidnapped and enslaved by the Priests of the Beast Lord. He grew up on 
drugs made to destroy his own will and turn him into the Beast Messenger, a powerful creature serving 
Maletoth, The Beast Lord himself. He did his job, until one day he noticed a man about to be 
sacrificed in a ritual, his face triggering ancient memories... and as the sacrificial knife 
descended into the man's body, Aarbron recognizes the face. Of his father. 
As his father dies in the altar, memories of his childhood and tormented past at the hands of the 
Beast Lord emerged, and as feelings of hate over his captors took over him, he swore revenge and fled 
the temple, knowing the road to avenge his father and redemption would be hard. 
 
Shadow of the Beast, one of Psygnosis most popular titles during the 16-bit computer era is a 
side-scrolling platformer best known for the use of parallax scrolling along lush graphics, a musical 
score  by David Whittaker, a iconic cover by Roger Dean and what many consider to be unforgiving 
gameplay, balancing between the "very challenging" and the "impossible". The player has to navigate 
through several areas filled with enemies and traps, collecting keys and activating triggers than 
open new areas or give Aarbron the means to overcome a sub-boss. The number of moves the player has 
at disposal is limited: duck, jump and only two attacks: punch and a flying kick. While most enemies 
die with just one hit, the player must time each attack accurately. However, there are also traps of 
objects that cannot be destroyed, and these require the player to jump, duck or move according the 
sequence. The player has only one life with 12 hit points that can be replenished by collecting some 
objects hidden in the level (like an off-route location or a under a megalith), which also 
contributes to the difficulty level.

Shadow Warriors (6738) (c) 1990 Tecmo, Ltd. / Ocean Software Ltd. 
 
Shadow Warriors is a direct port of the arcade version of Ninja Gaiden. It is a beat'em up in the 
veins of Double Dragon featuring Ryu Hayabusa, a ninja who must fight members of an evil cult who 
seek to fulfil Nostradamus' end of the world prophecies. 
 
Ryu Hayabusa can attack his enemies using his his bare hands and feet or using a sword (for a limited 
time). He can also perform moves such as a flying neck throw, a back flip and hang kicks, performed 
while hanging in scenario objects. Throwing enemies against objects such as phone cabins, oil drums 
or dumpsters will destroy them, revealing power ups such as health items and swords. At some points, 
Ryu will have to perform acrobatic moves to carry on. He has a life bar starting with 5 units. 
 
The game takes place in United States' locations such as Las Vegas, North Carolina, Los Angeles, the 
Grand Canyon and Brooklyn. The enemies in those stages are mostly of the same 5 kinds, including 
Jason Vorhees' look-alikes and other masked men. There is a boss fight at the end of each stage. 
 
A two-player co-operative game is also featured. Whenever the player dies, a continue screen will 
appear showing Ryu chained to a table while a circular saw descends upon him.

The gameplay involves 144 tiles, each depicting different images, which have to be removed by 
matching them into pairs. The tiles are arranged in a gridded pattern, which is higher near the 
centre. A tile can only be removed if it has no tile next to it on at least one side. 
 
This computer implementation can generate a random board layout to take on, as well as featuring 5 
preset challenges, some of which have time limits of 5 or 10 minutes, as well as a multiplayer mode.

kick has a slightly longer range, the punch is a little faster. To gain an advantage over the 
enemies, it is possible to pick up various weapons including a machine-gun, throwing knives, or 
shurikens. Ammunition for all weapons is limited. Unlike many similar fighting games, there are no 
end-of-level bosses in the game.

Shotgate (c) Sep 17, 2008 
 
Shotgate was developed for the annual Mini Game Competition and was an entry for the 4k size 
category. It is a reworking of the Portal concept. Players need to survive through 26 rooms in a 
secret laboratory where the new Shotgate technology of jumping is tested. Each level is set on a 
single screen where the player can move left or right, but he cannot jump. Using the gun gates can be 
shot into walls or ceilings. As soon as two gates are set, the character can enter one to be 
immediately warped to the other gate. 
 
Ammunition is limited and so is the time available per level. As such, certain gates need to be 
re-used to save ammo. As with the game it is based on, there is a promise of cake at the end of the 
game. From the main menu passwords can be entered to go to the levels directly.

Shredz64 (c) Mar, 2008 Synthetic Dreams 
 
Shredz64 is a game modelled against the mechanics of Guitar Hero to play music on a guitar 
controller. Players need to match notes in five columns, each with its own colour, against the rhythm 
and melody of the music. Doing well increases the applause meter and when it runs out the game is 
over. Similar to Guitar Hero's star power, perfect parts increase a shredocity meter, allowing the 
player to lift the guitar, turning the screen border red and scoring additional points. The screen 
only shows the notes in a pseudo 3D fashion, with nothing else in the background. 
 
The game makes use of the PSX64 interface that connects PlayStation controllers to computers that use 
a DB9 port, and the Commodore 64 pin configuration. For the PlayStation 2 guitar controller, this 
does not only include button presses, but the whammy bar, strumming and lifting as well. 
 
The initial game was released with ten instrumental songs divided over different difficulty levels. 
It includes a mix of game soundtracks (Zelda, Zak McKracken), movie soundtracks (Beverly Hills Cop, 
Ghostbusters) and renditions of popular songs (Hotel California, Lick My Guitar). Players can add 
their own SID files to the game and record custom notes. There are separate PAL and NTSC versions, 
and high score tracking is included.

Shuttle Simulator (6800) (c) 1983 
 
This game is an early simulation of NASA's space shuttle, on a mission to retrieve a failed 
satellite. Most of the controls are handled using the joystick. The mission is comprised of five 
different stages: 
 
1. Launch: After an automatic lift-off out of Earth's gravity, you guide the shuttle to a 
   rendezvous point. 
Park: With the satellite in sight, approach it until you are right next to it. 
Arm: Use the robot arm to catch the floating satellite and bring it into the cargo space of the 
shuttle. 
Entry: Just like the launch stage, but without throttle control, you guide the shuttle to a target 
box indicated in the plotter instrument. 
Final approach: From an outside view of the shuttle, try to decelerate at the same time as dropping 
to an altitude of zero. 
 
The main view is from the cockpit, with a small stripe in the centre dedicated to the outside view, 
and the rest comprised of instruments and indicators. All of these instruments, indicating the stages 
of the mission, the attitude of the craft and its course, as well as altitude and speed, are 
functional. Certain parts of the mission are moved to an outside view for pædagogical reasons. To 
make the game more beginner-friendly, the mission is not aborted if a certain stage is not fulfilled, 
but points are awarded for how well each stage is completed.

Sidearms, Hyper Dyne (6802) (c) 1988 Capcom Co., Ltd. / GO! 
 
Originating in the arcades, Side Arms is a horizontally scrolling shoot ‘em up in which you control 
Lieutenant Henry (a second player can control Sergeant Sanders in some versions), armed with crude 
weaponry and protective jump-suits. They must save the earth from the mercenary invaders of Bozon. 
You must first reach Bozon’s territories, then wipe out its forces hidden in caverns and lurking in 
underground seas, before destroying the main invasion ship. Lots of extra weapons can be picked up, 
often with similar tokens to those in 1943 and some other Capcom titles. Most weapons can be shot 
either to the left or the right, giving you more range to launch attacks.

Pirates! (16074) (c) 1987 MicroProse Software, Inc. / MicroProse Software, Inc. 
 
Take on the life of a buccaneer in the golden age of Caribbean Piracy! This game lets you choose from 
6 different "ages" (for example, "The Silver Empire" from 1560-1600, "War For Profit" from 1640-1660, 
etc.), one of 4 nationalities (English, French, Dutch, Spanish), 4 difficulty levels, and one of 5 
special abilities (skill at fencing, skill at navigation, etc.). Nine different types of ships were 
represented. 
 
The goal of the game is to retire with as much gold and land as possible, as many ranks/titles as 
possible (Colonel, Admiral, Marquis, Duke), and a wife. Finding long lost relatives helps too. You 
accomplish these goals by plundering cities, capturing and sinking enemy ships, getting in good with 
governors to receive titles, learn news of "evil Spaniards" holding your relatives, capturing evil 
pirates, etc. 
 
The game is educational, as you will learn about piracy through the thoroughly researched manual. 
You'll smell the sea salt as you participate in wild sword fights, desperate sea battles, and daring 
attacks by land!

enemies will move faster and faster. When the enemy reaches the top of the wall the game is over. The 
more attackers you knock off the higher score you'll get.

Silent Shadow (6812) (c) 1988 Topo Soft / Topo Soft 
 
Silent Shadow is an arcade with a small aerofighter as protagonist. The objective of the game is to 
get unharmed with maximum discretion a huge bomber to destroy the enemy fleet in the Persian Gulf. To 
do so the player has a modern and sophisticated fighter whose power, speed and ability can get to 
create false images on the radar, making it worthy of the Silent Shadow nickname. 
 
To achieve the goal 4 phases must be overcome (airbase enemy, city, desert and the enemy fleet). The 
idea is not to depart too much from the bomber to avoid being hit by enemy fire, being destroyed and 
ending the game, but neither should you go too  slow because you could clash with the bomber, then 
losing the few opportunities you have. Expansionary pumps are available that can destroy all enemies 
in sight. The game allows collaborative game where up to 2 players can take one aerofighter.

essentials such as housing, transport links, schools, factories and shops. There are 50 types of 
these, allowing for homes of all standards and different types of businesses. Make sure to consider 
which sites are effective for which tasks. Some power sources pollute, others don't but are more 
expensive. Taxes must be raised to ensure an income, and then portions allocated to public services 
such as policing and roads. Earthquakes, floods and fires are all emergency situations that must be 
dealt to contain any damage. 
 
Successful mayoring will cause the small village to grow into a town, then a city and finally a 
metropolis. As the city's size grows so do it's needs. Commercial buildings may suddenly find that 
they need an airport to expand trade, or housing may find itself changing rapidly as vast amounts of 
people come and leave. 
 
The game also includes 8 pre-defined time-limited scenarios, with specific challenges and targets. 
The environment varies in each game (especially if you have the Terrain Editor add on), and this 
should affect your choices.

Simpsons, The - Bart vs. the Space Mutants (633) (c) 1991 Imagineering Inc. / Acclaim Entertainment,

Bart vs. The Space Mutants is a platform game where the player goes into the role of Bart Simpson 
(from the TV show The Simpsons) and must stop the Space Mutants from invading Springfield. 
 
On each of the five levels, Bart must collect (or get rid of) the ingredients that the Space Mutants 
are planning to use to build their machine, such as purple objects or balloons. He also has to 
collect enough "proof" of the aliens existence (brown coins left behind when they are jumped on), so 
his family members will help him when he meets a boss (characters such as Nelson and Sideshow Bob). 
This won't be easy since the Space Mutants are "using" human bodies as disguise. In order to discover 
who are the real Space Mutants, Bart must use his X-ray Specs. 
 
The ways Bart can get rid of those objects sought by the Space Mutants are numerous. For instance, in 
the first stage, Bart must get rid of purple objects. He can dye them red, cover them, wash them, 
etc. Some even involve a little puzzle solving, like playing a trick on Moe to make him get out of 
the bar. 
 
Bart also has some coins that can be used in many ways throughout the game, like buying things, 
getting devices operating, etc. Those coins are essential to solve some puzzles in the game.

In the game simulating some kind of golf you should complete the course consisting of 18 stages, 
putting the ball into the hole with as less strokes of the ball as possible. Each stage is presented 
on one screen in top-down view, it has a different shape, and different obstacles or gates are set to 
be avoided or passed through. 
 
Setting the ball in the field, you should select the direction and power of the stroke. The points at 
the end of each stage are calculated as subtraction of made strokes and pre-defined ones different

Sir Lancelot (6832) (c) 1983 Xonox / Xonox 
 
A damsel in distress is being held in a castle by a fire breathing dragon! As Sir Lancelot, you need 
to ride your winged horse Pegasus to the rescue. Each level in this action game consists of two 
screens. First you are outside the castle which is guarded by numerous flying creatures. You need to 
fly around the screen and destroy all of the creatures by hitting them with your lance (careful, if 
they hit you instead you'll lose a life). After all of the creatures are gone, you enter the second 
screen which is inside the castle. Here there is a large pit of lava and a flying dragon. To destroy 
the dragon you need to hit it's stomach with your lance. If you are hit by one of the dragon's 
fireballs you'll be temporarily stunned and unable to fly. If you end up falling into the lava, 
you'll lose a life. If you can defeat the dragon, the game repeats at a higher difficulty level. The 
game ends when you lose all of your lives.

Skate Crazy (6848) (c) 1988 Gremlin Graphics Software Ltd. / Gremlin Graphics Software Ltd. 
 
Pull on your skates and get down to the local car park where your prowess on eight wheels is put to 
the test in the 'Car Park Challenge'. 
 
The player grooves his way around one level of the car park which has been turned into a 
multidirectionally scrolling arena for the gladiators of roller racing. Kick cans over, litter to 
collect and obstacles to avoid in the shape of cones, ramps, sand, bouncing balls, flying frisbees, 
mazes of tyres and rocks, and even other skaters. Finishing each level is a battle against time to 
negotiate a series of gates in a set order, the next gate being signified by a row of dots which 
flash between its flags. 
 
To complete rounds successfully, though, suitably impressive stunts and tricks are carried out to 
appease a set of four judges. Each have a card which they periodically display at the bottom of the 
screen, notifying the player of his progress. When the player's energetic jumping skills have gained 
enough points to qualify, he skates through the finishing gate and has his performance rated. Failing 
to qualify forces the player to skate around the car park against the clock, picking up a set number 
of pieces of litter. Beating a level allows the player to skate to the level's exit ramp, from where 
he chooses to move up to the next level or leave the car park and move onto the next part of the 
game, 'The Skate Crazy Championship Course'. 
 
This section of the game is a race against time over four horizontally scrolling cityscapes of 
platforms and ramps, with the player building up speed on his skates using a paced joystick waggling 
movement. Ground level obstacles and gaps in the floor are crossed with leaps of controllable 
strength and items at head height are avoided by judicious ducking. Birds and other creatures also 
spell doom for the heroic skater, unless he is able to avoid them or throw things at them. 
 
Points are scored in this section by picking up extra skating paraphernalia, such as pads, clothes, 
skates and litter.

Skate or Die! (6849) (c) 1987 Electronic Arts, Inc. / Electronic Arts, Inc. 
 
Skate or Die incorporates five distinct styles of skating, which can be attempted individually or in 
turn. You skate around a menu room to choose which one to attempt. Before taking off you can visit 
Rodney's skate shop to buy equipment. 
 
The first event is freestyle, in which your aim is to score as many points as possible in 10 
attempts. Judges determine how much style and skill you have shown. The High Jump uses the same 
equipment, only this time your task is to jump as high as possible at the end of the ramp. 
 
The downhill events are overhead-view races. In the Downhill Race you simply try to complete the 
course within 90 seconds. In the Downhill Jam you try to outperform a human or computer opponent 
whilst dodging or jumping hazards. You can use attacking moves to either remove hazards or knock your 
opponent over. 
 
The pool joust is more of a one-on-one beat em up using a stick, set within a pit to skate around.

All this has to be done around all the rigors of a typical school day. you must go to class when the

You fly your spaceship through a cave system split in six sections. Pressing the joystick button will 
unleash both your front mounted gun and your bombs. Missiles will launch in your path in order to 
intercept you, and you must not only shoot those down, but also bomb all fuel cisterns you see, or 
you will run out of fuel. 
 
The second cave section introduces aliens that fly up and down in your path. 
 
In the third section, you are met by fire balls which are immune to your bullets. 
 
The fourth section is played out in a very cramped space, where you have little time to react to the 
missile launches. Here, the graphical style changes into a more technological one than the natural 
caves earlier on. 
 
The fifth section is equally cramped, but with steep shafts which must be descended into or ascended 
from with precision, due to the speed at which you are moving. 
 
Finally, the sixth section is an infinite loop where you must bomb a single enemy construction before 
you run out of fuel.

The gameplay is flown in third-person perspective, while you are controlling your vehicle (skimmer or

accelerating and decelerating changes the speed, and shooting keeps you alive. Harvester is a boss, 
which appears after certain number of enemies will be eliminated, and it should be destroyed. 
Upon defeating the harvester the game awards the player with money, and loops back to the moment of 
time, when player controlled the skimmer. Collision with any obstacle means game over.

The last of the evil Drune Wizards who have been ruling Lyonesse is dead. Don't get the champagne out 
yet though, because his evil power lives on until his name (which, as with all the Drunes, is a 
closely-guarded secret) is said. The only person who knows it is his daughter, who is trapped in 
Small Sky Tower. This, coupled with the fact that she's reputedly beautiful, is all the incentive 
Slaine needs to track her down. 
 
The game system is unusual - known as REFLEX, it is menu-based, but these menus appear and disappear 
in real-time, meaning that the game has a constant aspect of pressure and time-sensitivity. You must 
collect and examine objects, map your way through Lyonesse, and use your mighty sword where needed. 
Slaine must keep an eye on his Warp rating, which drops in unsuccessful combat but is replenished 
either by physical (eating food) or mental (the high of winning a battle, or having a run of time 
without one) factors, and has a big effect on his performance.

The big and nasty Americana monster has come along and eaten up Mastertronic's pinball table where 
the Slamball family resides, a living clan of ball bearings with a happy deposition. The pinball 
table is inside the monster's stomach and the balls are in a bit of trouble. The pinball table is 
still operational, and since the monster's stomach knows that the family is still inside, it has 
decided to eject them one by one. The hole at the bottom of the table, which normally recovers the 
ball, instead slides down into the monster's digestive tract. 
 
Luckily for you, as a member of the secret society of prevention of cruelty to pinballs, have gained 
radio remote control of the table, and you must now stop at nothing to prevent any of the Slamball 
family from getting into the Americana Monster's digestive tract. 
 
The whole game revolves around a vertically scrolling window of four screens that form the entire 
length of the table. As you launch the ball, you need to decide on the power at which the ball is 
ejected into the playfield. Four sets of flippers are positioned throughout the table

Slam-Dunk is a two on two basketball game. Play against the computer or against another player. The 
game is divided into 4 quarters of three minutes each. The team with the highest score at the end of 
the final quarter wins. An overtime session can occur if the game ends in a tie. 
 
The game provides a practice session. Here you can learn the moves and plays needed to beat your 
opponent. 
 
You control one of your players on your team. Your teammate will be controlled by the computer, based 
on your movements of the controllable player. On offense, you control the man with the ball. On 
defense, you control the man guarding the ball. On defense, you can switch your controllable player 
by moving the joystick right while pressing the button. 
 
In this fast paced game, fouling can occur if defense plays too close or offense shoves its way into 
a defensive man. After five fouls, free throws will be shot. If you're shooting free throws, simply 
hit the button to take the shot. Made free throws count as one point. 
 
Keep an eye on the shot clock. Don't get caught holding the ball. Remember that any shot taken and 
made outside the three-point line is worth three points.

the blocks to a destination color.  The game has a very obvious Q*Bert influence.   However, there 
are some original elements as well. 
 
Various objects float about the screen, like magnets, clouds, raindrops, and other monsters.   The 
monsters are the only one that are a direct threat.  The magnets can only grab you if you are not 
moving.  The raindrops actually give you greatly increased speed, and the clouds turn you 'dusty'.  
Be careful, if you get hit by both a raindrop and a cloud, then your spring rusts and is dragged off 
by an oil-can. 
 
In addition to having five lives, you also must avoid running out of points.  An 8000 point bonus 
appears briefly over various squares, and you need to catch at least some of them, because every jump 
decreases your points, and getting 'killed' and knocked off the blocks decreases points even faster.

Slugger (12896) (c) 1985 Platinum Productions / Imagine 
 
In this early UK-developed baseball simulation, one or two player matches can be played over 3,6 or 9 
innings, with 3 different computer skill levels. The rules are explained by some introductory 
screens, and the game is fully faithful to these. Gameplay is in an arcade/action style, so you don't 
need to worry about statistics for different teams or players. 
 
The main viewing area is a forced-perspective view of the field, with a small side-viewed window of 
the pitcher's delivery itself. When fielding, control automatically goes to the player nearest to the 
ball, but a point doesn't end until the pitcher has the ball back (unless it is a home run). Features 
include stealing bases, pitching curve balls, or customizing the colors of each team. 
 
The game has been presented with considerable glitz, with cheerleaders on screen between innings and 
lots of advertising boards and other slogans.

Sly Spy Secret Agent (6933) (c) 1989 Data East Corporation / Ocean Software Ltd. 
 
With a clear James Bond influence, Sly Spy must stop terrorists destroying parts of the city in this 
collection of sub-games. Roughly half of these (starting with level 2, and alternating from there on) 
are side-scrolling Green Beret-influenced offerings, not entirely dissimilar to a great many Ocean 
movie licenses. There are bad guys to shoot and bullets to avoid, with boxes to climb up on and 
strategic positions to shoot from behind cover. 
 
The first level involves skydiving down the screen and shooting at the agents as they themselves fall 
- complete this and you'll safely parachute to the ground. There's a motorbike chase, in which you 
must shoot out and dodge agents. Two underwater levels follow, in which more enemies and some sharks 
must be shot. Before reaching the final multiple-enemy showdown in a missile factory full of the 
baddies from the game.

SMASHED - The Strangest Mobile Army Surgical Hospital East of Detroit (6939) (c) 1987 Alternative 
Software Ltd. / Alternative Software Ltd. 
 
Pigseye Peers is a newly-qualified surgeon sent to join the mobile military hospital unit in Korea - 
the Strangest Mobile Army Surgical Hospital East of Detroit, or S*M*A*S*H*E*D for short. Thus, the 
game is a clear spoof of the very popular TV series, M*A*S*H*. It is an adventure using text inputs 
with occasional graphics. 
 
Your job is to get a still back, but you have no idea where it is nor how to get it - the supplied 
instructions offer little more than a command list. Usually, you will get a description of the room, 
as well as a listing of items, vehicles, and possible exits. To go in another direction, all you need 
to do is just enter the first letter of the direction that you want to go (eg: N for north).

Smurf It! was developed for the annual Mini Game Competition and was an entry for the 4k size 
category. 
 
This is a simple sliding puzzle game, made to celebrate the 50th anniversary of the Smurfs' creation 
and containing two Smurf pictures. At the beginning, you have a 5-second peek at the picture, and 
then it gets shuffled randomly. Once one picture is completed, the other one appears. 
 
The puzzle pieces can be moved with a joystick. Moving the joystick to the right will move the piece 
which is to the left of the blank space, moving it down will move the piece above the blank space, 
etc.

or any part of your own ever-growing body, and a door to the next level opens. Thread your way 
through the door and you start over again, this time on a more complicated screen. As you move from 
level to level, the obstacles become more difficult. 
 
As you play, bars on each side of the display inch toward the top of the screen. Should they complete 
their journey before you've eaten an apple, you are penalized: Three more apples are added to the 
total you must eat before completing the level.

The first in a series of 'edutainment' titles long before the portmanteau term was popularized by 
marketing executives, Snooper Troops had younger players trying to solve the mystery of "The Granite 
Point Ghost", an entity that is trying to scare the Kim family out of their new home. 
 
Using the SnoopNet computer, players will comb the streets of the neighborhood looking for clues, and 
investigating people's houses while they're away.  Speed is of the essence, as if your Snooper Troop 
is caught when the owner of the house returns home, you could be thrown off the case for good! 
 
The title encourages players to keep facts on people, map the neighborhood, review clues, receive 
special messages, and ultimately, find enough information to accuse and convict the criminal trying 
to chase the Kim family out their home.

You can choose to be an existing pilot or to create a new one. 
You can choose between 2 levels of difficulty: beginner (less enemy attacks) or expert (the most 
dangerous). 
The weather will affect the mission. The good weather will be great for training, and the stormy will 
be dangerous but great for attacks, as you can hide into the clouds and approach the enemy unnoticed. 
You'll have a copilot that will help you telling what's going on every moment. 
You can avoid missiles using your skills, using chaff or... if you can't, you can use your parachute!

Soccer Pinball (6993) (c) 1992 
 
Soccer Pinball is a pinball game with eight round split across three tables. On the soccer-themed 
levels, a 'goal' is guarded by 'defenders' who must be removed by hitting them. Score three goals to 
reach the next level - initially you will face another soccer-based table with more defenders. Other 
football-themed elements include 'throw-in' positions from the side and pop-up players to toggle for 
points. 
 
On the Amiga version, the later tables have a casino and gambling as a theme. Gameplay is 
fundamentally the same - hit the correct targets in sequence to advance, with other targets adding to 
your score.

next round. Each matrix is guarded by two sentinels trying to stop you. The sentinels wander around 
the perimeter of the matrix, and will shoot fireballs at your spaceship which can destroy it. You are 
unarmed, so your only defense against the fireballs is to avoid them. To help you out a bit, your 
ship is capable of flying at two different speeds. Each round begins with a 'skip-a-rack' timer

Solo Flight (7019) (c) 1985 MicroProse Software, Inc. / MicroProse Software, Inc. 
 
A simulation that has you flying Mail runs from many different airports in one of 5 states of 
America.For a game that arrived some 24 years ago now, it still manages to feature an impressive 
amount of remarkable details for the time, such as VOR towers readings, DME, ILS, and coupled with 
the game aspect that is to deliver post,  Solo Flight is clearly quite unlike what you will have 
played before 
 
Score for choices made meaning you must ponder certain things like how much fuel you might need for 
each delivery.Each mail delivered is to a different airport but the option is also there to carry 
several loads, each an additional weight that needs to be taken into account.Having a heavier payload 
means burning more fuel and a difference to how the plane handles, but potentially a higher score can 
result.It's this design that makes Solo Flight so intensely fun each time 
 
Various weather conditions such as clear, nightime, light cloud and even a heavy cloud that requires 
IFR skills.It's entirely possible to fly using just instruments in total cloud blindness up until the 
point you pop out of a cloud to see the runway hopefully as you had planned.Indeed an accurately 
planned route using both VORS can have yourself precisely lined up and ready for a final descent 
using ILS. 
 
You really do need the maps though and attempting Solo Flight without them is fairly pointless - 
playing this seriously requires maps for VOR plotting.

Solomon's Key is a platform game with both action and strategy elements. On each level your goal is 
to retrieve a key which can then be used to unlock the exit. To help out, you have a magic wand which 
can be used to create and destroy blocks (though some blocks can't be destroyed). In order to reach 
the key you will need carefully to arrange the blocks on the screen so you can jump your way around 
safely. Wandering around each level are a variety of enemies which will cause you to lose a life if 
you're caught. Some creatures can be killed by destroying the block they are standing on, others must 
be dodged. Hidden bonuses and magic can be found on many of the levels, sometimes even hidden in 
blocks. Some treasures give you bonus points, others can form magic spells to help deal with the 
enemies. To make the game more difficult, each level has a time limit in which it must be completed.

Sooty and Sweep's Fun With Numbers (7028) (c) 1990 Enigma Variations Ltd. / Alternative Software Ltd. 
 
Six short mathematical tests aimed at children up to 7 years of age come together in this package. 
Sooty the silent magical bear is one of the UK’s most enduring children’s characters, and his friends 
Sweep the squeaking dog and Soo the talking bear join him here. The games can be played with little 
or no computer knowledge, and feature full graphics. 
 
In Magic Numbers the player must count how many wands Sooty has on the screen. Sweep’s Bones involves 
moving bones from a pile on the right (Sweep’s stash) to the left (the ones he will enjoy today). 
Soo’s Hats is an addition test. In Bigger/Smaller you are presented with 2 numbers, and asked to 
select the biggest or smallest, which Sooty will magic away with his wand. Order Order presents a 
line of numbers, some of which are filled in, and challenges the player to select the others (which 
are randomly arranged elsewhere on the screen) and place them in the correct positions. Soo’s Race 
brings these skills together – you are asked a succession of questions, and answering them correctly 
will see Sooty’s car move along a track, and hopefully win its race against Sweep.

Sorcerer Lord (9035) (c) 1988 Personal Software Services / Personal Software Services 
 
Sorcerer Lord is a medieval fantasy game of tactical warfare. 
 
The evil Shadowlord's army is threatening to overrun the peaceful country of Galanor. The alliance of 
races in Galanor isn't very fond of suppression, slavery or extinction, so they are preparing for war 
-- it's your job to coordinate the Galanorian defense. 
 
Movement and combat are turn-based. You and the Shadowlord alternately recruit new troops, move 
armies on a 2D hex-map of the land and try to conquer the enemies garrisons. The outcome of fights is 
shown as plain text only. Although the gameplay is quite simple, there are a few tactical knacks like 
certain races fighting more fiercely in certain terrain types, fatigue levels and basic statistics 
for army leaders. Despite the game's title, magic is a rather unimportant element of chance in 
battles and not under your direct control. 
 
The game contains a time limit

SOS (17340) (c) 1986 Mastertronic Ltd. / Mastertronic Ltd. 
 
Sydney the Droid has crash-landed his plane on Alpha Five, and he must search the city for the plane 
radio so that he can signal a rescue team to his location. While searching for the radio, Sydney must 
also avoid being eaten by robots that patrol the city. When he gets eaten, one of Sydney's three 
lives are lost and Sydney restarts from his present location. 
 
His progress is blocked by several obstacles, including computer terminals, fences, and barriers, but 
these are removed by using them with objects found elsewhere. 
 
The game is broken up into days, and as time passes, the city eventually gets dark, making progress 
impossible without a lantern. The bottom half of the game screen shows Sydney's status as well as 
what he is carrying.

Space Academy (7044) (c) 1989 Elite Systems International Ltd. / Elite Systems International Ltd. 
 
As a recruit of the space academy, you must complete numerous tasks, most of which test your 
dexterity and occasionally requiring some button-mashing. The tasks are divided into fitness training 
and weapons training. Before you can begin weapons training you must complete the fitness training. 
 
Fitness training starts with running: waggle the joystick as fast as possible to let the recruit run. 
After that, you have to balance on a rope: A bar at the bottom of the screen goes left or right, 
press the joystick into the opposite direction to prevent the recruit from falling off the rope. The 
next discipline, steeplechase, works similar to running, except that you also have to jump over 
obstacles. After the steeplechase you must balance on a rope again, but this time you also have to 
avoid obstacles by ducking or jumping. In the next discipline, the recruit has to hold on to a small 
device that runs along a rope, pulling up his legs at the right moment to avoid running into 
obstacles. After that he must jump at the right moment to touch moving targets with his hands, while 
the grate that he stands keeps getting pulled away. The penultimate discipline requires him to crawl 
through a narrow tunnel, ducking under obstacles and avoiding laser beams. While the recruit crawls 
forward automatically, you can only push down to dodge obstacles and keep him still. Don't take too 
long though, as he is constantly losing stamina. For the last test, the recruit must walk in a hand 
stand over a grate. Waggle the joystick until the power bar turns red, then press fire to get to the 
next rod. 
 
Once the fitness training is complete, the weapons training can begin. Here, several courses have to 
be completed while either dodging or shooting various obstacles. Sometimes the recruit moves 
automatically and you can only jump or shoot. Sometimes the recruit can fly and you have full control 
over him. While it's usually enough to make it to the end of a course, you are sometimes required to 
destroy a set number of targets.

Space Crusade (7058) (c) 1992 Gremlin Graphics Software Ltd. / Gremlin Graphics Software Ltd. 
 
Space Crusade is a science fiction strategy game converted from the Games Workshop/Milton Bradley 
boardgame, in which you control a commander and four marines who are sent on different missions 
aboard hostile alien starships. Your commander starts off as a sergeant, but he can work his way 
through the ranks. The game allows three players, each commanding one marine chapter each. The alien 
team is `played` by the computer. 
 
The game is a literal conversion of the board game in the same vein as Gremlin's earlier Hero Quest. 
It can be best described as a turn-based board game in which the player must fulfill the primary and 
secondary objectives to complete the mission, which usually involves elimination of entire alien 
force on board or destruction of mothership etc. This game features unique 3D close-ups during the 
battle scenes, a feature which was later adopted by games like the X-Com series.

Space Gun (7070) (c) 1992 Taito Corporation / Ocean Software Ltd. 
 
2039 A.D. Man begins deep space exploration in search of new life forms and usable fuel sources. What 
he discovers is trouble. 
 
Until now, the success of past explorations was causing the space effort to grow by leaps and bounds. 
Until now, the explorers had found little more than fungus and small insects as alternative 
lifeforms. Until now, the chief dangers had been 
those posed by the hostile environment of space. Until now, the aliens had not known about THEM. 
 
On the ragged edge of the galaxy, other creatures that roam the stars discover humans and spaceships 
to be excellent sources of food and other resources. Prepared at the worst for clashes with rival 
exploration teams, the human crews can do little to 
defend themselves as wave upon wave of nightmare 
creatures descend upon their ships and bases. 
 
In response to their distress calls, the Federation has assembled a series of rescue teams, lead by 
their best military sharpshooters, to deal with the alien menace. As the leader of one of these 
teams, you must gun down the intruders and pick up the human survivors. Brave the maze of dark 
corridors that may lead to a deadly shootout between you and legions of monsters. Pick up survivors 
and extra ammo on the way.

Harrier) going off to save "Fantasy Land". This combined with the many flashing gaudy colors the game 
throws at you leads me to believe that it was born out of a bad acid trip. 
 
There are 13 stages to complete by jetting around and blasting bad guys and bosses as they approach. 
The game is played from behind the main character and the landscape rushes up in 3D similar to the 
effect used in many car games such as Outrun. 
 
The game uses many of the enemies and bosses from the first Space Harrier, but adds an array of new 
ones as well.

enough food transporters to help people survive. There are 15 star systems to search, and successful 
voyages through these will push your rank up through the 11 available. 
 
A radar is provided to help you identify enemy ships, as well as more precise co-ordinates relative 
to the targeted ship. The status of your fuel load, ammunition and shields are constantly measured. 
 
To obtain food (and refuel and replenish supplies), you must land on a planet and roam the surface, 
at which point the view changes from 3D to top-down, and the gameplay takes on a mazey aspect.

Space Rogue (7098) (c) 1989 ORIGIN Systems, Inc. / ORIGIN Systems, Inc. 
 
The Princess Blue was a trading vessel. While cruising through space, it happened upon a derelict 
ship floating in space. Only one crew member was allowed to investigate the abandoned ship. Suddenly, 
Manchi raiders appeared on the viewscreen. The Manchi managed to ambush and destroy the Princess 
Blue. As the only surviving crew member from the Princess Blue, you swear revenge... but it's a big 
and expensive universe. In order to upgrade and repair the ship, you'll need credits. Which could be 
obtained through trading or hunting down pirates or maybe a special mission or two. There's also the 
matter of finding those who are responsible for the death of the Princess Blue. Following their trail 
will require obtaining information from several different characters. 
 
Space Rogue is a space simulation, a predecessor to Origin's better known Wing Commander series and 
specifically, Wing Commander: Privateer. Space flight takes place in two different modes: Cruise 
Flight, which is ideal for travelling quickly, and Newtonian Flight, which works best for combat and 
precision flying. Each planetary system has a variety of destinations and obstacles to travel through 
via a top-down navigational map. 
 
Interstellar travel, between systems, is done by finding a Malir Gate and using it to reach 
hyperspace. While in hyperspace, the game becomes a simple 'tunnel' game where you must manually 
control the ship not to hit any of the walls. Also hyperspace travel eats away at your ship, so the 
faster you can get through them, the more armor your ship retains. Finally, when docked on most 
locations, the game shows your pilot from a top-view and you can walk to different 
shops/bars/characters.

to launch the Discovery, establish an orbit around the Earth, open the cargo bay doors and recover a 
satellite to perform repairs, and finally land the Discovery successfully, all while using as little 
fuel as possible. Each time the complete mission is accomplished, it will then repeat at a higher 
difficulty level (in the higher difficulty levels the satellite has a more erratic flight path). The 
game is played from a first person perspective in the space shuttle cockpit where you can control 
everything from the shuttles engines to cargo bay doors. When the game is over you will be given a 
ranking which is based on the number of successful dockings and the amount of fuel that was used. In 
addition to the full flight mode, two easier game variations (autosimulator and simulator mode) are 
included. The autosimulator mode is the easiest

In Spare Change, you are the owner and operator of the Spare Change Arcade, dedicated to making your 
place of business run as smoothly as possible. Inside the arcade are Token machines, jukeboxes, 
telephones, movie booths, popcorn machines, and so on. The token machines need to be restocked with 
money from the cash register when they are out of tokens, but eventually, the register must be 
replenished with cash from the safe. You must drop the tokens in one of your two storage bins. When 
you have stored at least ten tokens, the movie booth opens, and you can go inside to proceed to the 
next level. You are also awarded one bag of money, but if you store more than ten tokens, then more 
than one bag of money is awarded for each extra token collected. If nine bags of money are obtained, 
you proceed to the next level. 
 
But the Zerks, two aliens that run around the screen, can steal tokens either from the machines or 
from the storage bins. Sometimes, a Zerk will toss a token to the other nearest the "piggy bank". You 
must touch them in order to get the token back, before they throw it in their piggy bank.  
Alternatively, you can throw a token into the jukebox, telephone, popcorn machine, etc. and the Zerks 
will get distracted from their goal, giving you enough time to continue filling the storage bins. If 
the Zerks insert five tokens in the piggy bank, the game is over. 
 
Between levels, an intermission plays, which are similar to those in Pac-Man. Later in the game, you 
have the ability to access these intermissions. As you proceed through the levels, the game gets 
quite difficult.

Speedball II (7170) (c) 1991 Bitmap Brothers, The / Image Works 
 
Brutal Deluxe doesn't live up to their name - in fact they're the worst team Speedball has ever seen. 
As their manager, it is your job to transform their fortunes. As well as the league system, which 
consists of 2 8-team divisions and challenges you to advance to the top, there are also 2 cup 
tournaments, one of which is played out over 2 'legs' with the aggregate score deciding who 
progresses. 
 
You can play the matches as well, which is the real meat of the game. They consist of 2 90-second 
periods, and the gameplay is futuristic, fast and frantic, with heavy tackling encouraged to retrieve 
the ball. Power-ups and tokens appear on the pitch, including ones to make your players extra-tough 
or freeze the opponents. 
 
The sides of the pitch each include a score multiplier, which you can run the ball through to 
increase the value of your scoring - the opposition can sometimes immediately grab the ball and 
nullify this. There are also 5 stars which are worth 2 points each if you hit them (more if you have 
the multiplier activated), but these can also be cancelled out by the opposition hitting the same 
star, and their points values only become set after the half. Next to the stars there are 'portals' 
which throw the ball out the opposite side of the pitch, in the direction it was going. 
 
You get money for the results, and by collecting the silver tokens which appear on the pitch at 
random intervals. Between each match you can spend these either on improving your existing players as 
far as they can go, or on buying better ones and fitting them into the team. Your original players 
can only be improved to a certain extent, so remembering where your signed players are and making use 
of them is important. 
 
A variety of tokens also appear during the match, some of which boost your team's power for a short 
period of time, and one freezes the opposition.

Speed Buggy (7156) (c) 1987 Tatsumi Electronics Co., Ltd. / Elite Systems Ltd. 
 
Buggy Boy is a race game, but not just an ordinary race game. There are five different routes, 
offroad, north, east, west, south. The offroad course loops around back to the start, the others are 
long runs with a distinct beginning and ending. You must complete each leg before the time runs out. 
 
Along the way you can pick up all kinds of bonuses. The colored flags are 30 points each, collect all 
colors in the order as indicated at the top of the screen to get 1000 bonus points. There are several 
gates the give you 100, 250 or 500 points, and a time gate. Drive through a time gate to collect it, 
you receive two seconds extra time upon completing a leg. Occasionally there will be a soccer ball on 
the road, hit it and it will fly away and you get 2000 points. 
 
There are bridges and tunnels, be careful not to fall off the bridge into the water or crash into the 
tunnel wall. There also are obstacles like boulders, logs and fences. If you hit them it will cost 
you valuable seconds off your leg time. But if you hit a log or small stone just right, the buggy 
will ride on two wheels until you hit something again.

Magic Knight's second game (after Finders Keepers) sees him travelling through time to rescue 8 
people including his tutor Gimbal, who have become locked in time thanks to a faulty spell. 
 
The game invented a whole new control system, essentially pioneering the use of icons and windows in 
adventure games. You control a pointing finger, which can be moved onto each of the menus to reveal 
sub-menus, which contain the main options for object manipulation. 
 
All objects can be examined in detail, which produces a visual display of them, and possible clues as 
to their usage. You must look after your character's health and energy levels - carrying too many 
objects will progressively weaken him. You must also look after and direct the trapped characters 
once you locate them.

You'll have to time your jumping well, because a slight fall will lead to your death, and the abyss 
is near! You should jump over various obstacles, avoid ghost-like enemies, climb on ropes, and use 
inventory items such as bombs to create little explosions that will bring you nearer to the desired 
treasure.

Spherical (7196) (c) 1989 Rainbow Arts Software GmbH / Rainbow Arts Software GmbH 
 
Solomon's Key is a clear conceptual influence for this action puzzler. Our hero must guide a ball 
through a level to the spot marked 'In', by creating and removing blocks to alter its path. The game 
is prevented from being a pure clone due to the ball, which moves automatically once activated, and 
can be controlled by using strategically-placed blocks. 
 
Simply reaching the ball usually involves modifying the level layout using these bricks. There are 
enemies moving on fixed paths which must be avoided, and bonus items to collect. Also watch for 
bonuses such as invincibility, gravity-alteration and teleporting. You take time to rotate, so the 
controls aren't truly immediate. The ball takes 20 seconds to start moving, so use this time to plan 
ahead.

Spikey in Transylvania (7210) (c) 1991 Genesis Software / Codemasters 
 
After a rough crossing of the North Sea, Spike the Viking is  washed ashore.  He ends up in 
Transilvania, which seems to be just an ordinary village.  However, he finds out that his shipmates 
have been captured, and are being imprisoned in the dungeons of the local castle.  Spike must rescue 
his friends from the mysterious castle, but first he has to escape from the (apparently friendly) 
villager's house where he finds himself, as the door won't open. 
 
The game is a mix of puzzles and action.  The action involves you dodging various enemies, such as 
dogs, ghosts, bats, etc, and avoiding the many traps in the dungeons of the castle. 
 
You only have a limited amount of energy, and if you lose all of it by touching enemies or traps, you 
lose a life.  If you lose all your lives you lose the game. 
 
The puzzles, which are mostly fairly simple, involve both the use of objects, such as money to bribe 
a guard, and switches that perform various functions, such as deactivating traps. 
 
Keys are very important, as they are needed to unlock your shipmates' cells.  Some cells are 
protected by guards, who must be tempted away somehow to get to the cells they are guarding.

This flight simulation sets you as a young Spitfire pilot in 1940, when World War 2 is hotting up in 
the skies over the south of England. The program is viewed from within the cockpit, with the 
instrument panel viewed by pressing Space. The pilot will have to co-ordinate landing gear, brakes 
and ruddering, and use a map to navigate and find targets. Loops, rolls and split-S moves are all 
incorporated in the simulation logic. 
 
The game can generate random combat situations - for example, 6 enemies 10 miles away, 1500 feet into 
the air. Once you have established a strong flight record you can take on the missions. Additionally 
there are practice modes for both flying and combat.

This game is based on the long-running British satirical television show with puppet likenesses of 
political figures and celebrities.  A prophet determines that a world war will occur in seven years 
instigated by a mysterious leader.  To avoid this, one ruler of the world must be determined in this 
beat 'em up involving six rulers: U.S.A.'s Ronald Regan, the U.K.'s Margaret Thatcher, the USSR's 
Mikhail Gorbachev, South Africa's PW Botha, Iran's Ayathollah Khomeini, and Pope John Paul II. 
 
Having chosen which to play as, you travel to an opponent's country to engage in a best-of-three 
fight that is judged by Queen Elizabeth II on a postage stamp.  You attack each opponent on the 
ground as well as jumping in the air and each character has a special move like Thatcher's head-butt 
or Khomeini's beard whip.  You can also call for help twice from an aide who will usually throw a 
projectile at your opponent. 
 
If you manage to defeat all 5 opponents, you will meet the mysterious leader in a final showdown in a 
mud-wrestling pit in the dark where you will only be able to see the eyes of the characters.  You can 
also play 2-player fights, one against another on the same computer.

As an experienced ghoul-chaser, you think you can handle anything when you get a call to explore a 
haunted mansion. You soon realize that you're wrong, however, and you'll need all of your skills to 
deal with 384 screens of spookiness. 
 
It's an arcade adventure, with ghosts to avoid as they cause your character to fall off course, 
sometimes down a screen or two. Collecting bugs and beetles allows you to use one of the cauldrons to 
produce spells to kill enemies. You have 4 minutes on each life, although more can be picked up from 
the many egg-timers around the screens. The game keeps track of your 'Scaredyness factor' and adjusts 
the game difficulty to help struggling players accordingly. 
 
The eventual target is to collect items to turn into letters - earning enough of these allows you to 
play a Hangman game against the 'spooky old man'.

Alternative World Games Is a series of mini games based around the theme of an Olympiad for the 
non-sporting minded. It is intended to be a spoof on all serious sporting simulations. 
 
There are eight games in this compilation, some are one player and some are two player. The minimum 
number of players names that can be entered is two, the game setup insists that a second player is 
named because thee are two player games. The maximum number of names that can be entered is six. 
 
The game menu selection screen has been designed to look like a bank of nine TV screens. Each TV is 
displaying a sporting channel name. The player selects the channels to be played and presses 'Fire'. 
This causes an animation to commence on the appropriate TV. The player can select either one or all 
eight games. Channel nine is used to allow the player to select between competition and practice 
modes. 
 
At the end of each game the scores are displayed. After the last game has been played the game 
displays the medal table, there can be a long wait while the game reads to the end of the tape to 
find this program. 
When the selected game(s) have been played the medal table is displayed and the gaming session is 
over. If further game-play is desired, e.g. for a rematch, then the whole game must be reloaded and 
the player selection process has to be repeated.

Spy Hunter (7263) (c) 1984 Bally Midway Manufacturing Co., Inc. / SEGA Enterprises, Inc. 
 
A conversion of the arcade game, Spy Hunter is a driving action game played from an overhead point of 
view. Your car is equipped with machine guns to help you get past the numerous enemies out on the 
road (be careful not to shoot any civilians, though!) Occasionally you will come across a weapons 
van, and if you drive into the back of the van your car becomes equipped with a second weapon (such 
as smoke screen, oil slick, or missiles.) At several points the road splits and you can enter a 
boathouse which transforms your car into a boat temporarily. If you drive far enough the seasons 
change as well (watch out for icy conditions during winter!) The enemy cars will do anything to stop 
you, including running you off the road, firing guns from the back of a limmo, or dropping bombs from 
a helicopter.

M.A.D. magazine’s comic strip of the same name comes to life in this game which was designed for 
  one or two players. The innovative split-screen shows both spies at the same time. Play with a 
  friend or against the machine. 
 
The black crow and the white crow are out to beat each other before the time bell rings. Find the 
needed objects by digging through drawers, closets and furniture in the house. Foil your opponent by 
setting creative booby traps in the various rooms (a bomb in a dresser drawer, for instance). 
 
Fights ensue when both spies enter the same room.  Find hidden weapons in the rooms to help with 
those fights, since one of you will die if you run into each other.

A good alternate title for this one would be Rows - not the kind you have when your wife finds 
lipstick on your shirt collar, but as an equivalent of Columns. The gameplay is essentially the same 
- groups of 3 variably-colored blocks fall towards the bottom of a 6x18 grid, and you must arrange 
them into groups of 3 of the same colour - except that the blocks are grouped horizontally rather 
than vertically. 
 
Each individual brick falls as far as it can when you place the trio, so they won't necessarily all 
end up on the same line. Blocks fall as far as possible to fill gaps when lines are completed, so 
there are never gaps in the arrangement the way you get in Tetris. Each level sets you a target 
number of lines to form - 4 or 5 in a row count as 2 and 3 lines respectively for this calculation, a 
lá Klax. Horizontal lines score the least, with diagonals the most lucrative and vertical in between 
(this change from Columns makes sense considering the different building method).

Star Fleet I - The War Begins! (1st Edition) (7313) (c) 1985 Cygnus / Cygnus 
 
In Star Fleet I: The War Begins, you are a cadet fresh out of Starfleet Academy and have assigned to 
command your first U.G.A.S. Starship! The Federation is currently at war with Krellans and Zaldrons, 
so choose your first ship from the Federation starport and prepare for your first mission! 
 
The graphics of the PC version of Star Fleet I: The War Begins are represented by ASCII characters. 
Everything from your starship, the mainframe to torpedoes are all ASCII characters. 
 
Gameplay 
Gameplay consists of fulfilling the target number enemy kills mentioned in the mission briefing in a 
specified amount of time. Higher levels demands more kills and less time requirements. Gameplay 
consists of 2 major areas: 
 
1. Main Computer and Navigation 
Your starship is equipped with state of the art navigation equipment. The main screen displays your 
main visual display, consisting of the main star chart map, your current position and visual 
displays. Other sections/information of the starship maybe accessed through the appropriate buttons. 
 
Navigation may be conducted automatically or manually. Standard navigation (automatically) is 
conducted by accessing the main computer and setting out a course. Higher levels may result on random 
events during navigation (such as electrical storms, running into asteroids or enemy ships). 
 
Each map is randomly generated and also uncharted. Each quadrant is represented by numbers, where 
each number refers to: Stars, Starbases and number of enemy ships. Your starship is also equipped 
with long-ranged sensors to view adjacent quadrants an well as short-ranged sensors to view your 
current surroundings. For even further exploration, your starship also has probes to scan far-away 
quadrants. 
 
Combat: Starships, Starbases, and Marines 
Combat is the essence of gameplay in Star Fleet I: The War Begins. Entities in a combat situation may 
consist of the following: Your starship, enemy Krellan starships (max 5 per quadrant), enemy cloaked 
Zaldron starships (usually one per quadrant), allied Starbase  and Space Marines. 
 
Combat initiates when your starship enters a hostile quadrant (portrayed by a red number on the main 
map), usually patrolled by a minimum of 1 (one) Krellan starship. Red Alert is automatically set 
(unless configured otherwise) resulting the rising of shields and direct attack by enemy starships. 
 
Enemy starships are either Krellan starships or the Zaldron cloaked. Krellan starships fire only 
phasors to soften up your shields. Although your starship is greatly over-matched compared to a 
single Krellan starship, numerous enemy ships will prove very dangerous. Zaldron starships are unique 
as they have the ability to cloak (invisible on the both map screens). Zaldrons also use phasers as 
their main weapon. 
 
This type of combat consists of either eliminating all hostiles in the present quadrant (by 
destroying the enemy ships) or by capturing those ships (and optionally delivering them to a 
starbase). Your main arsenal consist of Phaser, Torpedoes and Mines. Torpedoes are reserved for 
direct destruction of enemy vessels. Phasers are usually reserved for the intent of disabling an 
enemy vessel for capturing purposes. Mines are used to damage enemy vessels that have the bad habit 
of moving around when eluding your torpedoes. 
 
Capturing enemy vessels may only be conducted when the enemy vessel is disabled (by phasers or other 
means). Space Marines then must board the adjacent ship and automatic combat occurs between your 
space marines and the enemy crew. If successful, the enemy ship will be captured as well as some 
power reserves and enemy prisoners. Be warned that enemy prisoners or enemy spies may board your ship 
without your knowing and damage your ships systems (indicated by "Intruder Alert"). The enemy ship 
may then be towed to be transported to a Starbase. 
 
If enemies prove to much for you and your heavily damaged ship, you can opt for "Self-Destruction". 
Be warned, you will survive but it may hamper your mission score greatly. 
 
Unique combat situations refer to "Starbase Under Attack" where an allied Starbase is under attack by 
enemy starships, requiring your immediate attention for rescue. 
 
After successfully completing a mission, your mission success is rated: Number of enemies destroyed, 
captured, starbases rescued, etc. You will then be considered for a promotion or a commendation for a 
medal!

Starflight (7371) (c) 1989 Binary Systems / Electronic Arts, Inc. 
 
A long time ago, a great empire comprised of Humans, Velox, Thrynn and Elowan ruled the stars. The 
Empire's currency was an energy source called Endurium. But something happened and this empire is no 
more. Furthermore, the small colony world named Arth has forgotten this heritage and technology. 1000 
years have since passed and the people of Arth have rediscovered archaeological evidence of their 
empire. Using these discoveries, they create spaceships and form the Interstel corporation to govern 
the fleet. It's time to take the first steps back into space... but could it be the same enemy that 
destroyed the Empire still exists? 
 
Starflight is a space exploration game. The player must first form a crew, assign their positions and 
customize the spaceship before blasting off from spacedock. Once out into space, the standard 
interface allows access to different crew members and navigation. The entire galaxy is unknown and 
it's up to the player to travel to distant planets to explore and land on them. Using a top-down 
interface, a planetary lander will venture out with the task of  finding minerals and biological data 
to transport back to Starport. These resources can then be used to train crew members and improve the 
ship. Different alien races control the galaxy and it will be up to the player to engage them 
diplomatically or engage them in combat. Successful exploration of the galaxy and alien cultures will 
yield clues and new leads as to the fate of the Empire.

you must now carry humanoids to safety through the Stargate of the title.

The Planet Novenia has been attacked by the Egrons, who snuck in by disguising their craft as the 
protected Starglider species, which Novenia's automated defenses were programmed not to shoot. 
 
Your task is to fight them off using only an obsolete Airborne Ground Attack Vehicle. This was 
designed as the ultimate combat machine, with sophisticated hardware up to Draziw Yarg's high 
standards. It has a fully-rechargeable shield, plasma drive unit, an inbuilt scanner and 
10,000-sector map, a top speed of 2550 Urads and two homing missiles. 
 
The game is viewed from within AGAV's cockpit, with control over speed, weapon targeting and firing. 
There are several control options to decide exactly how the craft works, with fixed or floating 
sighting, and the option of automatic centering, allowing you to balance the game between easy 
sighting and advanced shooting ranges. 
 
Repair depots must be visited frequently, as they can refill the weapon bays as well as repairing the 
ship. Crucially, the Egron Stargliders need 3 missiles to shoot down, so at least 1 visit to a depot 
is required to complete this job, at which point you move up to the next, harder, level.

word relates to.

Star Paws (7321) (c) 1987 Software Projects Ltd. / Software Projects Ltd. 
 
The Tasty Space Griffin, a rare, bird-like creature, is considered a delicacy and has acquired great 
value. On the moon of a distant planet, mercenaries have been secretly breeding the Tasty Space 
Griffin and plan to flood the market in order to destabilize it, which they hope will allow them to 
seize power. Because of an error on part of the notoriously unreliable series seven astroplex, the 
task to destroy this evil plot rests in the paws of the ill-prepared Captain Rover Pawstrong. 
 
Players take control of Pawstrong and must help him chase and kill all 20 Space Griffins on (and 
below) the surface of the moon. The looping playing area is presented from a side-scrolling 
perspective, with the bottom of the screen showing  a radar indicating the position of Pawstrong and 
the Space Griffin he is chasing. Pawstrong's health is represented by a cooked Griffin which 
disappears over time, but gets replenished when a Griffin is caught. The most straight forward and 
least effective way to catch a Space Griffin is to simply jump on it. It is advisable however, to use 
some of the items that can be picked up from boxes randomly dropped on the moon's surface by a 
spaceship. These items include transportation devices like anti-gravity pads or rockets, weapons such 
as rocket launchers or explosives and food that replenishes some of Pawstrong's health. A mining lamp 
is needed to see inside the mines under the surface of the moon. Here, Pawstrong can also pick up 
ammunition for his weapon. When he finds and uses a matter transporter, he is taken to a different 
part of the moon from where he can attack The Space Griffin with his catapult-style weapon. Finally, 
a bonus puzzle can be found which requires the player to rearrange a picture, similar to Split 
Personalities, within a time limit.

Starquake (7385) (c) 1984 Bubble Bus Software / Bubble Bus Software 
 
As BLOB, the Bio-Logically Operated Being, you are sent into an unstable planet and charged with the 
task of preventing it from exploding. This involves collecting various items (the exact combination 
is different every time you load the game) and taking them to the planet's core. 
 
The game is an arcade adventure viewed from the side, with 512 screens arranged in a 16x32 pattern. A 
teleport system exists, so once you find the codes you can get quick access to different parts of the 
game. 
 
The creatures to avoid are intelligent, getting tougher to predict as you get closer to the centre, 
but you are armed with a gun and can also try to avoid them. BLOB has a set of platforms which can be 
used to allow limited vertical movement, but these disappear after a few seconds each use.

Star Ranger is a comparatively slow-paced side-scrolling Shoot'em Up. The player's ship can shoot in 
two directions, but the shooting frequency is rather low. Unlike in most other Shoot'em Ups, enemies 
do not simply fly through the screen and can be either destroyed or dodged. Instead, they stay 
onscreen, trying to destroy the player's ship until they are defeated. There are numerous different 
enemy types, each following a unique attacking-pattern. Some enemies try to close in, while others 
always shoot from a distance. There are also bombers, who fill the screen with indestructible bombs, 
as well as ships that can become temporarily invisible. To further increase the challenge, there are 
also passages in which asteroids have to be dodged or the ship has to be maneuvered through narrow 
passages.

Starfleet Command is attempting to contain a rapidly growing Federation mutiny in the Sagittarius 
Arm. Every Federation starship set to discover the nature of the problem has also mutinied and joined 
the Klingons. To avoid the mutiny spreading to the entire Federation, Starfleet plans to wrap the 
entire area in a Klein Sphere, sealing it off forever. 
 
In a last attempt to find out what is happening, Starfleet sends in the Enterprise before the Sphere 
is set up. Its five year mission is to attempt to discover what is causing the defections, and 
hopefully stop them. If you fail in your mission, the Sphere will be made permanent, if you succeed 
the Sphere will be dropped, avoiding a potential war with the Romulans. 
 
The game is basically a graphical adventure with some real-time combat and piloting. The game 
progresses by flying to planets, beaming down on them, and retrieving any items you find. There are 
several possible solutions to the game, with clues found along the way.

First, you control Princess Leia on a speeder bike racing through the forests on Endor. You have to 
evade trees and deal with enemy troopers by shooting at them or luring them into Ewok traps. 
 
In the second sequence, you control Chewbacca who has captured an Imperial AT-ST Walker, evading tree 
traps and shooting at enemy walkers. In this sequence, the perspective sometimes switches to the 
Millennium Falcon which you must guide through a fleet of enemy Star Destroyers and TIE Fighters. 
 
In the final sequence, the Millennium Falcon enters the Death Star and has to make its way to the 
reactor, surviving more TIE Fighters and laser turrets. Once the reactor is destroyed, you have to 
get out again before the explosion engulfs the ship. 
 
After the Death Star has been destroyed, the game restarts at the first sequence, but with a higher 
difficulty.

The arcade game from Atari Games based on the second Star Wars movie features four action sequences 
inspired by the film. The graphical style is similar to the first Star Wars game, using vector 
graphics with a first-person perspective. 
 
The first sequence takes place on the ice planet Hoth, where the player must destroy Imperial probe 
droids. The droids send transmissions to the Empire that can also be targeted and destroyed. Once 
enough transmissions have been sent, the Empire attacks. 
 
In the second sequence, the player has to fend off Imperial walkers, either by shooting a limited 
number of tow cables at their feet or by targeting a small area at their head with lasers. But sooner 
or later, the Rebel base's power generator will be destroyed and the evacuation begins. 
 
In the third sequence, the Millennium Falcon has to destroy TIE Fighters in space. 
 
In the fourth and final sequence, the Falcon must navigate through an asteroid field, avoiding 
collisions. 
 
Once the four sections have been completed, the game restarts at a higher difficulty level.

After the fall of the Second Galactic Union in 1716 GY, a ten-thousand-year dark age settled upon the 
galaxy. Interstellar travel was nonexistent, and many star systems descended into a near-barbaric 
state, buring coal and gas for energy, and growing food directly from exposed topsoil. In 11,203 GY, 
a treaty between the Empires of Tremain and Galium formed the Third Galactic Union. Ships of the 
Stellar Patrol (a pseudo-military wing of the Union government on Tremain) began exploring the 
galaxy, searching for the human civilizations that are the remnants of the Second Galactic Union. You 
are a native of the planet Gallium, one of the most politically powerful but culturally barren worlds 
in the Union. Your great-great-grandfather was a founding officer of the Stellar Patrol, and for five 
generations, your family has served in the Patrol. It was always taken for granted that you would 
sign up as soon as you came of age. Once in the Patrol, you discovered that the exciting career 
promised in all the Patrol recruitment brochures was nonsense. Your life was drudgery and demerits. 
The one time you got to see an exotic planet was right after a big parade, when they needed a detail 
to sweep up all the confetti. Then came your big moment: shipwrecked on a seemingly deserted world, 
you met an exuberant robotic companion named Floyd. Together, the two of you discovered the secret of 
that mysterious planet, Resida, and saved it from near destruction. As a result of your heroics, you 
were offered, and quickly accepted, a juicy promotion. Good-bye Ensign Seventh Class -- hello 
Lieutenant First Class! No more scrubwork! No more bathroom details! No more cleaning groth cages! 
Finally, your life in the Stellar Patrol would be as exciting as those brochures had promised! Oh, 
how naive you'd been. Your daily routine simply replaced tedious scrubwork with tedious paperwork. 
Since your planetfall on Resida, five long years have dragged by, without a single event worthy of 
note. Why, just look at today's "thrilling" assignment: scooting over to Space Station Gamma Delta 
Gamma 777-G 59/59 Sector Alpha-Mu-79 to pick up a supply of Request for Stellar Patrol Issue

Steg the slug has to feed his family of "T'yungunz".  To do this he must blow bubbles to catch the 
grubs that they feed on and guide them through the level by blowing on them or nudging them past any 
obstacles in the way to the nest where T'yungunz live.  To complete a level, you must make sure that 
a certain number of T'yungunz are fully fed so they go to sleep.  If they don't get enough food then 
eventually they die. 
 
The levels are full of contraptions such as bellows, and obstacles such as spikes and fire that will 
burst the bubbles.  Some of these can be activated or deactivated using various switches. 
 
Usually Steg navigates each level by walking on the floor, and also he can climb up the walls and 
even walk on the ceiling.  There are also devices he can contruct out of the parts from the Acme 
Bionic Bitz Catalogue, such as the Rocket Pack, and Bionic Legs, which allow different ways of 
getting around each level.

Stellar 7 (7414) (c) 1984 
 
Gir Draxon, Supreme Overlord of the Arcturan Empire has declared war on the Terran Federation. The 
leaders of Earth respond by sending the Terran Fleet on their way to Arcturus to intercept Draxon's 
armada. But this was a deadly mistake: the Arcturans have discovered warplinks, which allow them to 
transport troops from one link to another instantaneously, even across vast interstellar distances. 
With the fleet halfway across the galaxy, the enemy has already reached the Sol system and occupied 
Saturn's moon Titan. Now, humanity's only hope is the experimental Raven armored vehicle. One 
courageous pilot must take the Raven through seven different star systems, from Titan to Arcturus, 
defeating any and all Arcturans, using the warplinks to travel from one system to the next. 
 
Stellar 7 is a first-person action game inspired by Atari's Battlezone, with similar wireframe 
graphics. In each of the seven levels, the player must defeat a number of enemies. Doing so reveals 
the warplink that takes the Raven to the next system. 
 
Next to a cannon, the Raven is equipped with radar, shields, and a cloaking device. The cloak drains 
the energy level of the vehicle substantially, and the depletion of the energy reserves or the 
shields destroys the Raven. Some of the levels include fuel bays that allow the player to recharge 
the energy. 
 
Various enemies await on the different worlds. These include both ground vehicles (sleds, tanks, 
hovercraft) and aircraft as well as stationary laser turrets, homing bombs, robot drones and more. 
All enemies vary in firepower, speed and armor ratings. An in-game mission briefing introduces most 
adversaries, but some special ones come as surprises.

Steve Davis Snooker (7425) (c) 1985 CDS Software Ltd / CDS Software Ltd 
 
Mike Lamb recreated the basic rules of the popular English game of snooker in this simulation, which 
can be played by one or two players, but has no computer opponent as such, unlike the later 16-bit 
remake. 
 
Instead, you are scored based not only on how many points you score legitimately, but also on how 
many points you concede through foul shots, and how many shots you take in total. You always take the 
next shot, even if you've missed or fouled, so in a one player game the break-building strategies can 
be slightly more aggressive than in a real match, as there's no risk of leaving an opponent a chance 
 
As in the real game you start off by trying to pot a red (there are 10 or the real 15, depending on 
which mode you choose), and if successful choosing one of the 6 colours (by pressing the number 
corresponding to its points value). Once you've lined up the direction of the shot, you will have to

Stickybear Town Builder (16149) (c) 1984 
 
The game starts with a green expanse of land, awaiting development.  The player selects different 
kinds of buildings to erect on the site, which the game instantly builds and automatically connects 
with roads.  Then, in the two play modes, the player gets to navigate a little car through the lanes 
and byways, as on a top-town map, trying to situate the car on a map location or at the site of a 
hidden key described only in cardinal directions (go south!  now south-east!)

Stifflip & Co. (7427) (c) 1987 Binary Vision Ltd. / Palace Software, LTD. 
 
Count Chameleon recognises the importance of the game of cricket to the power of the British Empire, 
and knows that a simple Rubbertronic Ray to scupper the ball's bounce is all it takes to bring their 
power down. You control the team of Viscount Stifflip, Professor Braindeath, Colonel R G Bargie and 
Miss Primbottom, as they attempt to stop him. 
 
The bulk of the game is icon-driven, and allows you to switch between the four characters at will. 
The control options are all described in slangy English terms, so instead of talking to characters 
you 'Chinwag' with them, and fights are called 'Fisticuffs'. These are a key aspect of the game, 
requiring prompt arcade reactions and correct move selection, especially as using the low blow too 
often results in a character being wiped out.

Stone Age (7440) (c) 1992 Stonehenge Soft Art / Eclipse Software Design 
 
Stone Age is a challenging puzzle game where you are in control of a dinosaur and you have to make 
him reach the exit of each cave. The dinosaur can only walk on certain blocks on the level: some are 
just ordinary blocks, some are movable in the direction the arrow points, some crumble after you walk 
on them, and some have coloured keys which are needed to get past locks of the same colour. 
 
The game has two difficulty modes, one giving you more time to complete the levels than the other, 
and every time you run out of time, you lose a life. The levels are coded so you don't lose your 
progress when you quit, although you'll lose any score gained. 
 
The graphics are simple and cartoony, and the levels come in a variety of scenarios. The game also 
includes a Jukebox, which allows you to customize the played tracks much like a playlist editor.

Storm Across Europe (7453) (c) 1989 Strategic Simulations, Inc. / Strategic Simulations, Inc. 
 
The game allows to simulate World War II in Europe on a grand strategic scale. The player controls 
land, sea and air action and has to manage limited resources for production and advanced research. 
 
There are 6 historical scenarios included in the game, and they are labelled after the turn that they 
start on, from Autumn '39 to Summer '44. A scenario builder can be brought into action for players 
wanting to change the starting situation. It allows for the modification of an area's terrain type, 
population or raw material points it contains. The player can transfer units or change the beginning 
levels of the major powers like research and reinforcement. 
 
Each game turn represents three months of action. The game map covers every part of the European 
conflict - from North Africa to Sweden, from Gibraltar to the Ural Mountains in Russia.

Stormbringer is the fourth and final game to star Magic Knight, and the only one to make it onto 
16-bit systems. Magic Knight must meet with his alter-ego, the Off-White Knight, by reaching his 
castle hideout - which means clearing 64 screens of adventure. 
 
As with the rest of the series, the game uses a largely visual system, in which a press of the fire 
button calls up a menu of options, such as 'examine', 'pick up' or 'cast spell. Selecting these calls 
up a sub-menu to choose what should be examined or thrown, which objects to combine, which spells to 
cast, and so on. The objects to be used include a chicken, a disguise and eggs. One new feature is 
that bolts of lightning are fired down at Magic Knight from the sky, and these must be avoided.

number of "hit points" so you must time your releases to steer the ball over treasures while avoiding 
laser cannons and evil black "zombie" balls.  Once you have obtained the correct numbers and types of 
treasures, an exit opens which takes you to the next of the 20 mazes.

You are Ryu, a Street Fighter. Your goal is to travel to 5 countries (Japan, USA, England, China and 
Thailand) and beat 2 enemies at each of them. Many of these characters, such as Adon, Gen, and 
Birdie, are later seen in the Street Fighter Alpha series. 
 
After each country you will have the chance to get additional points in a little bonus round, a 
feature seen later in most Street Fighter games. 
 
The final boss in the game is Sagat, who is the second to the last boss in Street Fighter 2. The goal 
is to become the greatest fighter in the world. As with most tournament fighting games once you have 
defeated the boss the game will reset and start from the beginning with a harder difficulty level. 
 
It is possible to start a two player game but there will be only one fight (between the two players) 
which will determine who will travel the globe to fight the computer controlled opponents.

Street Fighter II (7471) (c) 1992 Capcom Co., Ltd. / U.S. Gold Ltd. 
 
The original Street Fighter II is a famous fighting game. Players select from one of eight 
characters: Ryu, Ken, Blanka, E. Honda, Zangief, Chun Li, Guile and Dhalsim to do battle with. They 
must then use their combat strengths to defeat the other seven fighters followed by four boss 
characters: M. Bison, Vega, Sagat and Balrog. Each character represents a certain country and has 
their own reasons for wanting to win against the others. 
 
Each character contains his own selection of basic fighting techniques based on three styles of 
punches and three styles of kicks. The effect of each of these changes depending on the characters 
orientation (ducking, airborne or standing still). Street Fighter 2 made famous the "button 
combination" style of gameplay used to unleash powerful moves specific to each character. These 
include the ability to project fireballs, channel electricity or capture the opponent in a tight 
suplex. 
 
Street Fighter 2 is one of the most cloned fighting games and its effects on gameplay and fighting 
games specifically can not be understated. Street Fighter 2 is responsible for making popular several 
different elements.

Year is 1963 and you're one of the hotshots aspiring to be king of the county. You're given a small 
sum of money to buy your first car. Tune it for maximum performance and off you go. In the diner 
where other hotshots are waiting to take your prized possession, you race for money and pink slips 
and if you win, you get to take home their cars! 
 
The game's interface is relatively easy and fun to use. You have your own garage as the interface 
itself. Options are in the form of the garage's elements such as the clock for the game's main menu 
and the newspaper as your source for buying cars and parts. Add to that a third person with an 
attitude that talks to you as you play It's really a neat idea by which up to now, no other racing 
games have that style. You feel that you're living a virtual world as opposed to just going from menu 
to menu. Another realistic part is the ability for you to sell your car and haggle

Street Surfer (7481) (c) 1986 Sculptured Software, Inc. / Mastertronic Ltd. 
 
Jump on your skateboard and take a ride along an highway! Clear the highway of empty, thrown-away, 
bottles. Pick them up for recycling. But beware of traffic, the shoulder, freaky chickens crossing 
the road, and holes on the road. Every time you're involved in an accident your life-energy 
decreases, but you can fill it up by collecting soft drink bottles thrown away by other drivers. At 
the end of each stage stands an recycling container, on the down-right side of the screen you get the 
information how many miles left to it. If you reach the containers you automatically fill it with all 
the bottles you picked up during the stage. For each of them you get bonus points. For filling up 
life-energy you receive the information when a car drives by the driver drinking a soft drink. Get 
close to the car and to approx. the same speed - and your guy drinks automatically from the soft 
drink. It's a good choice to drive most times in the mid of the highway - you never know when freaky 
high speed-racers come up to you.

Dakota. The best aircrews from around the world and some of the best aircraft come to participate in 
a series of three missions that are constantly monitored, with points awarded to aircrews in various 
categories. In the end, the aircrew that has gained the post points receives the Curtis E. LeMay 
trophy. In this game, you are the pilot of one of these aircrews with a choice of flying one of six 
aircraft, and your missions will pit you against any of seven additional enemy aircraft (although you 
will not get to fly them). To practice flying, you can do a Free Flight

Strike Force Harrier (7491) (c) 1986 H&H&nbsp / Mirrorsoft Ltd. 
 
Rod Hyde was always determined to produce the most realistic and advanced flight simulations ever, 
and this early attempt at recreating the Harrier is an example of that. There are 3 skill levels, as 
well as two practice modes - one for the rudiments of flight and the other for combat. The 
action-centered nature of the title means that it can be seen as an advanced shoot 'em up rather than 
a pukka flight simulator. 
 
Acquiring a lock on enemy planes and tanks is made easier by the advanced targeting technology of the 
planes, and escaping enemy fire is aided by the vectored thrust system. Shooting out the tanks clears 
ground space to set up your own bases, which must then be defended. VTOL (vertical take-off and 
landing) is correctly implemented, although more traditional horizontal take-offs should be used when 
space permits. The full range of weapons are provided

In Mr. Angry, you play a photographer who photographs women for his own enjoyment. The object of the 
game is to search behind doors for four items: a pass, a key, a camera, and a lightbulb for the 
camera. Once you acquire these, open the door at the farthest left and photograph a woman who tries 
to look pretty by crossing her legs every five seconds. 
 
But there's a catch: stopping you from completing your tasks is the hotel inspector, manager, and one 
of the bar patrons. Furthermore, if you open enough doors to find the items you need, chances are you 
wake Mr. Angry up, and he'll stop at nothing to make your job harder. More often than not, an item of 
yours will be behind his door. 
 
There are 10 screens (or floors) to complete. After 10 screens, the difficulty level gets higher, and 
new characters start to appear like the chef and the security guard, which makes Mr. Angry even more 
fun. You also have a deadline in which you have to get everything by. If you fail to meet that 
deadline, you lose a life. As usual, lose all your lives and the game is over. 
 
Certain doors are hard to get to unless you use elevators. Your enemies are smart enough to know how 
to use them, and they can catch you even when you are on these elevators. However, the only thing 
that they can't use is the conveyor belts on Screens 9 and 10.

Based on the 1989 Atari Games (not to be confused with Atari Corporation, producers of the Lynx) 
coin-op by Ed Rotberg.  It's 2492 and you must pilot your Sub-Terranean Underground Network 
(S.T.U.N.) craft at speeds over 900 miles per hour through a series of courses to retain your title 
as S.T.U.N. Runner, completing each course before time runs out. 
 
There are also enemies on each course, such as cycles, indestructible armored drones, and flying 
bird-like craft.  Shoot or avoid them.  If you hit them, you lose one of your shields (your craft has 
six total) and are slowed down temporarily.  The more shields you have at the finish line, the more 
bonus points you get.  Getting hit with no shields does not kill you, however.  There are no lives in 
this game.  The only way to lose is to fail to cross the finish line. 
 
Along the way you'll encounter Boost Pads that temporarily speed you up to incredible speeds and make 
you indestructible.  By running over enough green stars on each course, you can also earn Shockwaves, 
which destroy all enemies in your path. 
 
Note that there is no accelerator in this game.  Your craft always goes full speed, unless you hit 
something.  Then you will slow down, but quickly accelerate back to full speed.  Other than that, you 
cannot slow down and the only way to speed up is to run over a Boost Pad.  Your only controls are 
steering left and right and aiming the gun on top of your craft up and down.

bullets that travel forward, or tossing bombs that fly directly upwards and then fall (there's a

items to collect. At the end of each level, Seymour fights a giant boss that jumps around and tosses

Subbuteo recreates the famous table football game, which makes for something very different from 
Sensible/Kick Off/FIFA style games. It's effectively a turn-based strategy game of sorts, as each 
player has 30 seconds to make their move (within a 30 minute match length), which involves first 
selecting a player, then aiming the direction in which he will be flicked, then the power and swerve 
of the flick are determined by the length of time the button is held down for. 
 
With any luck, your player will hit the ball, and hit it such that it doesn't leave the playing area, 
and doesn't hit an opponent. If any of those rules are violated, possession passes to the opposition. 
Before each flick, the team not in possession can make a 'defensive flick' involving moving one of 
their players into a potential blocking position (without hitting the ball or an opponent, as this is 
a foul).

represent, and then takes turns competing in various events to see who will win the gold medal! The 
game allows you to compete in all of the events sequentially, choose a few events, choose just one 
event, or practice an event. The events available vary slightly depending on the platform, and may 
include: 
 
1. Pole vault 
2. Platform diving 
3. 4x400 meter relay 
4. 100 meter dash 
5. Gymnastics 
6. Freestyle swimming 
7. Skeet shooting

Summer Games II (7547) (c) 1985 Epyx, Inc. / U.S. Gold Ltd. 
 
Eight Olympic events feature in this game, and any selection of these can be played at a time. There 
is no pure sprinting, and only the rowing and cycling can be thought of as pure joystick-waggling. 
The triple jump involves pressing right to start the hop (before reaching the white line), right 
again for the step as you land, left as you land for the jump, and then up to propel you through the 
sand.  I high jump, after selecting a height you feel you can clear, you use up and down to control 
the speed, fire to jump, and then forward to propel you over the bar. 
 
For the javelin even you hold down fire to build up speed, and push left to throw the javelin, 
holding it left before releasing to change the angle. In the equestrian event, you must use up to 
increase speed, and fire or right to jump when appropriate to clear the hazards - too many faults 
will see you disqualified. 
 
Fencing involves moving your foil using the joystick, always staying one step ahead of your opponent, 
retreating when appropriate. The kayaking event involves navigating a river by controlling the 
direction, ensuring that all the gates are past correctly even when this requires some precise lining 
up. You can also load the events from Summer Games 1 in, to play all 16 events in a marathon session.

Sunburst (7554) (c) 1988 Hewson Consultants Ltd. / Hewson Consultants Ltd. 
 
Sunburst is a top-down, multiscrolling shooter in which players take control of a space ship and 
travel through several sun systems, dodging or shooting asteroids and enemies. Enemies emerge from 
circles that can be found in every system. Colliding with these enemies damages or immediately 
destroys the ship. Destroyed enemies randomly drop energy pods that remain intact for 10 seconds. 
Collecting energy pods increases an energy bar shown on the lower left side of the screen. Once it is 
at maximum, the ship can be flown into the sun to reach the next system.

Superbike Challenge brings 1000cc motorbikes to life for a one or two player race. Unusually, the 
screen is split horizontally, with your action only ever using half of the screen. You can play a 
full season of races, or run at one of the 12 tracks as a stand-alone race (including Assen, Mugello, 
the old Hockenheim and Spa). A manual gearbox option and 3 skill levels ensure that you can't master 
the game immediately. Full information on your speed and revs, the race order and course layout are 
on screen at all times. 
 
Superbike Challenge is an updated version of Grand Prix 500 cc, with a better menu and title screen

Super Bowl XX (7563) (c) 1986 Ocean Software Ltd. / Ocean Software Ltd. 
 
Super Bowl XX, in which Chicago trounced New England 46-10, is recreated in this action/strategy 
hybrid, which also features computer AI for a solo match on the C64 version (Spectrum owners can only 
practice plays on their own). When kicking, the player controls the kick's strength and accuracy by 
pressing fire, so the direction isn't under direct control, and punts can only be returned if they 
are caught on the full. 
 
When selecting the play, a distinction is made between long and short passing plays. You select the 
recipient when the ball is in play by moving the cursor which appears and pressing fire. If a catch 
is made, you can take control of any player, which needn't be the player running for the end-zone. 
Running and Special Teams plays are also on offer of course. 
 
When on the defense, the player has 4 main positional strategies to choose from, and can specify 
individual markers, and a player to simply track the ball carrier. Any individual player can be 
controlled once the action begins, and holding down fire allows you to change this player as the play 
unfolds.

A simple action game where you play a rabbit who must cross the screen initially from left to right 
avoiding the various nasty critters in your way. 
 
When you reach the right hand side of the screen your goal is to claim the carrot that is being 
dangled in front of you. If you get the carrot you are transformed into Super Bunny and must begin 
your journey back across the screen. In your super powered form you can take revenge and defeat the 
critters standing in your way. 
 
Super Bunny is similar to "cross the road" games such as the arcade game Frogger and Activision's 
Freeway. 
 
The original box came with a complete "Super Bunny" comic book written and illustrated by air-brush

There are 9 tracks at each of the 4 difficulty levels, which can be raced in any order (although the 
last track you race is made harder than usual). In the races you win money, which can be spent on the 
usual handling and power upgrades, as well as forward-shooting missiles. You must finish in the top 3 
of each race to progress - initially there are 4 computer opponents, but more are added as you 
progress through the game 
 
You can upgrade your car throughout the game via the shop section. You are given an initial price, 
but also a number of options of things to say to the salesman – get the right combination and the 
price will drop.

divided by a set number, bigger on lower levels). Your bike has 3 gears and appears to have a top 
speed of around 120 MPH. After every 2 races there's a bonus round in which you must pick up as many

Super Dragon Slayer (7575) (c) 1988 Codemasters / Codemasters 
 
What does a brave magician do when the princess gets kidnapped? Well usually nothing since we have 
brave knights to save her, but not this time. The mighty dragon is holding a princess captive in his 
lair and our brave magician must rescue her by battling hordes of evil minions in 4 levels of this 
almost forgotten game. 
 
The gameplay is a classical side-scrolling shoot 'em up. The enemies come in pre-determined patterns 
and never attack you directly. They are just there for you to avoid or shoot at. 
 
Shooting enemies gives you points but also builds up your magic points. When you collect enough magic 
points you'll get a spell to cast. These spell are really useful and quite fun to use. There is a 
bomb spell that kills everything on the screen and "frog" spell that lets you jump a large holes. 
Some spells change depending on the level of the game you're playing. 
 
Speaking of holes, you must remember that in this game holes are your biggest enemies. Most of the 
time the trick is finding a right place to jump from. You only have one life, you can get a extra 
life when you kill enough enemies, but one wrong step and you're in the hole and you're dead. Extra 
life doesn't count for holes.

Each continent is a different difficulty level: Africa is beginner, Asia is junior, the Americas are 
senior, and Europe is expert. 
 
This is a very simple and straightforward game, viewed from behind the bike in 2D (so the screen does 
not tilt with the bike). The right/left controls are steering, and up/down are gear changes. Your 
cycle is always moving, and your speed strictly depends on the gear you are in, although contact or 
running off the road slows the bike down.

Super Pac-Man (7598) (c) 1988 Namco Limited / Beam Software Pty., Ltd. 
 
Super Pac-Man is just another game from Namco's   Pac-Man family, but instead of gobbling up dots, 
Pac is required to eat fruit and prizes, such as apples, bunches of bananas, doughnuts, hamburgers, 
fried eggs, ears of corn, sneakers, pieces of cakes, raspberries, limes, cups of coffee, mushrooms, 
Galaxians, bells and shamrocks. Most of these items are hidden in passages that have locked doors at 
either entrance, and in order to unlock the doors, Pac needs to eat the key that is closest to the 
passage that he wishes to unlock. As usual, ghosts will keep chasing Pac around the maze until he has 
lost all his lives. However, Pac can enter the warp tunnels at either side of the maze to lose the 
ghosts quickly. 
 
There are two types of power pellets in the maze: green and yellow. Yellow power pellets cause ghosts 
to turn blue, allowing Pac to eat them for points, whereas green ones cause Pac to enlarge and will 
also cause the ghosts to become much thinner and wider, allowing him to fly over them. He can also 
break open the doors without the need of keys. The effects of the pellets, unfortunately, only lasts 
for  a number of seconds. During the time that he is enlarged, a flashing star will appear besides 
two boxes that are located in the middle of the maze. The first box will display the current fruit or 
prize, and the other will display a rotating selection of them. If Pac manages to eat the star when 
they match, there will be a large bonus score. 
 
Occasionally, after three or more stages, there will be a bonus stage where Pac automatically gets 
enlarged. The object of these stages is to eat everything in the maze before the time runs out, and 
during these stages, there will be no ghosts to pursue him.

board, suggest the identity of the person, place, thing, event, phrase, etc., that is the Super 
Password. 
 
Each game consists of three to four rounds. The first round is worth $100, the second $200, the third 
$300, and the fourth (if necessary) $400. The first player to win $500 (or more) wins the game. The 
winner gets to play the Final Round for $10,000. To play the Final Round, the winning player must 
guess the ten Passwords as each one's initial letter is highlighted at the bottom of the stand. Each 
word is worth $100, but a special bonus of $10,000 is awarded if all ten are guessed.

The follow-up to Super Pipeline adds new enemies and 16 levels. The player controlled the 
(white-suited) foreman in charge of keeping the pipeline flowing to fill a number of barrels (which 
increased on later levels, up to 3). Two types of enemy run onto the pipe - those that can make a 
hole (commonly drills, a blowtorch and the earthenware jug) and pests (spiders, lobsters and so on). 
Once a hole is made in the pipe, the foreman must guide a (green-suited) workman to the hole so it 
can be repaired. While the workman is mending the leak, he is vulnerable to being knocked off the 
pipe. 
 
The foreman is equipped with a gun to shoot enemies, but he can also be knocked off the pipe by the 
monsters. To make matters more complicated, the lobster can only be attacked from behind (due to its 
shell) and the "Shower of Tacks" on later levels cannot be shot at all.

Gameplay is flick-screen and platform-based. Spiders and guards' darts must be avoided - contact with 
these drains your energy from its initial 99, as does falling any distance, although health tablets 
can be collected. Hearts must be collected from each screen, as must keys to operate the medieval

the Kikstart TV show and games. The basic aim is to ride a motocross bike through hazardous courses 
within the time limits. 
 
The game uses a split-screen display, with a big window viewed from the side as well as a 
longer-range aerial view - the latter is useful for dodging hazards to the left or right, as the 
side-view doesn't demonstrate these accurately. The bike has 3 gears, and you must use a low gear to 
go uphill. You will need to do wheelies to ensure good landings from the big jumps, and to clear 
divots in the ground.

Super Seymour (7610) (c) 1992 Big Red Software / Codemasters 
 
In the sequel to Seymour Goes to Hollywood, Seymour takes on his first movie role - as an 
eco-friendly superhero. With game design showing some obvious influence from Bomb Jack, Seymour jumps 
around a series of single screen areas collecting barrels of toxic waste. One barrel at a time is 
highlighted and is worth more points than the others, but will explode after a short countdown. 
Seymour is plagued by mutants which fly and bounce around the screen. Some must be jumped on from 
above, some must be hit from below.

A conversion of the arcade game, Super Sprint is a racing game for one or two players. Gameplay is 
from an overhead view of the racetrack. The racetracks start simple and gradually get more 
complicated, and may also feature obstacles ranging from traffic cones to tornadoes. Occasionally 
wrenches will appear in the roadway, and when collected they can be used after a race to power up 
your car with better tires, better acceleration or a higher top speed.

In Superstar Ice Hockey you control one of 20 NHL teams. The game has no license so you can't play 
with the stars. There are 4 groups with 5 teams. After the regular season the best 2 teams of every 
group are qualified for the playoffs. Worth mentioning is that you are playing always the center - 
the other players are controlled by the CPU. In the multiplayer mode you can only play friendly

Indoor Sports (3750) (c) 1987 DesignStar Consultants, Inc. / Mindscape, Inc. 
 
Four Indoor Sports are compiled in this entry to DesignStar's SportTime line of recreations. Ten-Pin 
Bowling, Air Hockey, Darts and (except on the Commodore 64) Ping Pong are featured. The menus and 
options screens have the same feel as Clubhouse Sports. Each game has computer opponents at multiple 
skill levels plus human-versus-human and demo modes, and matches can consist of varying numbers of 
rounds, with other options depending on the game. 
 
Ten-pin bowling is played from a side-on view, although once the shot has been taken you see the 
   results unfold from the bowler's view. There are three stages to taking a shot. Move the player up 
   and down to line up his run-up, pressing fire to set the position. Then, do the same to set the 
   angle of the shot. Finally, after pressing fire to start the run-up, press it again to time the 
   release of the ball, as close to the line as possible. 
 
Darts has 4 skill and 3 speed levels, and players can play to 301, 501 or 701, to vary game length or 
provide a handicapping system. You can also set whether scoring must start or end with a double. 
Viewed from behind the board, you must first line up the dart, then set the dart's curvature and 
power by stopping a curved gauge on the right, then a rising power bar on the left. The view then 
changes twice - first a behind-the-player view to show the dart's approach, then a close-up of the 
board to show where it landed. 
 
Air Hockey plays for five minutes, or until someone has scored 12 points. The view is above the pitch 
but angled so as to emphasize the goal at the top. 
 
Ping-Pong features a handicapping system - six ability areas can be graded from 1-5, to ensure a 
closely-matched game. Again the view is from behind one court. To impart direction onto a shot, the 
angle must be pressed at the same time as the fire button.

Superstar Ping-Pong (7665) (c) 1986 DesignStar Consultants, Inc. / U.S. Gold Ltd. 
 
This is a table-tennis game where one player can play against the computer or two players play 
against each other. It looks similar to Imagine's Ping Pong but offers more gameplay options. The 
table is displayed in 3D and you only see the bat (no player or your hand). You can choose if the net 
will be split horizontally or vertically. Hitting the ball is pretty simple, just press the fire 
button when the ball comes close to your bat. Depending on if you hit the ball to early or too late 
it returns in different angles. 
 
While the program is loading, you have a menu where you can choose several game options like bat 
control (computer-guided or manual - beginners should start with computer-guided), game speed and if 
you want to change the sides of the table after each player has served. The most-interesting option 
is that you can give up to 20 skill points to 6 different hitting-options (like forehand, backhand, 
smash etc.). Normally the program automatically gives you 12 points overall (2 for each of the 6 
hitting options) but you can change this the way you want to have it up to the max of 20 points. So 
you're able to increase or decrease your skills for your forehand, backhand and smashing abilities 
and the way you personally prefer your table-tennis gameplay. 
 
Rules are official table-tennis rules in the 80's, first player reaching 21 points wins the game/set 
(option setting allows you to play 1, 2, 3 or even more sets for an match). After choosing your side 
on the table, and the color of your bat the action begins.

Superstar Soccer (7667) (c) 1987 SportTime / Mindscape, Inc. 
 
Much of the design and programming of Superstar Ice Hockey (by many of the same programmers) is 
revised to provide a six-a-side soccer game. You can control any combination of centre-forward, 
goalkeeper (on the C64) and manager. For much of the game you are merely the centre-forward as the 
action unfolds around you - don't be afraid to track back and help out. 
 
The ball sticks closely to a player, who can pass, shoot, head or bicycle-kick it. Goalkeepers are 
penalised for retaining possession for too long (a rule later adapted for use in real-life football). 
Match length can be between 6 and 90 minutes, by toggling the speed at which time moves. Fouls are 
fully implemented. 
 
Single matches can be played in the cassette version, but the disk version adds a full-season 
structure. 64 English teams are split into 4 divisions of 16, with a season consisting of either 7 or 
15 matches.

The scenes include desert chases, forest rallying and Grand Canyon jumps. There are 7 levels in

down. 
 
Unusually, you get bonuses for crashing anything up to twice (as this can be perceived to maximize

Super Tank Simulator (7625) (c) 1990 Optimus Software Ltd / Codemasters 
 
8 challenging zones of battle await you in your role as a tank driver. The game is viewed from above, 
with rotational control and forward/reverse power for the tank. The routes to travel along are narrow 
and varied, so some exploration is required – some paths are inevitably safer and faster than others. 
The walls are particularly useful as they are strong enough to deflect shots, so you can often attack 
from safe positions round a corner. 
 
Opposition includes gun turrets firing at you, enemy tanks and landmines. You start with a standard 
gun, which must be held down longer to take out tougher foes, but can collect smart bombs and 
shields. A first-person viewpoint section follows each of these sections, with the sighting under 
your control, and more helicopters and jeeps to take on.

shelves, then move it to the appropriate part of the supermarket. Over 30 foods are featured, ranging 
from bread and milk to eggs and carrots. Each section of the supermarket has its own 
isometrically-viewed screen. The shoppers are there to get in your way, and other hazards include 
vandalising kids, un-house-trained dogs and moronic shoppers who don't take their item off the top of 
the shelves. The ultimate aim of the game is to do so well that you can take over as manager.

Every track features hazards, like ups and downs which limit your visibility, roadworks reducing the 
road to a single line, and the many other participant trucks. At the end of every track the road 
forks and the player can choose the next stage in their route. This feature, taken from Sega's 
"OutRun", makes every trip a new challenge.

Super Zaxxon (13058) (c) 1984 SEGA Enterprises, Inc. / SEGA Enterprises, Inc. 
 
Super Zaxxon is a three-quarter perspective, space shooter style game. You must first go over a base 
on an asteroid. Things located on this base include gun implacements, fuel tanks, radar stations, 
missiles, and fighters. After you successfully navigate this base, you will go through a tunnel to 
tangle with enemy fighters, mine layers, and mines. You then will have to navigate through a series 
of barriers on another asteroid in order to take on the Super Zaxxon's, the enemy robot dragons. 
 
The game is very similar in appearance to Zaxxon.  The differences are: 
 
1. Your fighter moves much faster. This makes going after ground targets a big challenge. 
 
2. The graphics are different. Although this is more of a viewing difference, it can still change 
   ones perspective after they have gotten used to the Zaxxon graphics. 
 
3. There is no more outer space battle. Instead, you must go through a narrow tunnel to get to 
   area 3. 
 
4. Instead of 20 fighters, you now have to tangle with 25 fighters in area 2. 
 
5. A new enemy, the Mine Layer, is introduced. As the name implies, this ship lays mines in your 
   path. You can destroy the mines but it takes a few hits. 
 
6. Instead of encountering one Zaxxon robot, you now have to deal with three Super Zaxxon, dragon 
   looking robots. 
 
7. The placement of things (fuel tanks, gun implacements, etc.) in areas 1 and 3 is different then 
   in Zaxxon. 
 
8. There are now indestructible, elevated guns in area 1. These guns sit on the right side and 
   they are 2.5 units in altitude.

Almost a thousand people have been trapped in a hibernation dome after a nuclear war. The player 
takes control over three droids and must use their abilities to rescue the survivors. 
 
Seen from a top-down perspective, The Survivors plays somewhat similar to Boulder Dash as the levels 
are filled with sand and rocks. Droid 1 is the only droid that can dig through the earth, Droid 2 can 
beam survivors to safety (by moving over them) and Droid 3 can push rocks (only one at a time). The 
goal in each of the seven levels is to rescue all survivors within the time limit, while paying 
attention not to trap or damage any of the droids. Removing sand or pushing around rocks might cause 
other rocks to fall down and crash the droids. There are also Guardian Droids whose circuits have 
been damaged by the nuclear fall-out, causing them to run rampant. They damage the players droids on 
contact.

Shape of tiles varies from big and small squares to triangles or hexagons. If tiles have no neighbor 
tiles you may take appropriate tiles from the pocket of the limited size to eliminate the rest of the 
tiles. Finishing the level, player will be transferred to the higher level if the results of the 
current level were high enough for such level. But to finish level successfully, player should 
acquire the certain number of points and to be qualified for the next level. The difficulty also 
raises and depends on quantity of colours, the shape of the tiles, and time limit presence. Undo 
moves are also present, but such moves decrease your final results. Game may be saved in progress and 
loaded later. 
 
Best scores and levels will be written in High Score Table.

Sweet Sixteen (7692) (c) May 26, 1986 
 
A nasty piece of work, the player here controls the actions of a "player" -- a love-'em-and-leave-'em 
high school Lothario at Kenwood Academy who takes on a bet from his neanderthal friends of Chicago's 
Hyde Park area to seduce Nova Tilland, a stunningly gorgeous transfer student from Lab School... and 
to produce proof.  A $500 wager hangs in the balance. 
 
Taking advantage of her good nature, the player confabulates a sob story about having a vehicular 
breakdown in front of her house.  She lets the player in to use the phone, through which his 
co-conspirators arrange for a tow truck to arrive in four hours, granting the player a window of 
opportunity to realise the dirty deed. 
 
Given free rein to wander the house, the player must rustle up some means of documenting their 
conquest and come up with a scheme by which to distract Nova's father, a dangerous opponent 
personified in-game as an avid subscriber to "Sniper, the Magazine for Gunmen".  That done, only 
navigation of an unlit area and the obligatory secret passage interfere with access to the squalid 
endgame, an unfortunate ends-justify-the-means exercise in bondage and coercion in a basement 
dungeon.

Swiss Family Robinson is a computer game based on the 1812 novel by Johann David Wyss. Players take 
the role of Fritz, the eldest brother of a Swiss family that has been shipwrecked in the oceans of 
the East Indies en route to Port Jackson, Australia. 
 
As the game begins, it is your goal to find a way off of the ship, onto the deserted island, and 
build a shelter to survive.  Numerous challenges await Fritz as he has to defend against tropical 
storms, hostile animals, and the mischievous antics of his youngest brother Francis, which can 
sometimes hinder the player's progress. 
 
Swiss Family Robinson is a classic-style text adventure game, using basic word commands and phrases 
to talk to your family, take action, or accomplish goals.  As with most games of the the time, you 
have to explore the details of the scenery in order to find clues and items that will aid your 
survival. 
 
There are some "help" features in the game to give a player additional info. such as a "Help" key, a 
mapping/navigation system, and an actual "Guide to Nature" book that contains detailed information on 
island flora and fauna, as well as basic survival skills.

One player controlled a helicopter and the other a jeep, with the jeep transforming into a boat when 
the vehicles passed over water. As well as a host of blaster fodder the game also included a 
mid-level enemy inspired by the "Goose" enemy from the earlier title Silkworm. Pieces of this enemy 
would fly onto the screen and assemble into one vehicle before commencing to fire at the players' 
vehicles. When destroyed the "goose" would drop power-ups.

Sword of Fargoal, The (7702) (c) 1983 Epyx, Inc. / Epyx, Inc. 
 
The Protectorate Sword which was forged to vanquish evil has been stolen by a powerful wizard named 
Ulma and placed deep in an underground dungeon.  Only when this sword is retrieved and given to 
Gedwyn the blinded hero, will Ulma be destroyed forever. 
 
A Rogue-style game released in the same year, with the difference being that the game is presented 
graphically, not with ASCII characters. The player will travel through a multi-level dungeon complete 
with treasures and traps that are randomly generated each time the game is played.  Once your 
character is generated you will hack and slash your way through ogres, hobgoblins, and many other 
monsters in the hopes of eventually reaching the level where the sword is hidden. 
 
The game does not end when the sword is in hand, the player must also escape the dungeon before it is 
destroyed by Ulma - you have 2000 seconds to do this.

A side scrolling shooter in which you fly a spaceship through futuristic environments and must

and a radar at the top of the screen shows the enemies' position. Carefully adjust your ship's speed 
to keep up with the enemies without crashing into them. Colliding with enemy ships or getting hit by 
enemy fire decreases your ship's energy bar. At the end of each level, you get the chance to destroy 
a large mothership for bonus points. Getting hit by a mothership does not damage your ship, but 
throws you into the next stage without bonus. As the game progresses, new enemy formations attack 
you, standard enemies become more numerous and faster, while motherships get bigger and carry more 
weapons.

This game consists of two parts which can be played independently, all of being related to aim 
shooting. The second part does include a 1 or 2 players mode. 
 
In the first part you will have to shot at plates flying in the air, accounting for a total of 12, if 
you hit at least 6 the you will pass to the next round of this first part. You have 3 shots for every 
two plates, so you have to be effective on a regular basis. Once you have passed this round, you will 
have to aim at a total of 7 targets, your goal is to hit at least 3 of them, here you only have one 
shot available for each objective. If you are lucky enough, the stage will be restarted with 
increased difficulty. 
 
In the second part of the game your objective will be to protect a juicy cooked chicken to be 
mercilessly attacked by spiders or voracious wasps that emerge from everywhere. Your mission would be 
to shot at them before they can absorb its substance till just leaving the bones. But it will not be 
easy, as time goes on insects will be more numerous, so if you find it pertinent, you can request the 
help from a second player. Do not let them spoil your dish...

Tarzan (7773) (c) 1986 Martech / Martech 
 
According to African legend, a human baby was abandoned in the forest. Found and brought up by a 
she-ape named Kala, he grew to learn the ways of the jungle and the language of the beasts. Years 
later, as John Clayton, Lord of Greystoke, he was brought back to England to claim his rightful 
inheritance. However, he occasionally returns to the wild to become Tarzan, Lord of the Jungle. 
 
Now is one of those occasions. Tarzan has returned to the jungle with his wife, Lady Jane Greystoke, 
but their holiday came to an end when Usanga, evil chief of the Wamabo, kidnaps Jane to force Tarzan 
into retrieving the seven gemstones that were stolen from his tribal shrine. These gemstones are 
believed to be the Eyes of the Rainbow, representing each color of the spectrum. Tarzan has been 
given three days to find the gemstones, otherwise Jane will be eaten by the tribal pet, Sheeta the 
Panther. 
 
After consulting his information sources, Tarzan learns that the Eyes of the Rainbow have been 
scattered around the dense jungle by a family of pesky chimps. Tarzan's quest involves navigating 
dark caves, crevasses, swamps, and treacherous quicksand. 
 
Objects, such as the rope and torch, need to be found if Tarzan wants to find each gemstone. 
Throughout the quest, hazards such asheadhunters, lions, snakes, spiders, quicksands, and pits are 
encountered. If Tarzan comes into contact with any of these hazards, he becomes stunned for an hour 
and the on-screen timer shrinks accordingly. Fortunately, he can punch creatures, allowing him to 
escape them. 
 
If Tarzan manages to find all seven gemstones within the time limit and deliver them to Usanga, Jane 
will be released. If not, she will become nothing more than another bowl of jungle soup.

A prince has laid eyes on Princess Kelly, but her father, King Otto, is convinced that he is not 
worthy enough of marrying her. To prove him wrong, King Otto sets the prince a series of seven tasks 
that he needs to accomplish if he is to win her hand in marriage: 
 
1. The prince has to survive a night outside the castle. When the sun sets behind the hills, 
   hordes of mortified-looking zombies appear from both sides of the screen, and in order not to be 
   eaten, the prince must shoot them with his arrows until the sun rises. 
 
2. The prince has been placed somewhere in Dabbit Wood where an evil wizard materializes, fires at 
   him, then dematerializes. With little time in between, he must shoot the wizard the moment the 
   wizard appears. 
 
3. Four sacred stones need to be recovered from Vampire Mountain. Bats will come out from a cave 
   and fly around the prince in an attempt to stop him from completing his task. 
 
4. Devil Worshipers from the Temple of Demons have been sent to Stonehenge to wipe out the prince. 
   These worshipers have the ability to fire in all directions. The prince can claim victory if he 
   kills a certain amount of monks. 
 
5. The ancient spirit stone of the Runes of Tygorth is freeing dangerous spirits, and needs to be 
   destroyed. The stone will take a few hits by the prince, giving time for the spirits to fire at 
   the prince if he gets too close to it. 
 
6. Ritual stones have been placed in the village of the Northern Barbarians and the prince has the 
   task of retrieving five right ones. Meanwhile, vicious barbarians emerge from the cottage and try 
   to stop the prince from stealing them. 
 
7. The prince is so close to marrying his love. All he needs to do is to get to the wedding 
   ceremony, held at the Castle of the Birdmen – aptly named because aggressive birds will appear who 
   will swoop down and fire at the prince before he has the chance to get inside. 
 
If the prince successfully completes all of these tasks, then King Otto will let her daughter be his 
wife. If he fails, King Otto will not agree to the marriage until all tasks are accomplished.

Tazz (7785) (c) 1984 Bubble Bus Software / Bubble Bus Software 
 
Players control Tazzman, a yellow, fun-loving dude who must navigating from room to room shooting 
bugs with his laser gun. Tazzman can only stand still and shoot in four directions, but cannot shoot 
while moving. Several hazards prevent Tazz from achieving his goal. Two nasties pursue Tazz, but he 
is supplied with bombs that he can use to wipe them out, as well as stop the walls from closing in on 
him. Once Tazz has killed all bugs on the screen, the left and right exits will open up, allowing him 
to escape into the next room before he is crushed. Every two rooms there is a bonus room which allows 
Tazz to collect all the numbers, obtain more bombs, and leave through either side.

T-Bird (7724) (c) 1989 PAL Developments / Virgin Mastertronic Ltd. 
 
Players control a Foourd T-Bird, a transportation system capable of great speeds up to 1346 mph. 
Their job is to destroy the swarms of aliens – including flying saucers, tie fighters, space 
jellyfish, unidentifiable blobs, and the like – and dodge their fire. This can be achieved by 
shooting them with the standard zapper or use a smart missile to destroy everything in sight. 
 
When an entire swarm is destroyed, getting the token that appears give the player a roving sight, 
sideways-firing missiles, extra lives, extra missiles, and so on. Between each swarm, a meteor shower 
appears, and players need to avoid being hit. At the end of each level, players have to destroy a 
guardian to proceed to the next, and the smart missiles cannot be used to destroy them.

Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles (11027) (c) 1990 Konami Industry Co. Ltd. / Ultra Software Corporation 
 
With April O'Neil held hostage by The Shredder's thugs, Bebop and Rocksteady, once again, it's up to 
the Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles to come to her rescue!  Play as all four of the turtle heroes, 
rescue April, and then rescue your sensei Splinter from Mecha-Turtles clutches than go after The 
Shredder deep in the bowels of The Technodrome itself. 
 
Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles is an action game based on the late eighties/early nineties cartoon 
series of the same name. Play as Leonardo, Michaelangelo, Donatello and Raphael (one turtle only, but 
the ability to swap between turtles at any time) as you save your friends and battle The Shredder and 
his cronies. There are no 'lives', as such - when you lose a turtle, he becomes 'captured', and you 
cannot use him again until you rescue him from a place hidden in the overworld. 
 
Gameplay takes place in two perspectives: a top-down view, which lets you run around and explore 
buildings, sewers and other places. When entering places from the top-down view, the perspective 
shifts to a side-scrolling view, where most of the battling takes place. In addition to each turtle's 
main weapon, sub-weapons (such as shuriken) can be acquired, to use at foes - these have a limited 
use.

Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles - The Arcade Game (17811) (c) 1991 Konami Co., Ltd. / Image Works 
 
April O'Neil, the reporter friend of the Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles, is kidnapped by the villainous 
Shredder and his two goons, Bebop and Rocksteady. The four ninja turtles: Raphael, Michelangelo, 
Donatello and Leonardo fight their way through hordes of Foot Soldiers in order to rescue April. They 
battle familiar foes such as the mad scientist Baxter Stockman, General Traag from Dimension X and 
the evil alien brain Krang, up to the final showdown with Shredder himself. 
 
Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles: The Arcade Game is a port of the popular arcade game made by Konami 
during the height of the cartoon series' popularity. Depending on the version of the game, up to two, 
three or four players can take part in the action. The game plays like a simplified Double Dragon. 
While most of the standard Foot Soldier enemies are easily dispatched, some attack with knives or ray 
guns and are thus more dangerous. At the end of each level, players encounter a boss (or in certain 
cases two bosses working in tandem, such as Bebop and Rocksteady). 
 
The NES version of the game features additional content not present in other versions of the game: 
two new levels (Snowy Central Park and The Dojo), new bosses (including Tora, Shogun and Baxter 
Stockman as a fly), additional music tracks as well as more variations of Foot Soldiers.

Temple of Terror (7812) (c) 1987 Adventuresoft UK Ltd. / Adventuresoft UK Ltd. 
 
You are a solitary adventurer, chosen by the sage Yaztromo to save the land of Allansia from 
Malbordus, the sinister champion of the Dark Elves, by beating him through the inhospitable wastes of 
the Desert of Skulls to the fabulous lost city of Vatos.  There you must brave cruel monsters, 
ancient deathtraps, fanatical disciples of the cult of Leesha, and the cat-and-mouse depredations of 
the sinister killer known as the Messenger of Death in your quest to recover the powerful Dragon 
artefacts before Malbordus can find them and utilise their mystical power to fuel his campaign of 
carnage. 
 
A loose adaptation (using many of the original's characters, locations, situations and puzzles but 
often in new configurations) of Ian Livingstone's Fighting Fantasy gamebook #14, published two years 
prior, this computer game version merges the gamebook's Choose-Your-Own-Adventure design to the 
Adventure International text-game-with-graphics model developer Adventure Soft had grown familiar 
with republishing.  This curious hybrid yields some alternate puzzle solutions that wouldn't have 
been possible in the original gamebook format, but often imposes extraneous constraints such as carry 
limits and step-by-step sequences of actions that the book would have effortlessly bundled together 
in a single multiple-choice paragraph selection.  Curiously, considering the ease with which 
computers automate data management, the designers chose to reject the trademark Fighting Fantasy 
SKILL, STAMINA, LUCK RPG stats-management -- distancing the conversion from unfair elements of 
randomness but placing a new emphasis on adventure game inventory puzzles. 
 
A version of this game also came out for the BBC Micro.

Ten Little Indians (7817) (c) 1984 
 
Number 10 in the Mysterious Adventures series of interactive fiction is inspired by the Agatha 
Christie book "And Then There were None". The player's aim is to find the gold statue, formed by 
Major Johnstone-Smythe from most of his assets shortly before his death. The Major also made 10 
worthless copies in various colours, and hid them in and around his mansion. Only the 10 'little 
indian' figurines, assembled together, would reveal the location of the final golden one. These 
figurines are hidden behind and under ordinary household objects, and in various hiding places. 
 
Around this time, Scott Adams' game engine was redone to allow complete sentences instead of the more 
primitive 2-word input that had been used previously. Brian Howarth gained the chance to use this in 
the Mysterious Adventures games, although early versions of the game may have still used the cruder 
parser.

Mining Engineers working on the planet Krion have inadvertently triggered its destruction, and must 
escape in this vertically-scrolling shoot 'em up. There are over 100 screens to fly through, and they 
include many barriers and narrow paths, as well as force fields. There are also time-shift fields - 
some move you forward, but some send you back to the start. 
 
Enemies are in short supply - the game's feel resembles Artificial Dreams (from the same designer). 
You have limited fuel and must collect fuel tokens to recharge this. Other available powerups include 
points bonuses, extra lives, changes to the constant speed of scrolling, and invincibility from force 
fields (although not enemies).

the bulls and sharks, take care to avoid heatstroke, and make sure your family doesn't run off. 
 
Getting there and simply surviving all the hazards the brochure 'forgot' to mention is a challenge in 
itself, but you must also take 10 holiday snaps to prove what you got up to. 
 
The game is structured similarly to a real holiday. There are day trips to go on, which provide extra 
photo opportunities. A few Spanish phrases such as 'QUE QUIRE USTED' ('what do you want?') and 'UNA 
HABITACION' ('a room') are included

Terry's Big Adventure looks and feels somewhat similar to Mario's, being a side-scrolling platform 
game using stylised block graphics and lots of ledges to climb up and around. Terry is armed with a 
yo-yo which can be directed as a weapon by pushing the joystick as you hold down fire - an idea later 
repeated by Trolls. On this occasion the use of the yo-yo  causes Terry to recoil slightly, so be 
careful that this does not push him off a ledge or into the path of another enemy. 
 
There are 12 levels in total, incorporating many rivers to cross as well as hordes of hedgehogs, 
snails and similar to kill. Hidden bonus objects and time extensions can be found.  When you start a 
new game you start form the last level you reached, so you effectively have unlimited continues.

for example. Menu options reveal pop-up windows of information and sub-menus. 
 
Planning the raid itself is your next task. An overhead view of the site is prevented, with your 
information on doors and storage locations all readily available. You move each member around the map 
to give them orders, using a displayed clock to ensure that the action timings overlap correctly. 
Many options bring up sub-menus of icons. 
 
During the actual crime, you wait outside, with a walkie-talkie to issue orders. Keep an eye out for 
police cars, as their presence may for you to freeze, or run off with what you have so far. You can 
enter the site to help out, but this leaves you defenceless if the police arrive.

Thing on a Spring (7877) (c) 1985 Micro Projects Engineering / Gremlin Graphics Software Ltd. 
 
The evil Goblin has used his magical abilities to ensnare all the toys in the neighborhood to go into 
his underground lair. Thing bounces to the rescue, and resolves to retrieve them from his 4 storey 
underground lair. To do this he must collect 9 pieces of a jigsaw puzzle on each floor. 
 
Needless to say, Goblin has not made things easy - a myriad of traps await our intrepid hero. There 
are traps all over, some crucial areas are guarded by switches, and the last of these switches locks 
the level-ending lift. 
 
Thing on a Spring is a platform game, made unusual by Thing's motion method. He can bounce to reach 
great heights, and be bounced off platforms strategically to reach higher platforms. You have limited 
oil, which is lost through contact with the many nasties you will encounter.

Thompson Twins Adventure, The (9896) (c) 1984 Quicksilva Ltd. / Computer and Video Games Magazine 
 
The Thompson Twins were a popular 80's music pop trio who took their name from the Tin Tin comic 
book.  In issue 36 of Computer & Video Games magazine dated 10/84, there was attached to the cover, a 
free flexi-disc which contained a message from the group plus this adventure game program imprinted 
in the grooves.  Commodore 64 owners had to mail-in an order to receive their free flexi-disc.  You 
could load the program into the Spectrum by connecting a lead from the headphone socket of your 
record player to the EAR input on the computer.  Otherwise, you could tape the disc's contents to a 
cassette player and load the cassette into the computer (this was only way for the Commodore 64). 
 
 
The story is related to their hit single "Doctor! Doctor!" and begins with the Thompson Twins on a 
beach and then a cave.  Typical of text adventures, you enter directional commands: north, south, 
east, west as well as in, out, up, down.  Other commands such as look, take, read, dig, and inv (to 
see what items you are holding in your inventory) are useful.  You must find any items along the way 
and use them where appropriate.  As part of the promotion, whoever could get through the adventure 
and find the secret of the Doctor's potion by November 16, had a chance to win a meeting backstage 
with the group at one of their concerts and other prizes.  Due to delays in producing the Commodore 
64 flexi-discs, the deadline was extended to December 31 for those computer owners.

Through the Trapdoor (7896) (c) 1987 
 
In his previous adventure, Berk had to complete tasks that were given by his master, the Bad Tempered 
Thing, and had to deal with his creatures that lurk from underneath the Trap Door. Now one day, Berk, 
along with his friend Drutt, decided to explore his domain by going through the Trap Door. 
 
You take control of both Drutt and Berk, swapping between them with the fire button. They need to 
solve a series of puzzles and deal with new creatures along the way. There are four regions to 
explore, and opening locked doors give access to later regions. Scattered throughout the regions are 
sweets and toadstools which, when consumed, will provide Berk with special characteristics. Progress 
is made by using the two characters together, as Drutt can reach places that Berk cannot.

Thrust (7897) (c) 1986 
 
Thrust took a unique game style by bringing realistic physics and inertia-based movement into arcade

The action is viewed from the side, with the graphics drawn in vectors, in keeping with the 
mathematical nature of everything that unfolds. 
 
As a Resistance fighter, the player must fly into enemy lines in order to steal Klystron Pods to 
power more advanced starships, using your tractor beam to take them. A network of mounted guns are 
aiming to shoot the player down – these can be disabled by shooting their power source, but 
eventually this will explode, forcing the player to flee. Some of the later levels feature reverse 
gravity, which is where things really get difficult.

some reason as "Route Packages (RPs)". The most heavily defended area was "RP-6A", in and around 
Hanoi. To enter into this target area, the F-105s had to fly over a region of hilly ground that 
became known as "Thud Ridge".

engaging the MiGs. Your rank may be raised if mission will be accomplished.

mission, and equip your aircraft with weapons and supplies. Taking off the airbase either from Korat 
or another place, you should flight to your destination eliminating the opponent MiGs, run the 
"Ridge", and complete your mission. The gameplay flows in third-person view with common flight 
simulator abilities.

they will allow you to seal the portals. Doing this requires formulating a spell from the runes the 
Minds give you. 
 
All of this is played out in a combination of side-view action and icon-based object manipulation. 
Starting in your living room as you search for a weapon and its bullets, you move along a network of 
levels and ladders, avoiding or shooting the many foes you encounter. Pressing down and fire together 
brings up a menu allowing you to pick up items, swap them with Guardians, and cast spells (with the 
chance to test them first).

Tintin on the Moon (7981) (c) 1989 Infogrames Europe SA / Infogrames Europe SA 
 
Hergé's famous cartoon character is brought to life in this multi-stage action game, specifically 
based around the episode of the same name. In many details the story was similar to the real moon 
landings, then many years off. 
 
A more accurate title for the game would be 'Tintin Gets to the Moon', as reaching it is your 
challenge. The game is split into two distinct types of sections

Tir Na Nog (7983) (c) 1985 Gargoyle Games Ltd / Gargoyle Games Ltd 
 
The first of a trilogy of similarly-designed titles from Gargoyle Games, Tir Na Nog is a complex mix 
of arcade and adventure elements done in an innovative way. The game is viewed from the side, and to 
change direction you must rotate the view. 
 
You play Cuchulainn, and you must restore the Sidhe race to its former position of intelligence, 
enlightenment and civilization. This can be done by retrieving the four pieces of the Seal of Calum, 
which was shattered when the Great Enemy invaded. 
 
Many puzzles are presented in the form of cryptic text messages (displayed in a neat pseudo-Celtic 
font), ranging form 'find my crown for a gift' to 'The backdoor key is me' - lateral thinking is 
required to interpret these messages. 
 
The action side of things is challenging, especially before you have found a good sword or mace. When 
you die, you return to the start of the game, but the settings of objects are left exactly as they 
were - making it important to regularly save the game, as it's possible to lose weaponry in a 
situation so precarious that you have little chance of retrieving it without suffering more combat.

every participant dies. Professor Hybrys’ variant is called Titan and involves a ball, a control unit

hitting them with the sphere, or to pilot it to the exit. The black ball is beyond your control

Titanic Blinky (7987) (c) 1992 Zeppelin Games Limited / Zeppelin Games Limited 
 
Arthur J. Hackensack, an insane Texas billionaire bent on conquering the world, kidnaps professor 
Frobisher Goonhilly, a paranormal scientist working on a matter transformation weapon. As a 
demonstration of its powers, Arthur transforms the Isle of White into a giant custard slice, New York 
into a bath sponge and the Eiffel Tower into a toast rack. The ghost Blinky, secret agent for 
S.P.E.C.T.R.E. (Society for the Prevention of Ectoplasmic Crime, Telekinetic misuse and Reality 
Endangerment), infiltrates the madman's sea ship (the newly raised SS Titanic) armed with an 
ectoplasmic gun and a case full of disguises. 
 
Titanic Blinky is a platform adventure and a clone of Dizzy, replacing the egg protagonist with a 
slightly effeminate ghost. As in that game, the aim is to collect objects (by pulling down on the 
movement controls) to solve puzzles. One main difference from Dizzy is the fact that Blinky carries a 
gun with infinite ammunition. There's an energy bar at the bottom of the screen that gets depleted 
every time Blinky touches an enemy. When it's empty, Blinky literally flips over and the player loses 
one life. The game starts with three lives, and there's no form of saving progress.

You're the president of the Titanic Salvage Company and it's your job to recover any artifacts you 
can find from the wreck of the H.M.S. Titanic and ultimately raise the ship to the surface. 
 
The game combines both above and below water aspects.  Above the water, you must manage the company, 
press conferences and finances.  Below the water, you explore the Titanic and her many secrets by 
navigating T.S.1 (your underwater robot) through a maze-like environment while trying to find a way 
to raise the ship to the surface. 
 
Along the way, you'll find several hidden items that combine to create yet another item, many of 
which are required to open locked doors, safes and other hidden compartments.

TLL sets you as a skilled pilot who must take on a tough mission - shooting out six discs 
representing enemy strongholds in build-up areas. This must be done by lowering your altitude as you 
approach each one, making it crucial to avoid trees and buildings which are closer to ground level. 
 
The action is viewed from above using a psuedo-3D display, and scrolls vertically in a manner similar 
to SWIV. At the side of the screen your altitude and fuel level are displayed, as well as an 
all-important mini-map. You will frequently have to refuel, which is done by touching down on the 
carrier. You don't have direct control over the plane's speed, a fact which takes the game out of the 
realms of simulation somewhat.

Flight simulation specialists Digital Integration turned their attention to helicopter flight in this 
recreation of the AH-64 Apache. All the controls are realistically simulated, so the airspeed is 
dependent on the height of the vehicle, and you can move horizontally using the rudder option as well 
as rolling left and right. If using a Sinclair joystick interface you can use both ports to have all 
these controls accessible on dual joysticks, just like the real thing. Either way, a full instrument 
panel allows monitoring of these. 
 
You are armed with cannons, rockets and anti-tank missiles, each of which has its target set up 
independently, but only one can be loaded at once. Flight options include day/night, clear/cloudy and 
air turbulence on/off, allowing beginners and experts to find a suitable setting. Scenery includes 
trees, mountains and pylons, while enemy targets include helicopters, turrets and tanks.

you are attacked by an obstacle, or if you are shot at by an enemy. You can gain more energy by 
either collecting some pills or a heart, depending on the platform.

Tournament Tennis (8053) (c) 1984 D&L&nbsp / Psion Software Ltd. 
 
Most of the conventions that became standard for tennis simulations appear in this early title - 
indeed many were pioneered by it. Matches can be played at quarter-final, semi-final or final level - 
winning at one level automatically moves you onto the next one. They can last for 3 or 5 sets, with a 
player requiring a 2-game lead to win a set, although a tie-break comes in at 6-6 in all but the 
final set. 
 
The view is pseudo-3D, from above the court, and features a shadow on the ball to give a more 
realistic appearance and make it easier to judge its height. Spectators turn their heads to view the 
action, and ball-boys run on to the court to retrieve a dead ball. Shot speed, direction and spin can 
all be applied, and forehand and backhand strokes are both available.

Tower Toppler (8059) (c) 1988 Hewson Consultants Ltd. / U.S. Gold Ltd. 
 
You play a small green guy who needs to blow up eight towers, because their presence is somehow 
poisoning the water of planets which could potentially be ideal colonies. Unfortunately you need to 
get to the top of these towers to blow them up. 
 
You make your way up to the top of the tower via walkways around the outside of the towers. You need 
to jump over, kick, and run from various enemies in your journey to the top. Most vertical movement 
is achieved by jumping onto moving ledges at the right moment. 
 
The game was considered revolutionary in its time for its graphic technique. As the main character 
walked around the outside of the tower, the character was fixed in the middle of the screen while the 
tower itself rotated. This gave it a pseudo-3D effect. 
 
Towers are linked together via a voyage through the sea in your trusty MK.7 submarine. This plays out 
as a side-scrolling collect-'em-up in which bonus points can be obtained.

There are some touches of dry humour, including an interminable queue of people that you can stand in

some unstable stalactites -- at least if you go the way I did. A 'living tutorial' helps new

Tracksuit Manager varied the conventional Football Manager game style in a number of ways. You take

World Cup. This means there is no transfer market, just a pool of 100 eligible players from which a 
squad of 22 is selected. You can view reports on each player's ability and form at any stage of the 
squad and team selection process. You can arrange friendly matches to try out players and ensure that 
the squad plays together as much as possible. 
 
The matches are presented as a running commentary, with a small graphic indicating which area of the 
pitch the ball is in. A wide range of tactical options are available to dictate the team's passing 
style, defensive approach and so on, and in another first you can give specific instructions to 
individual players (maybe telling a particularly pacy defender to man-mark a dangerous opposition 
winger instead of staying in a set position).

Trains (8087) (c) 1983 Interactive Picture Systems Inc. / Spinnaker Software Corporation 
 
Trains is a top-down managerial game. In the age of steam powered trains, there are opportunities to 
make money on great railroads. It will be up to the player to take control of a train on a railroad 
and turn a profit. The player does this by moving the train to a loading station that will supply raw 
material, and stopping in front of it with the appropriate car and blowing the whistle to begin the 
loading process. This is then delivered to the stations of industries that need them, unloading 
taking place the exact same way. The faster goods are delivered, the more money is made, with extra 
profits available when an industry is in critical need of a supply. Meters of available industry 
supplies can be shown on the screen. The train itself can only be stopped and move forwards and 
backwards, following the path of the train track, left and right movement is used only at switches, 
where the track splits into two directions. Each action of train movement uses coal, multiplied by 
the weight of the goods being carried. Coal is resupplied at the coal yard, and is loaded into the 
coal car the same way as other goods, spending money in order to buy coal. If the player runs out of 
coal while driving the train, it will cost them twice as much to have the coal delivered to the 
train. Every 3 minutes, $200 is deducted from the player for payroll and any crashed train costs 
another $200 in penalties. Each level is a unique track design, and can take place across cities, 
deserts, mountains and plains. As industry supplies are managed, a track is gradually built at the 
edge of the screen which will lead to the next level.

Transformers - The Battle to Save the Earth (8095) (c) 1986 Activision, Inc. / Activision, Inc. 
 
Based on the popular 1980s animated cartoon of the same name, The Decepticons are building a giant 
robot to threaten the Earth. Players must keep track of their action on a game map and send the 
appropriate Autobot (Cliffjumper, Bumblebee, Rodimus Prime, Hot Rod, Hound, Pipes, Blurr and Kup are 
featured) to combat each threat and prevent the Decepticons from stealing energy to build their giant 
robot. In order to accomplish this, the Decepticons must undergo a sequence of events in their 
complicated plan that takes place in such locations as: off-shore oil rig, nuclear power plant, 
Dinosaur Park, space center, Andreas Zoo, and a pipeline.. As a brief overview: First, energy must be 
collected to power-up a dinosaur in Dinosaur Park. This dinosaur will then be sent to collect Space 
Dust from the space shuttle before destroying it. The space dust will be used to grow hippopotami to 
gigantic proportions and use them to collect more energy from the pipeline.  The Autobots' ultimate 
goal is to interrupt and delay this sequence. 
 
In Transformers players choose the Autobot to go to locations on the map.  When they reach the 
location the game switches to a first-person view, and players have to move a cross hair to shoot at 
a near-endless stream of Decepticon jets that fly onto the screen. Players can be hit by their 
missiles - too many hits and the screen cracks up and the Autobot is defeated, requiring another one 
to take it's place.  The more Decepticon jets that are destroyed, the longer it takes for the 
Decepticons to progress to the next stage of the plan, in sequence. 
 
The game's intro features over a minute of speech which is notable both in 1984 and for the Commodore 
64 platform itself.

Berk is trying to obtain a chest of treasure from within a castle inhabited by the Bad Tempered 
Thing. This involves completing five tasks, although a learner mode in which only 4 are required is 
also provided. The first task is to provide a can of worms, whilst crushed eyeballs must be provided 
for task two. You then need to boil Slimies, fry eggs (getting them is a dilemma in itself), and then 
force everything back into the trapdoor. These tasks must be completed before Thing’s Angry Meter 
reaches its limit. 
 
As fans of the TV show will recall, the Trap Door of the title seals in numerous strange monsters, 
and in the game some are harmful and some are a hindrance, depending on the task at hand, so be 
careful which ones are released. Remember to close it, as spooks will be released if you do not – 
these require food to be pacified. Boni and Drutt appear regularly – the former giving cryptic 
morsels of advice, and the latter eating spiders and getting in the way. You can prepare for one task 
while completing another, so pay attention to items which may be useful, and think about what they 
are likely to be used in conjunction with.

reason, there is a big cellar beneath the jungle into which Cuthbert may fall. It may be used as a 
way to avoid the dangers on the surface, but it is also inhabited by nasties, and you may run into a 
cul-de-sac. To spice things up, you only have 20 minutes to reach the end.

Treasure Hunt (10942) (c) 1985 Macsen Software / Macsen Software 
 
Treasure Hunt is a game based on a popular UK television series of the 1980's. 
In the program, contestants were given cryptic clues and which led from one location to another. They 
had to decipher these clues and direct a real-life TV presenter and her camera crew to those 
locations in a helicopter. 
 
The game follows the same pattern. It comes with a 60+ page book containing extracts from Ernest 
Benn's 'Blue Book' guides to England, Scotland and Wales, however the instructions do say  that a 
large scale map would be useful too. 
The game consists of four hunts 
 
1. Greater London 
2. South Devon 
3. Anglesey 
4. The Fife Peninsular 
 
The best way to describe the game is to follow one of the clues. 
The third hunt is based on and around Anglesey, an island off the North West coast of Wales. 
The first clue is 'Pass lop-sided nobleman to the place of churning water to replace missing member'. 
The player is given 10 seconds to read the clue and then the game begins. 
Reading the book the player will find that to the west of the start location is the Anglesey Column 
which is dedicated to the Marquis of Anglesey who lost a leg at Waterloo, hence lop-sided. 
A little further away is Llanfair P. G., noted for having one of the longest place names in the world 
and which, when translated, refers to a rapid whirlpool, hence churning water. 
Both of these are pointers to the first destination. 
The helicopter on the ground by the Menai Bridge. The player instructs the pilot to 'TAKE OFF' and 
then types the name of the town / geographic feature that they think the clue refers to. After a 
while the helicopter lands and the player is either given the next clue, or is told 'No Clue Here'.

Treasure Island (8121) (c) 1985 Byron Preiss Video Productions, Inc. / Windham Classics 
 
Jim Hawkins is a young boy working on "Admiral Benbow", his parent's inn. One day a sea captain named 
Billy Bones takes a room at the inn and stays for several months. A blind man called Pew arrives and 
shows something to Billy that gives him a heart attack. Jim witness everything and runs to aid the 
captain, who tells him about his sea chest and his relationship with Captain Flint, a famous pirate. 
After her dies Jim grabs the key dangling from the corpse and opens the dead captain's chest to 
collect the last payment. He finds a packet inside, and decides to take it to two aristocratic 
acquaintances of his, Dr. Livesey and Squire John Trelawney. They discover a diary and a treasure 
map, and decide to travel to the island in search of the booty. 
 
Treasure Island is a text adventure, an adaptation of the homonymous classic 1883 Scottish novel. 
Unlike the book, the game is written in second person. Otherwise, it follows the original plot 
closely: the player assumes the role of Jim Hawkins, and has to perform the same actions as the 
character in the novel. This leads to a more claustrophobic design, as players without knowledge of 
the book have to guess what to do next. To help alleviate that problem, other characters act as some 
sort of on-line hint system. The player can ASK them ABOUT anything and they will provide clues when 
these are available. The parser accepts most of the Infocom's standard features like pronouns and 
chain commands.

Trivial Pursuit (8162) (c) 1988 Oxford Digital Enterprises Ltd. / Domark Software, Inc. 
 
This is the earliest home computer incarnation of Horn Abbot International Ltd's classic board game, 
Trivial Pursuit. The game involves answering questions on one of six subject categories to gain 
moves, and answering questions on special squares to gain one of the six 'Wedges' you need to gain 
the right to take on the final winning question. Questions are aimed at British players - many 
entertainment questions are based on British TV, and sport questions relate to popular British 
sports. 
 
Two game modes are available:- single player (which involves answering questions against the clock) 
and multiplayer (where you can take on up to five human-controlled players). The computer reveals the 
answer, and you select 'yes' or 'no' to tell it whether you got it right. 
 
The question categories are exactly the same as the board game, however two different question styles 
are added to take advantage of computer technology - some questions relate to a picture or diagram 
and some relate to a piece of music. 
 
One additional feature not available in the board game is a statistical analysis of the number and 
type of questions answered correctly. This can be split into the performances of all the players, or 
the performance of an individual player within the six categories. It is especially useful at the end 
of the game, when choosing which category a player must answer to win the game.

Trivial Pursuit - A New Beginning (8164) (c) 1988 Oxford Mobius / Domark Software, Inc. 
 
After recreating the original board game as closely as possible with the first licensed game, Oxford 
did something different with the sequel. Each player now controls a spaceship, and the overall aim is 
to convince the Elders of the planet Genus  to accept your people's plan to colonize it. 
 
The Elders are all located in different parts of the galaxy, and can only be reached by travelling 
through the galaxy answering questions correctly, and answering a specific question once you get 
there. As a result, the gameplay isn't vastly different from the original. 
 
The six question categories are the same as the original, and there are 50 levels of question to 
clear, but the big difference is that the question category is random, so players who are only 
knowledgeable in one or two areas are no longer at an advantage.

Trolls (8171) (c) 1993 Flair Software Ltd. / Flair Software Ltd. 
 
This platform game features the small blue-haired cutesy creatures that were popular around the time 
(although surely not with most computer game buyers?). You play a Troll roaming the levels in the 
hope of rescuing as many baby trolls as possible - each level gives you a set minimum to retrieve 
before you can leave via the Pigstop. 
 
Initially you have no weapons, and contact with the nasties costs you energy, but a Yo-Yo can be 
collected, which can be used not only to kill enemies, but also to smash blocks away and open up 
paths, and even (with practice) tied to a ledge to allow you to swing across a gap. 
 
Throughout the levels you will find the letters B,O,N,U,S and G released from bonus balloons or on 
killing an enemy - if at the end of a level your letters spell out Bonus or Bogus you go to the 
appropriate extra level. The former has a chance to gain extra lives, the latter must be escaped 
quickly to avoid losing a life.

adventure game which requires minimal typing, using the spacebar to select from several possible 
actions which are listed on the screen and pressing enter to perform the selected action.

You are aboard a powerful boat, deep in enemy territory, and must get through this to make it back in

must be collected to complete the level. Gameplay is side-scrolling, and the boat can be steered up 
and down the screen as well as accelerated in either direction. 
 
The waterways have many mounds and blockades in place, as in Spy Hunter.  Enemy boats and planes 
shoot at you, and also drop mines.

Turbo Charge (8212) (c) 1991 System 3 Software, Ltd. / System 3 Software, Ltd. 
 
The intro shows us Iraqi terrorists breaking into an U.N. military camp escaping with the stockpile. 
Now it's the turn of the British agents Agaippa and Dausus to catch the terrorists and secure the 
stockpile. 
 
This is a classical "Drive & Shoot" game. You are controlling a red sports car, driving down a narrow 
road, shooting every car on the road while trying to avoid the enemy's gunfire and various obstacles 
on the road (The story tells us, it's a chase through hazardous countries like Saudi Arabia, Iraq, 
Thailand, South Africa and more). 
 
The difficulty increases from stage to stage. While in the first stages there is almost no hostile 
activity almost all cars will start shooting you on sight later in the game. Even worse, there are 
helicopters and jets going to attack you too. 
Various obstacles on the road will make it harder to keep the upper hand on the street. These 
obstacles range from cones, to mines and even rather large rocks. 
Finally there are various intersections where always one will lead into a dead end, causing your car 
to crash.

Turbo Esprit puts you in control of a Lotus Esprit cop car, with the challenge of breaking up a drugs 
gang and protecting the innocent. 
 
A map is built into the car, which can instantly show the positions of the baron's cars - this is 
crucial because you can't interrupt them before the initial deal is done, as this will simply make 
them leave and try again another time. 
 
The game's environment is large and varied, with traffic lights, junctions and zebra crossings 
accurately implemented, and pedestrians to avoid. The roads are multi-laned, and at the end of each 
road you can turn across, which makes the game's perspective shift in a flick-screen manner. One 
unusual feature for the time is a saveable high-score table.

After Doctor Mulliner and his assistant Beckett make a mistake using Cybernetic technology 
prototypes, Mulliner’s pet tortoise Wal is given super powers. The only way a working machine can be 
built is for this tortoise to travel through time and collect the required parts from six time 
periods (Prehistoric, Ice Age, Egyptian, Mediaeval, 20th Century and the Future). 
 
Taking the role of Turbo the Tortoise, the player must travel through six side-scrolling platform 
levels, each of them well-guarded by enemies. Limited weaponry can be collected, although jumping on 
the heads of these foes will also kill them. Turbo must allow for moving platforms, switches, fragile 
platforms and water hazards. Enhancements and extra lives are in hard-to-reach places, often only 
accessible by using enemy heads as launch pads.

Turmoil (8224) (c) 1983 Sirius Software, Inc. / Sirius Software, Inc. 
 
Turmoil is a fast-paced shooter. You pilot a ship that is trapped within a chamber of seven tunnels.  
Your ship can only move up and down along a vertical corridor connecting the tunnels.  You are not 
alone, however.  A variety of enemies travel along these tunnels, focused on destroying you.  
Therefore, the ultimate objective of “Turmoil” is to zoom up and down the center alley and blast 
aliens as they streak by.  Keep shooting and keep moving, and you will survive to live another day!  
As you move quickly up and down, you must also fire your own weapons into to the left or right side.  
Part of the intensity of this game is driven by the fact that you can't stay in one place for too 
long.  If you do, an indestructible enemy will come flying at you, forcing to move onward once more. 
 
The enemy ships you will encounter in each of the seven tunnels travel at a variety of unique speeds. 
 The faster a given enemy moves, the more points you will receive if you shoot them.  Occasionally 
when you destroy one of the enemy ships, a flashing orb will appear at the far end of the tunnel.  
This is the one exception where you are not restricted to your vertical pathway.  In these situations 
you are allowed to move down the tunnel to recover it.  If you grab it quickly, it is worth bonus 
points.  If you hesitate, it hatches into a fast moving missile and will destroy you if you get in 
its way. 
 
When you start a game of Turmoil, you are given five ships.  If you can blast all of the aliens in a 
level, you'll receive a bonus ship.  In addition to your current ship, you can hold as many as six 
reserve ships at one time.  You will loose a ship if you make contact with any of the passing aliens. 
 There are nine levels to the game, each with multiple waves to complete, and each one faster and 
more challenging then the previous level.  This is considered by many to be one of 20th Century Fox's 
best games.

In this Mahjongg variant the player has to remove the tiles with the same marks from the board until 
all the board is completely empty. The elimination of tiles is allowed if these tiles are projected 
on the same line with no other tiles in their projection path. There are a certain number of same 
items on each level. The player can mark the tiles, or cancel the action to change the decision. The 
dead-ends exist if the strategy of tiles elimination was incorrect. Games are time-limited and a 
certain number of 'next move' suggestions are available during gameplay. 
 
The game sports three difficulty levels as well as a 1 or 2-player mode. The best scores are saved in 
the high score table.

Turrican II - The Final Fight (8234) (c) 1991 Rainbow Arts Software GmbH / Rainbow Arts Software GmbH 
 
Turrican II: The Final Fight is a platformer/shooter as typically seen on consoles, but designed for 
home computers from the ground up. 
 
Its plot is - naturally - very simple: an evil mega-robot called The Machine attacks the United 
Planets Ship Avalon 1, slaughtering all who resist. All - except Bren McGuire, who manages to escape 
and slips into the experimental Turrican bionic armor. As Turrican, he strives to show The Machine 
who's the boss. 
 
Unlike other games of its type, this game contains three levels of horizontal shooter action in the 
spirit of R-Type or the developers' own Katakis. Six large worlds are to be explored, where you are 
basically free to go everywhere you want, since there is no automatic scrolling and the levels are 
packed with hidden extra lives and weapons. All those levels are very different: the first one in the 
rock desert is pretty colorful with parallaxing rainbow background and happy music, while the 
following worlds get darker and darker. 
 
Turrican can get some different weapons for his arm cannon: 
 
1. The bounce weapon which rebounds from surfaces into smaller bouncing balls when powered up

Finding the mysterious Elephant's Graveyard in Africa was your Father's lifelong quest. When he 
disappears you are determined to find out what might have happened to him, and what secrets may lie 
within. 
 
This side scrolling arcade adventure is split into three stages, taking in the harsh and barren 
desert, an underground network of caves, and a tough tribal jungle. The natives are hostile to your 
presence, and weaponry must be found to fend them off, although its use does little to put the 
natives at ease initially. The machete to cut through the jungle is equally important. At many other 
points you will need to use objects you have found along the way. The backgrounds are in full 3D and 
can serve to obscure the character when he is behind trees or rocks.

moments in the match, and each match is preceded by a TV-style introduction. The game is primarily 
action-based, although you also choose your plays before executing them. You then bring the passes 
and runs to life on the pitch itself. You can play single matches or full leagues, with any of the 
NFL teams of the time.

Typhoon of Steel (8270) (c) 1988 
 
Typhoon of Steel is a tactical level simulation of small unit actions during WWII. It is a sequel to 
the best selling Panzer Strike and the rules are very similar. Three theaters are covered: the 
Pacific Theater (Americans vs Japanese), the Asian Theater (British vs Japanese) and European Theater 
action involving American vs German troops. 
 
Typhoon of Steel includes practically every ground weapon used by the combatants in this theater 
(over 220 weapon types). Units consist of infantry squads or single guns and tanks. You can choose to 
simulate either single battles or entire campaigns spanning several years. In the single battles you 
can play against another person but in campaigns you play against the computer. 
 
The ultimate objective of the campaign games is to fight and win as many battles as possible before 
the war ends. If you suffer heavy losses during one battle it will take a long time to replace and 
upgrade your forces before you can fight the next battle. Single scenarios can last from 30 minutes 
to 2 hours with campaigns lasting up to 30 hours. Like Panzer Strike, the gameplay is considered to 
be advanced level.

Ugh is a caveman who must prepare himself for the oncoming ice age. To survive, he must gather food,

must go from his cave to the top of the mountain and rob Pterry's nest. Pterry, flying at the top of

tyrannosaurus rex, who hunts Ugh back and forth on the mountain paths. Ugh can use his spear to kill 
either beast, but the spear must be used carefully, since only one can be carried. Ugh must also drop 
the spear in order to be able to carry the pterodactyl eggs back to his cave.

Ultima II - The Revenge of the Enchantress! (8286) (c) 1983 
 
The sequel to Ultima featured several improvements over the original, such as separate town and world 
maps, and the concept of traveling through time gates into different eras on Earth. Other than that 
the gameplay is pretty much the same as in Ultima I, with your single character roaming the land 
fighting monsters and looking for key items. 
 
In the original Ultima a hero from a certain third rate blue planet orbiting an insignificant yellow 
sun came to the world of Sosaria and slew the evil wizard Mondain before he could fulfill his dreams 
of universal domination. Thus peace was brought to Sosaria, and the hero hailed as a champion of the 
people of all time. 
 
Unfortunately, Mondain happened to have a young apprentice/lover named Minax who is understandably 
upset over his death. Using her considerable powers, Minax travels through time and space to the 
hero's homeworld of Earth and instigates a nuclear war, thus serving the dual purpose of working out 
her frustration as well as erasing the hero from history. Of course, as the hero, this works out 
rather badly for you, and so with the help of Lord British you must travel through time and somehow 
find Minax and prevent the events which culminate in the destruction of Earth.

Ultima IV - Quest of the Avatar (8288) (c) 1985 OSI / OSI 
 
The fourth game in the now well-established Ultima series featured an improved game engine, with 
color graphics and better character interaction (you could now have actual conversations with NPCs). 
But what really makes Ultima IV shine is its radical departure from any other RPG made before or 
since in terms of the story and goal. 
 
Instead of building up your character by any means possible in order to face the Ultimate Evil in a 
big bang up showdown, in Ultima IV you were trying to become the Avatar, a role model of sorts for 
the people of the land. This meant upholding the "eight virtues" and basically trying to become a 
better person. In most RPGs you chose to be a just/nice hero because the people you'd help would 
usually provide you with some nice equipment for your services, but in Ultima IV you helped people 
not for a reward or to advance the plot but simply because it was the "right thing to do". The game 
actually frowns on behavior that was typical of most other RPGs, such as backstabbing fleeing 
monsters or picking up everything that wasn't nailed down even if it didn't belong to you. The game 
keeps track of all your actions, so if you went about killing and looting like in most RPGs, you'd 
never finish the game. 
 
This VERY different approach to the game's ultimate goal is what makes Ultima IV famous so many years 
later, and became the sort of design philosophy that made all the following Ultimas so unique in 
their genre. 
 
Of course, the game still has plenty of traditional RPG elements such as dungeons to explore and 
hostile monsters to kill, as well as a typical final "Holy Grail" type quest where you had to find 
the Codex of Ultimate Wisdom to complete your transformation into Avatarhood.

Ultimate Wizard (8295) (c) Sep 01, 1986 Progressive Peripherals & Software / Electronic Arts, Inc. 
 
This updated version of Wizard is a platform-style game which was likened to Epyx's Jumpman. Your 
character is the Ultimate Wizard.  You must face dark enemies as you move through the bricks, 
ladders, staircases of the game. Cast spells to destroy them, or otherwise avoid them using 
levitation arrows or other magic.  When you Wizard finds the key and places it in the keyhole, he is 
finished for that level, but soon the next level will appear while sounds play as the level 
materializes in front of the player. 
 
Controls are 4-way joystick.  1-6 players can alternate in turns.  As well as the 40 levels from the 
original Wizard, there are 60 more included - some submitted by the public, and some designed by Paul

Ultima VI - The False Prophet (8290) (c) 1991 ORIGIN Systems, Inc. / ORIGIN Systems, Inc. 
 
This is the first Ultima game to be created first for the PC and then converted later to other home 
computer systems rather than the other way around. Because of this, the game is larger and richer in 
its graphical environment and interactivity. 
 
In this conclusion to the Second Trilogy, you, the Avatar, are summoned back to save Britannia from 
the Gargoyles, a strange race of beings who have taken control of the Eight Shrines of Virtue.  
Conceived to be evil by the people of Britannia, the Gargoyles are discovered to be struggling for 
survival against ancient forces you had not imagined. You must help the Gargoyle race by learning 
their culture, language and vocabulary. Adventure with your companions Iolo, Shamino and Dupre in 
this gigantic world riddled with monsters and puzzles. 
 
The game features a top-down interface, animated graphics in vivid colors as well as original music, 
sound effects and thousands of objects to be manipulated.

Ultima V - Warriors of Destiny (8289) (c) 1988 ORIGIN Systems, Inc. / ORIGIN Systems, Inc. 
 
Ultima V uses the basics of the Ultima IV engine, an overhead perspective of Britannia or one of many 
towns or dungeons, which use a rosette-compass 3D view. Many actions are expanded, including much 
more world interactivity and much deeper characters than the 'signpost' NPCs of Ultima IV. 
 
In Ultima V, you, the Avatar and Hero of Britannia, are called back to deal with a new threat - the 
tyrant Blackthorn, who, after the disappearance of Lord British, now rules the land by enforcing the 
virtues upon the will of the people, corrupting their meaning in the process. Behind Blackthorn are 
the Shadowlords, anti-thesis to the three Principles. Their meaning and origin are explored later in 
the game, rounding out an immersive world and very meaningful plot.

Underwurlde (8314) (c) 1985 Ashby Computers and Graphics Ltd. / Firebird Software Ltd. 
 
Sabreman’s second game (following Sabre Wulf and preceding Knight Lore and Pentagram) finds him 
trapped in an underground cavern network, split into nearly 600 side-viewed screens. There are three 
ways to escape, each protected by a guardian who can be killed using one of the three major weapons 
you can locate – a dagger, a torch and a knife. 
 
As you explore the levels, you will encounter randomly-moving nasties, who can’t kill you but can 
knock you off your path and cause you to fall. Eagles can grab and drop you in mid-air. Falls of much 
more than a screen’s height cost you a life, although extra ones are available. Jewels can be 
collected for temporary invincibility. 
 
The game’s screens are functionally split into Castle and Caverns, with the castle screens higher up. 
Moving across the castles involves a lot of blind jumps, often deliberately bouncing off 
fortuitously-placed objects such as flower pots. In the caverns, use a rope to hook onto the ceilings 
and move up and down – if you have found it. How many screens deep you are is noted on screen at all 
times.

Pen and the Dark, The (11345) (c) 1984 
 
This text only adventure is based on one of the chapters of the Science Fiction short story series 
"The Unorthodox Engineers" by Colin Kapp. 
You take on the role of the protagonist Lieutenant Fritz van Noon and his band of "Unorthodox 
Engineers" as Dr. Maxwell Courtney asks you to try and discover the purpose of the indestructible 
pillar of darkness and its mysterious penumbral shadow, (hence the name "The Pen") which was 
(obviously?) left by an alien race on this otherwise normal planet. And you also have to solve the 
riddle of contra-energy. 
The objective of the story is outlined to the player during the opening stages of the adventure. The 
book with the short story that comes along with the game helps the player to better understand the 
story and contains some vital clues to solve some of the adventure's puzzles.

Valley, The (8347) (c) 1982 
 
The Valley is an ancient graphical roguelike RPG with an easy to use interface and a quite detailed 
and nearly-realtime combat system for its time. 
 
The background story is all but non-existent, suffice to say that you're the hero and you want to 
explore the name-providing Valley to slay monsters and find treasure. Classic! 
 
Character creation is equally quick and easy -- enter your name and choose one of five classes 
(Warrior, Wizard, Cleric, Barbarian and the not-so-common Thinker), differing by their magic and 
fighting abilities. 
 
After that tedious work, you're ready to explore the Valley and its contents. You start out at a one 
of two castles, where you can rest and save your game. The road between the castles is safe, but 
every other place is teeming with monsters, magic places (upgrading or downgrading your stats) and, 
of course, treasure. The valley also contains a multi-level tower as well as some swamps and forests, 
which feature some other dungeons. 
 
The game is played in a turn-based manner, except fighting which is timed delay. As you only have 
half a second or so to enter your next move, it gets quite challenging. It is also quite 
sophisticated for its time: You can attack the monster's head, body or legs, or you can cast one of 
three magic spells. Of course, some monsters can do the same to you. Finally, you may sometimes 
surprise a monster, getting a free attack or the choice to retreat (which is not possible in a normal 
fight). 
 
Each level is randomly generated at the beginning of the game. The game provides a saving mechanism 
with 10 possible save games. Despite its simple graphics, the quick and easy gameplay and the 
challenging combat make this game quite advanced for its time.

95 horrifying rooms you will be besieged by his slaves, try to avoid them and obtain the greater 
amount of food as possible. If you reunite the 5 keys and you introduce them in its 5 corresponding 
bolts you would have done a very important part of the mission. In order to obtain each key you must 
find a certain object and fix it in the "generator by pedals", if you do it well you will be able to 
jump the enormous pit. The second part of your mission consists in opening the 6 magical 
counter-windows pressing the suitable switches. Finally, search for the hammer and the stake and walk 
quickly to the superior part of the castle to take the cross. At this moment you will be teleported 
to the space to get rid of the final confrontation in which you will be able to use the laser weapon 
and the self-propelled knapsack.

Vampire's Empire (8349) (c) 1988 Magic Bytes / Gremlin Graphics Software Ltd. 
 
Vampire's Empire casts you as Doctor Van Helsing, making another attempt to rid the world of Dracula. 
The world consists of 160 side-view screens, with others accessed via push-scrolling, but must be 
freed of vampires within a time limit. 
 
Van Helsing's method of killing is to use mirrors to reflect his beam of light onto them. He must 
always keep this under control. Bats and snakes must be avoided, as they cost Van Helsing energy. 
Coffins must be avoided, as they release nasties which will chase you.

Vector Ball (8358) (c) 1988 Binary Design, Ltd. / Mastertronic Ltd. 
 
This one on one future sport combines ideas from a number of real-world competitions, most notably 
the schoolgirl favourite Netball (I wonder why the ad blurb makes no mention of this?). The action is 
viewed isometrically, so moving the joystick up moves your droid north-east, down moves south-west, 
and so on. 
 
The aim is to score more points than your opponent in each match, and be the first to win four 
matches (against either a human or computer opponent), before moving up to the next difficulty level. 
There is a goal in the middle at each end, and the ball can be advanced by shooting it (the length of 
a shot is affected by pushing the joystick up or down with fire pressed) as you can't run with the 
ball, or hold onto it for long. The main novel idea in the game is the shaping of the pitches, which 
are viewed in full 3D and have bumps and big divots all around.

In this action-dexterity game you find yourselves on the advanced Velocipede II firing unicycle, with 
four levels to complete within time limits. The game scrolls sidewards from left to right, with the 
player controlling speed but not vertical position. There are hazards to jump over and creatures to 
shoot or avoid. Falling into holes loses one of the player's four lives, while hitting an enemy 
drains an energy bar (which is refilled when a life is lost for either reason). When a level is 
completed, bonus points are awarded for the amount of remaining time. The game has a reputation for 
being very easy to complete within just a few minutes.

Mask III - Venom Strikes Back (4609) (c) 1988 Gremlin Graphics Software Ltd. / Gremlin Graphics 
Software Ltd. 
 
VENOM Strikes Back is a single player side scrolling, two dimensional, shoot-em-up. It is the third 
game to be based on the popular MASK comics, TV series, and books of the mid 1980's. 
 
The M.A.S.K., Mobile Armored Strike Kommand, organisation led by Matt Trakker, are battling the 
criminal organization known as V.E.N.O.M., Vicious Evil Network of Mayhem. Combat in the previous two 
games has been based around the transformer like vehicles used by M.A.S.K., not so in this game. 
In this game Matt's son has been kidnapped by V.E.N.O.M. and has been taken to the moon. Matt has 
been given an ultimatum, disband M.A.S.K. and leave the world at the mercy of V.E.N.O.M., or never 
see his son alive again. 
 
Matt sets out for the moon where he must overcome the defences of V.E.N.O.M.'s base, rescue his son 
and steal a rocket back to earth. 
In his quest he is helped by special masks that give him special powers. For example one mask will 
give Matt the ability to shoot bullets others will allow him to fly, pass through solid objects, 
float across bodies of water, have temporary invulnerability and so on. However, Matt can only carry 
four masks and can only use one mask at a time. Each mask has just 99 units of energy, or bullets, 
and this number is reduced each time the mask is used so eventually the mask will need replacing. 
 
At the end of each level as Matt progresses to the next the player gets a code word. This codeword 
can be typed in when the game is re-loaded allowing the player to restart at the new level.

You are Detective Sergeant in the Crime Squad at Saint Etienne (Loire). As an Officer of the Police, 
you are capable of leading any criminal investigation. As you took your post up, you were called to 
investigate what the press are fast terming "L'affaire Vera Cruz"(The Vera Cruz Affair). 
 
Prostitute Vera Cruz sprawled on the floor in her "Forest" apartment was found by caretaker. The pool 
of blood poured from a bullet wound in her chest. It was believed to be a case of suicide with a gun 
as the weapon involved. But you have to prove that it was a murder. 
 
The gameplay flows in two parts: crime scene investigation to collect the evidence, and work with 
telex machine to gain information about possible suspects. 
 
At the crime scene, you should collect all possible evidence moving the marker on the screen and 
examining the objects scattered at the scene as well as the body itself. 
 
With telex machine you should perform investigation according to the police procedures. Different 
actions are possible here such as sending messages within Diamond Network to receive the replies, 
printing the notes, contacting other Police services to gain the new information, comparing the 
evidences, carrying out examinations such as autopsy, interviewing/checking the alibis of suspects, 
and arresting finally. To specify the subject for each action you should type it.

Vermeer (8379) (c) 1987 ariolasoft GmbH / ariolasoft GmbH 
 
All centers around Walther von Grünschild, a rich merchant and patron of the arts from Berlin, whose 
art collection was stolen. Now he sends his four nephews into the world to regain his paintings. The 
most successful of them becomes his heir. The game starts in 1918 and ends when von Grünschild dies. 
One round equals one day. The length of a round can be chosen between five seconds and infinite. 
 
In auctions the missing pictures are sold from time to time. But to buy them the player obviously 
needs money. This is gained by opening up to 24 plantations in the Third World. There the player 
either grows coffee, cacao, tea or tobacco. After the harvesting the goods get shipped to warehouses 
in New York or London where the player sells it to interested companies. The player has to be on-site 
for every action which means an important part of the game is to plan ahead where he has to go during 
the next days. Another way to win money is gambling at horse races. 
 
Besides his business the player can visit art schools to gain the ability to distinguish real 
paintings from fake ones. This is useful during the auctions because it is annoying to buy a forgery. 
Another way is to hire a middleman to attend anonymous to the auctions. This way the other players 
don't know he tries to buy a certain painting and it gets cheaper. Of course the middleman can't 
profit from the player's expertise and is more likely to buy a forgery. In Chicago the player can 
hire robbers to steal paintings from his competitors.

ready for the day customers. Some machines are out in the open, while others are in rooms with locked 
doors. The keys are found scattered around the arcade, many of them also found in rooms that are 
locked. It is up to the robot to find the key of the same color. After getting the keys, the door 
will be unlocked so that the droid can get to the key or video machine. 
 
When the robot comes into contact with a machine, it gives it the option of gamble for an extra life 
or for its death. The droid can also decline to gamble, leaving the machine activated and an bonus is 
awarded, depending on how much remaining energy the droid has. 
 
Each room is filled with a variety of hazards

Voidrunner (8426) (c) 1987 Llamasoft Ltd. / Mastertronic Ltd. 
 
The final conflict in the droid wars is up ahead in Jeff Minter's Voidrunner, the second sequel to 
Gridrunner. After the defeat in the Matrix wars the droids are out for revenge, preparing a nuke to 
destroy the earth. Therefore a corps of pilots are sent to the droid home planet with the objective 
to eliminate every single droid. 
 
Gameplay is similar to Gridrunner. Like in Centipede, the enemies move in a pattern down the screen 
and the player have to shoot them before they reach the ship. There's also the zapper, a vertically 
moving line, that occasionally pulses. If the player ship is on the same line when this happen, it 
will die. 
 
The enemies come in many different flavours. The most common ones just explodes when hit, bouncing 
predictable around the screen. We also have the Gridrunner style aliens that when hit leaves a pod 
that needs to be destroyed. Typical for a Minter games, you'll also fight furry animals like camels 
and goats. 
 
New in Voidrunner is that you don't just have one ship, but four. In early levels the ships will move 
around in a cluster. Later in the game some of your ships will have inverted motion. Some of these 
formations will have the ships shooting in different directions. Handy when you have enemies coming 
in from behind.

Volfied (8428) (c) 1991 Taito Corporation / Empire Software 
 
Volfied is a home conversion of an arcade coin-op developed by Taito in the late '80s. The game is 
very similar to Qix -- the player takes control of an object whose purpose is to roam the screen, 
forming shapes and removing them from the play field. By way of reward, a picture is gradually 
revealed in the removed areas of the screen. The borders of the area which the player has not cleared 
become the border of the area the player's pointer can move along. 
 
The player's object must avoid contact with any of the enemies which float around the screen, as this 
will weaken and eventually destroy it. Barriers limit which parts of the border boxes can be formed 
through. The goal is to clear 80% or more of the screen, and each additional percent adds bonus 
points. 
 
As an arcade conversion this game allows for one or two player games in three difficulty levels, but 
offers no passwords or saved games across its numerous levels.

Vultures (8442) (c) 1983 
 
Vultures is an original (?) shoot'em'up with a slight Galaga flavour. Above your spaceship hangs a 
nest of space-vultures. One after one, they come down to shoot at you. Unlike Galaga, they don't wrap 
at the end of the screen, instead they "bounce" back and forth across it. Mind the vulture's course, 
because otherwise you might find yourself trapped in a corner with the inevitable collision as only 
way out. A good tactic to ameliorate your chances is to dodge the vulture's bullets and concentrate 
your fire on its mates that are left hanging above. When all the vultures are killed, their eggs 
start to hatch and spawn similarly devious creatures. Shoot them down, and you have passed the first 
level. 
 
Vultures has three speed settings and runs in medium resolution with a green background.

Wacky Darts (8448) (c) 1990 Big Red Software / Codemasters 
 
The bar-room game of darts involves aiming small projectiles at a circular board. The board is 
divided into 20 shapes around the edge, each of which has a value from 1 to 20 points, a special 
'double' area around the edge, and a special 'treble' area in the middle (each of which multiply the 
shot score). There is also a Bullseye right in the middle for 50 points, and an Outer Bull around it, 
worth 25 points. 
 
Players always take three shots at a time. In the 501 game the aim is to reduce your score from 501 
to 0, finishing with a double or the bull. If your score reaches 1 or a negative number, any shots in 
that set of 3 are cancelled out. In Round The Board you must hit each target in turn starting with 
20, but moving back 2 or 3 for a double or treble, eventually finishing with Double Top. 
 
Both of these games are recreated in this simulation. The movement of the cursor you use to aim is 
slightly skiddy, to recreate natural jitters (or, as some would cynically suggest, the effects of 
being as drunk as most darts players). 
 
Wacky Darts lives up to its name by featuring an assortment of human, alien and machine opponents of 
varying difficulties. Each of them has a short profile, and use a different object to hit the board.

Wacky Races (8449) (c) 1992 PAL Developments / Hi-Tec Software Ltd. 
 
You take on the role of Dastardly and Mutley from the Hanna-Barbera cartoon series in this action 
title with superficial racing overtones. Your aim is to complete each course in a particular 
position, which is achieved either by waiting for them to suffer enough damage to drop out of the 
race, or by inflicting that damage yourself. Your car is armed with a forward-shooting arrow to 
impale the opposition cars, and deal with the many hazards the races throw at you, including boulders 
and rabbits, which can be taken out for points. 
 
The action is viewed from the side, scrolling horizontally as you progress, and vertically when you 
need to jump or duck over the bigger hazards, which must be avoided Moon Patrol style, meaning that 
you must often time one jump properly so as to be able to make the next one successfully. In some 
sections of the road you can duck down onto another set of roads, which may or may not be less 
hazardous. Falling into thin air costs you a life, while heavy impacts deduct some of your energy 
points. When the view doesn’t show the next section, and the correct course is not clear, an arrow 
appears to direct you.

WAR (8468) (c) 1986 Software Communications Ltd. / Martech 
 
The planet Earth is on the verge of being invaded by a group of aliens whose objective is the 
conquest of other planets. They are approaching Earth in a fleet of twenty cylinders containing 
cities, fields, factories, power stations, military bases, and shoe shops. As the aliens launch their 
attack on Earth, a pilot, controlled by the player, has been sent to destroy each cylinder one by one 
within a certain amount of time. 
 
Once the pilot has done enough damage to the cylinder, the pilot then proceeds to the escape portal. 
This escape portal has a security system which consists of five rows of colored squares that scrolls 
from right to left. For a successful hack, the player must line up two arrows that point to a square, 
and fire at the square whose color matches the border of the screen. If the player fails the hack, 
then they have to destroy the cylinder again. If successful, the player proceeds to the next cylinder 
where their 
task becomes more difficult.

WarGames (8489) (c) 1984 Coleco / Coleco 
 
Greetings, Professor Falken. Shall we play a game? 
 
This strategic game is based on the popular 1983 movie of the same name, starring Matthew Broderick. 
It might remind people of Missile Command but the action is slower and spread over six screens which 
represent different areas of the U.S.A. Enemy missiles, planes, and subs will attack and you must 
direct your own forces, which include missiles, planes, subs, and satellites, to intercept them. Each 
type of defense has strengths and weaknesses (missiles are fast but limited in range, planes are 
slower but have unlimited range). Satellites are a better all-around defense but are only available 
every so often. Some weapons aren't available in certain areas, and some enemies are resistant to 
certain weapons, so you must alter your strategy accordingly. 
 
As your bases and cities are struck, a DefCon indicator for each area will count down and when the 
overall DefCon reaches 1 for a minute or when all cities and bases are destroyed, a counterstrike is 
launched and the game is over. The game is won by preventing a counterstrike long enough for a 
cease-fire to be reached. There's eight different difficulty levels to progress through as you get 
the hang of it. A two-player mode on the Colecovision lets one player to use the Roller Controller to 
guide and fire weapons, while the second player inputs keypad commands.

Only you can save the world from destruction, by finding four parts of the weapon to use against the 
Alien Syndicate's evil leader. This task must be completed within 80 minutes, although you have five 
lives available. 
 
Gameplay mainly involves propelling your jumpsuit-backed and powerfully-armed character through the 
levels, destroying the alien forces as he goes. The levels have lots of pieces of ledges and spikes 
all around, which must be planned around, as well as lava pits. There is extra weaponry and 
ammunition to collect along the way. Your main weapon can be fired in any direction, but you can't 
move and fire at the same time unless you're firing to the left or right.

Warrior of Ras Vol.I - Dunzhin (8505) (c) 1983 
 
Dunzhin is a simple rpg adventure game that is similar to Rogue. Your goal is to enter a dangerous, 
multi level dungeon and return with a valuable treasure. The game uses simple keyboard commands to 
move about and interact with the environment. As you explore the maze like dungeon, you will come 
across various enemies which you can attempt to fight, bribe, hide from or even run away. Different 
creatures have different weaknesses, so to improve your chance of success you should note the best 
approach to dealing with a particular enemy. You begin the game with a limited number of hit points, 
and if you lose them all the game will be over. In addition to the main treasure you are after, you 
may also discover some additional bonus treasures hidden in various rooms or by bribing creatures. 
Good luck on your quest!

$bio
 
 
Warrior of Ras Vol.II - Kaiv (8506) (c) 1983 Intelligent Statements, Inc. / Screenplay 
 
This is the sequel to the first part of the Warriors of Ras series, Dunzhin. All games in this series 
are early graphical Roguelikes. The story is quite simple: Enter the mystical monster-infested 
dungeon Kaiv, slay monsters and grab treasures. 
 
You explore the dungeon in a turn-based manner by entering commands in text adventure, like "MOVE 
NORTH" or "LIGHT TORCH". The commands may be abbreviated by one or two letters. You can also move 
several squares at once (like "MOVE EAST 3") to speed up your quest. Another very helpful command is 
"SPEED", which makes the game's messages go by faster. Your progress is hindered by traps (acid 
pools, slimey floors etc., some of which you can escape by quickly pressing a key), thieves who rob 
you, random teleports and, of course, by a variety of 24 different monsters, ranging from simple 
Zombies, Wolves or Dwarves up to Wyverns and Vampires. 
 
The combat system makes the Warriors of Ras series stand out from other roguelikes: Apart from your 
total hit points, you and the monsters also have hit points and armor for each body party separately. 
If the hit points of one body part reach zero, you're dead. Each attack must be directed to one of 
the body parts, some of which are easier to hit than others. You may also "AIM" a hit (which costs 
some time, but makes the attack more likely to hit) or "FORCE" an attack (this makes it more 
difficult to hit, but increases the damage). This and the body parts result in a quite tactical 
combat -- you have to guess or find out the weak parts of your opponent and choose the right way of 
attacking. 
 
Kaiv extends the originally quite simple game of Dunzhin by adding a shop at the dungeon entrance 
where you can equip yourself. You now also have a bigger variety of items like torches, crosses 
(against Vampires) and mirrors (against Gorgons), and you can also find magical items: several rings, 
wands or potions that improve your magical or physical protection or increase you fighting skills. 
You also need to take enough food and drink with you to prevent dying from hunger or thirst. 
 
The difficulty level of the game is quite high with new characters -- you often die just by being hit 
once by a low-level monster or by stepping into some trap. The game is generous in allowing you to 
save your progress at any time.

half a point, but a jumped sword attack might be awarded with one and a half points. The fighter who 
first scores six points wins the round. Wasteland features a single player tournament with an 
adjustable difficulty level and a two player mode.

Way of the Exploding Fist, The (8526) (c) 1985 Beam Software Pty., Ltd. / Melbourne House 
 
This menacingly-titled beat 'em up was the first in many martial arts titles from Australia's 
Melbourne House. Sixteen different moves are on offer, ranging from standard kicks to jumps, 
somersaults and roundhouse kicks. 
 
The move executed each time is defined based on the character's direction, the joystick/keyboard 
positioning, and on whether the fire button is depressed, in a system which became standard on 
single-button control systems. 
 
To win each bout you must score 2 Yin-Yangs - a perfectly executed kick/punch scores a full one, 
whereas a less forceful contact offers half a point - the best moves also offer more points. In the 
one-player game, you advance through a Dan by winning two successive bouts, and a single win for the 
opponent means game over. The champion in a two-player duel is decided by points after 4 rounds.

scores to disk. Up to nine in-progress games can also be saved. 
 
You have a compass and a map-making kit, enabling the game to automatically map the areas you 
explore. These can be stolen by the Cleptangle beast, but you can chase him to get them back. 
 
You can't push against the wind without finding a special way of overcoming it. Fireflies 
automatically move with the wind, and can serve as a clue to its direction.

Weatherwar II (8532) (c) 1982 Magic Carpet Software / Magic Carpet Software 
 
In this game, an enhanced clone of  Ouranos!, feuding sides again settle their disputes with 
aggressive weather patterns.  On opposite sides of the screen, two players with some pull over local 
weather conditions take turns assaulting each others' castles with their pick of hail, rain, 
lightning or tornadoes.  These attacks emanate from an itinerant cloud drifting variously across the 
top of the screen, and must be directed by a numerical "charge" value from -150 (very left) to 150 
(very right) intended to account for a shifting wind speed and the location of the cloud.  The winner 
is whichever party completely obliterates their opponent's abode first. 
 
Beyond the enhanced graphics (still rendered with a text mode character set, but now with awesome 
colour!) this version's major gameplay addition is the Act of Nature, a random attack of a random 
weather type at a random location that sometimes does (and sometime doesn't) occur between player's 
pot-shots at each other.

its way onto the home systems. Although you're racing against the other cars, you must make each 
checkpoint in the required amount of time in order to complete the game. The lap is split into three 
sections, so the fourth section is identical to the first, the fifth to the second, and so on. 
 
As the game goes on, the bonus time offered for each section drops, so you have to drive better as 
the game goes on to stay in. Night is represented as well, with everything darkened and the need for 
headlights. The circuit features barriers and trackside trees, so avoid contact with these, and try 
not to stray onto the grass as this slows you down.

Western Games has six Wild West themed sport-style events. In Arm Wrestling you must pull the 
joystick back when the arm in the central display has entered a strong phase and press the button to 
prop the arm up then hope for the best. 
 
The Beershooting event requires you to shoot a 5 beer glass targets faster than your opponent, but 
this is not too easy if you get nervous.Player 1 moves the joystick to the right to draw their gun, 
while Player 2 must move theirs to the left. Once the gun is drawn, the crosshairs are used to line 
up the target. Press the joystick button to fire. A beating heart shows the degree of your 
nervousness in the display. 
 
Quid-spitting requires that you bite off the right amount of tobacco and chew it to just the right 
consistency before you determine what angle to spit it into the pot. This requires some fancy 
joystick handling. To lift your arm and bite off the quid, you must move the joystick forward.To 
chew, you must move the joystick fast to the left and right. Don't chew it too long or too short. To 
stop chewing, you must move the joystick forward. Once that is done you must pull the stick back to 
determine the strength. Click and hold the joystick button to determine the right angle. Press the 
joystick button to spit. Timing is the key. 
 
The Milking event has a rhythmically heaving udder indicating the beat that you must move the 
joystick. To fill the cans, the joystick must be moved in a predetermined pattern, but it must be 
moved rythmically with the udder. You can elbow your opponent to get the upper hand by moving your 
joystick to the right and pressing the joystick button. 
 
Dancing requires a complicated routine of joystick movements to do certain dance moves while keeping 
the beat. Lose the beat and the other guys bash the piano player on the head causing him to stop 
playing. You must buy the piano player another beer to have him resume playing. 
 
The Eating competition is the final event. Dip the spoon into the stew. Balance the spoon. Slurp. 
Chew. Swallow. and drink. Simple? No. If you get some out of order, you get delayed by belching. Dip 
the spoon by moving the joystick back. Balance the spoon by moving the joystick to the left and 
right.

Where in the World is Carmen Sandiego (8570) (c) 1986 Brøderbund Software, Inc. / Brøderbund 
Software, Inc. 
 
Carmen Sandiego is a master thief who leads the criminal organization V.I.L.E. This organization 
specializes in stealing the world's treasures without a trace. Alarmed by this, the A.C.M.E. 
Detective Agency makes it their personal mission to foil Carmen Sandiego's plans. 
 
Carmen Sandiego is an game that tests the player's knowledge about geography and general knowledge 
about different countries. Missions will begin with a treasure being stolen and the player flying to 
that location. A time limit counts down while they must search the area and interview witnesses to 
find enough clues to figure out what country the thief flew to next. The player always has a limited 
selection (usually three or four) of flights available in any given country. This process is repeated 
until either the villain is found or time expires and they are able to get away. Along with finding 
out where the thief has headed, the player must discover who the thief is, by best matching personal 
characteristics (gender, hair color, eye color, hobbies, notable features) to dossiers on Carmen's 
gang. There must be enough characteristics matched in order to obtain a warrant, which is essential 
to legally arrest the suspect once they have been found. Progress in arresting VILE members will 
expose other members, eventually leading up to Carmen Sandiego herself.

Whistler's Brother (8578) (c) 1984 
 
The story began years ago on the campus of a large university. You were a first-year student who 
spent more time learning how to sufi dance with a local whirling dirvish than studying. Your brother, 
while always a bit more clumsy and scatter-brained than you, somehow managed to graduate with a 
doctorate and was immediately offered a research position in the archeology department. 
 
Trouble began when your brother returned from a year-long research expedition in the rain forests of 
South America. Not only did he return without any of the tools he'd borrowed from the university, but 
he had no notes documenting how he had spent his year. Out of concern for your brother's future and 
intrigued by his repeated mumbling about priceless ancient artifacts, you decide to retrace his 
steps. 
 
You earn points in the game a number of different ways: retrieving artifacts and tools, protecting 
yourself or your brother, and completing levels. The joystick button lets you whistle or whirl. 
Whistling will keep your brother safely at your side. Whirling will make you impervious to any 
dangers in your path. You can't whirl until you have recovered the two tools from the current level. 
 
Play the game by maneuvering through all 16 levels, collecting artifacts and the tools. Make sure to 
keep your brother nearby or he may stumble into trouble. If you or he gets into trouble, you loose a 
life. Once you've collected the two tools use whirling to blaze past any obstacles.

The White Barrows (c) 1983 Argus Specialist Publications Ltd. / Argus Specialist Publications Ltd. 
 
This is a text based game that has elements from a multiple genres dungeon crawl, puzzle, logic 
challenge, and even resource management. 
The back story is about a bad wizard who's stolen a magic chalice and you play the plucky adventurer 
who has to get it back. The bad guy is hiding in the ancient burial grounds, or barrows. 
The game is based on a map of the barrows in which there are 40 or so rooms. You are dropped randomly 
into a room. In other rooms are gnomes, trolls, dragons etc and in one room is the wizard. 
The game is played by moving from room to room exploring. 
You may view connecting rooms. 
You may raise a magic wall in an adjacent room. 
However you have only 400 magic points and viewing or raising a wall costs points so it's important 
to find the wizard before points run out. 
The game is a text game. There is only one graphic which is the map that shows how the rooms are 
connected.

Wild Streets (8598) (c) 1990 Titus France SA / Titus Software Corporation 
 
New-York, Year 1998. The once most prestigious city in the world, has now become a fighting zone. 
Half of the city is left in ruins, and it is in that part of town that the marginals and gangs are 
living, hunted by every law enforcement agencies. The other half of the city consists of fancy 
mansions, in some of which the most important drug barons reside. 
Unfortunately, they are the ones who run the city using the enormous profits they make from dealing 
drugs and weapons. 
They now have succeeded in endangering the country's economy. 
 
The U.S. government, wanting to avoid a terrible crisis, called the CIA to run several types of 
operations in order to get rid of this bad substitute of government. 
The C.I.A., headed up by "The Boss", has to clean up the city of its crooks. 
One plan is to reorganize the city by placing security check-points at strategic positions. 
The operation was set up for April 4, and quickly proved to be an unprecedented success. 
The badly organized, smaller street gangs, were greatly outnumbered and couldn't match the extremely 
well armed law enforcement troops. 
 
On May 7, during a successful raid, the state police special branch, took possession of a huge 
arsenal of weapons and ammunition, worth more than two million dollars. 
This raid was an important stage in the whole operation. 
Realizing the sticky situation they were in, the heads of the crime organizations now started making 
plans for themselves: They needed to regain their control over the city and above all, secure their 
territories. 
On May 15, they kidnapped "The Boss" in order to get from him the names of his operatives involved in 
the C.I.A. fight against organized crime. 
This way, they were convinced they could stay in control of the situation and become even more 
powerful. 
 
Your mission is to liberate "The Boss" and to bring him back safely. 
 
You're gonna be dropped from the chopper with your panther at the spot where "The Boss" was last 
seen. 
You have your 357 Magnum ready and the panther is trained to protect you closely. 
 
You'll have to travel through the various parts of the city, in search of the hostage, and you will 
find that your street fighting skills will prove to be very useful. 
 
In each part of the city, you will confront various enemies and their gang leaders. 
They will become more and more skilled in combat as you progress. Some of them are so powerful that 
it would be wise to save bullets for these particular fights. 
Once you reach the point where "The Boss" is held prisoner, you must rescue him and safely escort him 
back to a safe place. 
 
On the way back, you will have to be particularly careful, since you will have to protect "The Boss" 
whose physical condition has been worn out. 
 
Wild Streets is a side-scrolling arcade game, in which you fight enemies using punches, kicks, your 
gun and sometimes your panther will help you.

Wings of Fury (8615) (c) 1990 Brøderbund Software, Inc. / Brøderbund Software, Inc. 
 
Wings of Fury is an action game with some minor simulation aspects, in which you are the pilot of an 
American F6F Hellcat plane. The setting of the game is the Pacific during World War II. 
 
It is your job to defeat the Japanese by destroying enemy bunkers, machine gun nests and barracks on 
a series of islands. Barracks and gun nests can be bombarded with regular bombs, while you'll have to 
use rockets to take out the concrete bunkers. After a successful bombing run, return to mow down the 
Japanese soldiers with your machine guns. You also have to sink Japanese battleships with torpedoes 
and engage in dogfights with enemy fighter planes. 
 
 
You start each mission by taking off from an aircraft carrier, which you'll have to protect from 
assaults by Japanese torpedo planes. Whenever you run out of fuel, bombs, rockets or machine gun ammo 
you can replenish those by returning to your carrier. Your carrier is also the place to repair damage 
to your plane. 
 
The Gameboy Color version of Wings of Fury has a toned down violence level. You no longer mow down 
Japanese soldiers with your machine guns, instead you bombard jeeps & trucks. Also missing in this 
version are the Japanese torpedo planes and the small 1st-person view window. New are some extra 
manoeuvres for your plane like a barrel roll and a review of your ammo consumption after each 
mission. Using less ammo than allocated gives you bonus points.

Win, Lose or Draw (9832) (c) 1988 Softie, Inc. / Hi-Tech Expressions, Inc. 
 
Win, Lose or Draw was a popular TV show requiring artistic skills and an ability to think laterally. 
A player on your team draws something on the big game board, and you must work out what it 
represents. They will be common expressions depicted literally, such as 'bright idea' showing a light 
bulb over somebody's head, and 'cabin fever' as a rickety building next to a man with a thermometer 
in his mouth. 
 
In this computerised implementation the drawing phase of the game is handled by the computer, so your 
task is simply to guess the meaning of the picture by thinking laterally. Your team has 60 seconds, 
and you can guess repeatedly, but the picture takes time to take shape. If you fail to guess 
correctly, the opposition has 15 seconds to guess it (with a single try) to steal the money.

Winnie the Pooh in the Hundred Acre Wood (8618) (c) 1984 Sierra On-Line, Inc. / U.S. Gold Ltd. 
 
Early this morning, a strong wind went through the hundred acre wood and picked up many objects and 
scattered them about. It is your job to locate all the objects, determine who the proper owners are, 
and return them. You had better hurry though, before the wind returns again! Along the way you'll 
meet all the familiar Winnie The Pooh characters including Eeyore, Owl, Tigger, and Piglet. 
 
The game's interface involves no typing, instead the cursor keys are used to choose from a list of 
actions specific to the current location or situation, pick up and drop objects, and navigate around 
the wood.

Winter Camp (8619) (c) 1992 Thalamus Ltd / Thalamus Ltd 
 
Winter Camp is the sequel to Summer Camp.  Maximus Mouse is now a rescue ranger at Camp Nice'n'Icy, 
but he soon notices a bird who will knock a pebble down a mountain, setting off a avalanche that will 
engulf the camp, unless he can prevent it, over eight varied levels. 
 
The levels offer various challenges.  The most common type of level is a patrol.  There are three 
such levels, involving ice skating, boating on a river, and skiing.  On each level you have a quota 
of rescues to make.  There are various obstacles on the levels, and a variety of objects to use to 
avoid them.  For example, a spring will allow you to jump over a stretch of water. 
 
At the end of each of these levels is a boss, who must be defeated using the objects you have 
collected.  The bosses are easier to defeat the more rescues you perform. 
 
Other levels include a skate training level, a snowball fight with bears hiding in trees, and a 
memory game with a cameo appearance by Clyde Radcliffe from the Creatures series.  Most of the levels 
have a time limit, indicated by the bird moving towards the pebble.

Winter Challenge (9871) (c) 1988 Tynesoft Computer Software / Thunder Mountain 
 
This is a winter sports game that lets you compete in five Olympic events:  Downhill skiing, 
Biathlon, Slalom, Ski Jump and Bob Sled. It is very similar to offerings like Winter Games from Epyx. 
 
In Downhill skiing, you must avoid the obstacles and make it to the bottom of the hill, by swerving 
left and right and adjusting your speed by pushing the joystick forward and back. The Slalom is 
similar, involving skiing around flags. 
 
In the ski jump, you must position the skis for a proper landing. In the bobsled event, you must 
carefully control the angles so your bobsled doesn't flip.  The Biathlon event combines skiing to 
shooting ranges and shooting the targets archery-style.

The Witch's Cauldron is a text adventure with graphics where the protagonist is turned into a slimy 
toad by the witch Hazel, apparently inspired by the classic fairy tale The Frog King. Imprisoned on 
the witch's island, the player needs to get the main character back to his original form by 
collecting ingredients and mixing them into the cauldron, with complementary adventure game puzzles. 
 
During the game, the player will transform into various creatures, such as a bat, a cat or an ape, 
while trying to regain the human form. The screen has been divided horizontally in a graphic 
representation of the scene (top) and a lower part for the text description and commands. The scenes 
are not shown from a first-person perspective. Instead, the player is able to see its form in a 
third-person view from the side, showing the current location in relation to the objects. 
 
There are about 100 rooms to explore and some puzzles require a specific form. If a shape change 
happens to quickly, it becomes possible to miss out on items.

Wiz (8638) (c) 1987 Silhouette Software / Melbourne House 
 
The good land of Midgard and the evil land of Neflheim have long been joined together by a powerful 
spell, which has long been acceptable, but now the evil is starting to seep through. As a novice 
Wizard you aim to earn enough points to become a top-level wizard and cast the spell which might 
blast the worlds apart. Unfortunately, the powerful wizards feel this is too dangerous, and will set 
out to stop you any way they can. 
 
The gameplay resembles Gauntlet, as your wizard is viewed from above and shoots bolts of magic at 
enemies. There are in fact four control modes - the other three allow you to prepare more advanced 
spells, learn them by reading the books, and buy additional spells. Spells must be prepared in 
real-time, and miscasting a spell can have disastrous effects.

The premise of the game is to run around the screen collecting various treasures for points, avoiding 
monsters.  You must find the key, which gives you the ability to cast magic spells such as fireballs 
or teleportation, and also unlocks the exit to the next level.  Each level takes up the full screen 
and has its own unique and interesting hazards, such as arrows which move you quickly and blocks 
which are removed when you step on them.  This is much more of a puzzle game than a strict 
action/arcade game, with 6 difficulty and 9 speed settings. A level designer is included.

Spook needs to escape from the King of Id's dungeons. He slips out but Turnkey is in pursuit. He 
needs to solve math problems to open the way to his escape. 
 
Wizard of Id's WizMath is an educational game to teach mathematics. Using your joystick, you must 
move blocks into place so they complete a correct math problem and answer. If you push against a 
block, you will send it flying until it hits a wall or another block. You can also face a block and 
hold down the button. While keeping the button down, you can then slide the block as needed. There is 
a sixty second time limit and you are being pursued by Turnkey. Early levels require only one math 
problem to exit but later levels require two or more. 
 
Early in the game, you can select a floor on an elevator. The higher the floor, the more difficult 
the math problems. The game also asks your age. The older you say you are, the higher a floor it 
tries to start you on, although you can select a lower floor.

The Wizard of Id's WizType is an edutainment title based on the comic strip created by artist Brant 
Parker and writer Johnny Hart. The title is designed to give keyboard novices lessons on how to 
improve their typing accuracy and speed. 
 
The game is broken into two sections: The first section pits players as the Wiz, matching wits 
against the Evil Spirit, an apparition that lives in the Wizard's vat. The Wizard must quickly type 
out the words that the Evil Spirit gives him in order to diminish the Spirit and win the round.  
Failure to spell words properly, or taking too long to spell results in the Evil Spirit morphing into 
a dragon, and singing the Wizard to a crisp. 
 
The second part of the game has the player trying to keep up with Bung the Jester.  In this segment, 
players must type out a pre-written paragraph in order to keep pace with Bung, who is hopping along 
the words on a pogo stick. 
 
WizType has multiple skill levels to match different levels of typing ability, and increases in 
challenge as players progress through their lessons.

The player controls a warrior who is trapped in a dungeon. The goal is to earn as many points as

ability to disappear temporarily. At the bottom of the screen the player has a radar which can be 
used to locate creatures that are invisible. 
 
When the the player completes a maze, a Worluk sometimes appears. This creature moves rapidly and 
will only be on the screen momentarily. If the player destroys the creature before it escapes, the 
next dungeon will become a double score dungeon and all creatures will be worth twice as many points. 
Occasionally the Wizard of Wor himself may appear! He moves quickly and can teleport around the maze. 
If they destroy him, the player will earn a large amount of points.

Wizardry II - The Knight of Diamonds (8663) (c) 1988 Sir-tech Software, Inc. / Sir-tech Software, 
Inc. 
 
The classic dungeon crawler RPG series continues in Wizardry II. The sequel to the original Wizardry 
follows the defeat of the evil Werdna and the return of Mad Overlord Trebor's amulet. Following your 
party's success in that adventure, they were inducted into Trebor's personal honor guard. 
Unfortunately this particular honor didn't last very long as Trebor's madness and obsession with the 
amulet and preventing Werdna's return drove him to suicide. 
 
With both Trebor and Werdna dead all seemed well within the kingdom of Llylgamyn. Unfortunately this 
peace didn't last very long. Besides Werdna, it seems that there was another evil fella living in 
Llylgamyn named Davalpus. With Werdna dead and out of the limelight, Davalpus felt it was time to 
make his move. He stormed the castle, slaughtered the royal family, and declared himself supreme 
dictator for life. 
 
Don't worry, this game isn't about preparing for a big final battle with Davalpus. That's already 
been done for you. The Prince of the land fought and killed Davalpus using the legendary Staff of 
Gnilda and wearing the armor of the Knight of Diamonds. Unfortunately the god Gnilda, more than a bit 
ticked off with all this bickering, took the staff back and placed it deep within his heavily guarded 
six-level temple. Since the staff's power protects the land from invasion by hostile outlanders, 
someone will need to venture into the temple and get it back along with Gnilda's blessing. That 
someone is you. 
 
In order to hold the staff one of your party members will need to retrieve all five pieces of the 
legendary armor and become the Knight of Diamonds. Only then may they quest for the staff and return 
it to it's rightful place. But beware, each of the the armor pieces is a living entities and will not 
be taken without a fight. 
 
Wizardry II uses the same basic engine and graphics as the previous game. Players have the option of 
transferring characters from the previous Wizardry, or generating new characters from scratch.

Wizardry I - Proving Grounds of the Mad Overlord (8662) (c) 1987 Sir-tech Software, Inc. / Sir-tech 
Software, Inc. 
 
The first Wizardry game was one of the original CRPG dungeon crawlers, and stands along with  Ultima 
and  Might & Magic as one of the defining staples of the genre. You generate and control a party of 
up to six different adventurers and send them into a 3D vector dungeon to fight monsters and find 
treasure. 
 
The game takes place in the domain of Trebor, the titular Mad Overlord. Trebor was once only 
power-mad, but went off the deep end after he acquired a magical amulet of immense power only to have 
it stolen from him by his nemesis the evil archmage Werdna. Werdna, not quite sure how to use the 
amulet properly, accidentally causes an earthquake which creates a ten-level dungeon beneath Trebor's 
castle. To avoid looking silly, Werdna declares the dungeon to be the new lair for him and his 
monster hordes. Trebor, not to be outdone, declares the labyrinth is in fact his new Proving Grounds 
where adventurers must prove themselves for membership in his elite honor guard (and incidentally 
retrieve his amulet in the process). Thus your goal in the game is to descend to the tenth floor of 
the labyrinth, defeat Werdna, and retrieve the fabled amulet.

Despite the defeat of Trebor, Werdna, and L'kbreth, dark times once again threaten the kingdom of 
Llylgamyn.  So once again a party of adventurers must venture forth to vanquish the evil. 
 
Wizardry V represents a complete revision of the gaming system used in the first four installments, 
with larger mazes, new spells and character classes, and an expanded system for combatting and 
interacting with creatures.  It is also the first game in the series that allows, but does not 
require characters imported from a previous scenario.

Wizard's Lair (8660) (c) 1985 Bubble Bus Software / Bubble Bus Software 
 
Building on the basic gameplay and visual ideas of Ultimate's Atic Atac, Wizard's Lair stars explorer 
Pothole Pete, who is stuck in the Lair unless he can find all four pieces of the Golden Lion. The 
game is viewed slightly top-down, with indoor rooms bordered by line drawn vectors rather than the 
fuller jungle graphics. 
 
The pace of the game is quite fast, and the challenge of the action elements is increased by not 
having infinite weaponry. The route through the game is non-linear, with multiple exits and secret 
rooms commonplace. Although the screens always contain a particular area, rather than the sections of 
different areas viewed in Atic Atac (which meant that you'd often have to work out how to reach some 
sections via other screens), a river is a central aspect of the layout, and delimits some sections of 
the screens.

Wizball (8669) (c) 1987 Sensible Software / Thunder Mountain 
 
In Wizball the player takes the role of the friendly wizard Wiz who can turn himself into a green 
ball that is able to defend his world against the color-sucking enemies who have turned his once 
brightly colored Wizworld into a drab planet. With his trusty feline companion Catelite, the wizard 
will restore the colors to the world by retrieving them from defeated enemies. 
 
The player starts out as a bouncing green ball that can shoot and be put into more or less heavy 
rotation to move slowly or faster, physically correct through the side-scrolling levels. The first 
task is to upgrade the ball by shooting the first non-moving enemies, and collect the green bubbles 
that are left by them. In order to stand a chance against the following moving enemy waves, some 
upgrades are a must. First and foremost, complete control over the ball should be activated (i.e. 
flying through the levels), a shield sheltering the top and bottom of the player's should be 
acquired, and two-way fire (left/right) should be obtained. 
 
But the extra needed to advance in Wizball is your friend Catelite who will, once summoned, take the 
form of a small green satellite that will imitate the ball's movement, or can be directly controlled 
by the player. Besides upping Wiz' fire power, Catelite is able to collect paint drops left by a 
certain kind of defeated enemies until the respective color pot is filled up. There's three colors 
available (red, green and blue), and several different combinations of them must be collected to 
complete a level and restore it to former colorfulness. Every color combination collected will send 
Wiz to a bonus stage, then to his laboratory where one of the power-ups can be made permanently. 
 
The game also features a bunch of multi-player modes, there's even a two-player cooperative mode 
amongst them.

Nerkus the Wizard has kidnapped Sherlie, and transformed her beloved Dave into an iron ball. As Dave, 
you must set off to rescue her from Nerkus’ castle, by completing the zones that guard a magic door. 
 
Wonderball is a scrolling action game in which you control the constantly bouncing Dave, guiding him 
over water hazards and spikes, and away from contact with the many meanies he will encounter, such as 
Fireflies and Gugglies. Navigating a path through the chaos often requires pixel-perfect placement, 
particularly as enemies come into play based on your position in the level, rather than based on 
time. 
 
You start with 5 Daves. Entering the yellow Underground sections lets you play a simple game of 
chance, in which lives can be gained or points gained or lost.

Wonderboy (8681) (c) 1987 Westone Co., Ltd. / Activision, Inc. 
 
Just when things were going great with Tom-Tom and his girlfriend Tanya, some thug of a woodland king 
had to kidnap her and hide her away, and Tom-Tom doesn't have a clue where. That's why he has to 
explore deep dark forests, cross endless oceans, climb treacherous slopes, survive endless volcanoes, 
and even walk through clouds. But Tom-Tom will never be totally alone. You see, when he goes through 
the exotic locations, he has to come face to face with its inhabitants, like bees, spiders, snakes, 
coal-kids, frogs, bats, snails, coyotes, and octopuses, to name a few. The hatchet is Tom-Tom's only 
line of defense against these menaces. 
 
There are ten areas, each containing four rounds each, but the tenth area can't be accessed unless 
Tom-Tom collects all the dolls during his rescue mission. During his journey, he can break open 
different eggs that will reveal hatchets, skateboards, mushrooms, milk, and even guardian angels. You 
can ride the skateboard through each round, as long as you don't collide with an inhabitant. When you 
complete each round while still riding the skateboard, you'll start the next round still riding it. 
As you progress through each round, your vitality will start to get low, but it can be increased by 
getting milk, mushrooms, potato chips,or fruit that appear everywhere you go. As well as the normal 
eggs, there are also speckled eggs that must be avoided, otherwise the God of Death will be released, 
and once he follows you, you'll lose vitality much quickly. At the end of every fourth round, there 
is a king waiting to destroy you with his fireballs or lightning bolts. 
 
There are also warp-gates, but you don't find them, they find you. You see, warp-gates appear in 
rounds 1-4 of each area. If you happen to get one fruit, a special item will appear. These special 
items include handbags, wrist watches, a pair of shoes, a teddy bear, and a bottle of perfume. 
Another girl will appear and take you up to the clouds where the object is to collect as many hearts 
as you can without falling down or getting the item again. Once you have collected all the hearts, 
you can get the item to return to the surface, and more often than not, you'll get further in the 
round.

Eleven years have gone by since Tom-Tom rescued his girlfriend Tanya from the clutches of the evil 
King. Word of Tom-Tom's dangerous adventure soon spread throughout Wonder Land. The people were very 
proud of him and gave Tom-Tom the highest honor of all - the legendary name of Wonder Boy. With the 
evil King defeated, Wonder Land returned to its peaceful state, and for over one decade, the kingdom 
was a paradise, and everything and everyone lived happily together. 
 
Eventually, the peace was broken when a ferocious fire-breathing dragon appeared out of nowhere and 
took over Wonder Land with an army of evil, monsterous henchmen, causing Wonder Land was immediately 
thrown into utter chaos. Defenseless that they were, the people were quickly taken over and the 
tranquil and serene kingdom was transformed into a land of demons and devils. Wonder Land was now a 
Monster Land. Tom-Tom was summoned to set out on a journey, destroy this dragon, and restore peace 
once again. Tom-Tom is Wonder Land's last hope. 
 
There are twelve locations in which Tom-Tom must venture through, including (but not limited to): the 
city of Wonder Land, Valley of Peace, The Coastal Town of Baraboro, The Mam Desert, and Pororo 
Islands. During his journey, he must defeat monsters with the sword that he got at the beginning of 
his adventure. These monsters will leave either gold coins or bags of cash, which he can use to buy 
better weapons, shields, armors, and boots. At the end of each location, there is usually a boss that 
Tom-Tom must defeat in order to obtain a gold key that will unlock the exit gate, as well as plenty 
of gold coins or bags of cash. If he touches any enemies, or is shot at, he will lose health. During 
his travels, Tom-Tom must take note of the hourglass

(e.g. form a three letter word, that starts with "t"). The goal is find 6 different words for each 
level, which will fill up the "word spinner", which represents a simple spinning wheel. Points are 
assigned for successful words, and every 300 points, the player is allowed to go to the prize spinner 
to select their winnings. Difficulty can be assigned between three and four letter words, and with 
different letters already embedded inside the word for the player to work with. Players are given the

World Championship Boxing Manager (8700) (c) 1990 Goliath Games / Goliath Games 
 
Manage a stable of 3 wannabe heavyweight world champions in this unusual twist of the standard 
football management style. The option are selected through an icon-based system, representing your 
office. 
 
Training your fighters involves deciding which areas they should work on, considering their strengths 
and weaknesses and any damage inflicted in previous fights, and those of their next opponent. 
 
There are 97 of these in the game, so reaching the top of the rankings will take 15-20 fights, just 
like real life. Choosing a beatable opponent, but one who can get your fight as high up the Friday 
Night bill as possible, negotiating the best financial deal, and a mutually agreeable dare, are the 
main considerations. 
 
Two different governing bodies are included in the game, each with subtly different rules, and a 
fight in one set of rules won’t be viewed quite as significantly by the other. 
 
The matches are presented from the commentary box, with the 2 expert analysts exchanging textual 
descriptions of the key punches, and who is dong the best (a clue to how any judges’ decision would 
go). Before and during the fights you can instruct your man as to what tactics to adopt.

This soccer game lets you choose a team representing one of twenty-four countries around the world to 
participate in the World Championship tournament. This is identical to the real 1990 World Cup. 
 
Once you pick your team you can also select which players you want on the field, so that you can 
round out the team's strengths and weaknesses. Also provided are modes for single exhibition matches, 
either against the computer or against a friend. 
 
The action is viewed from above with large player sprites. Violent play is encouraged as there are no 
free kicks. Whereas later sports games often carry heavy focus on the attention to detail, this game 
is rather simplified -- you can only control the player closest to the ball, for example, and it is 
missing many of the rules of soccer such as penalty flags and offsides.

In between all the fighting, there are action-sequences where you have to deflect bouncing balls etc,

World Tour Golf (8731) (c) 1987 
 
World Tour Golf lets you play over a dozen well known courses, including Augusta and Pebble Beach. A 
split screen gives you an overhead view of the hole and a 3-D view. The control uses multiple button 
presses to set pace and draw/fade - fortunately a Driving Range is included to practice on. When you 
select a club, its range is superimposed on the view, making planning shots easier. Wind, pin 
placement and even weather conditions must be considered as you play your shot.  Also included is a 
course architect for creating new courses or modifying existing ones.

Worm in Paradise (8742) (c) 1986 Level 9 Computing, Ltd. / Level 9 Computing, Ltd. 
 
Eden has been successfully colonised, by creating several domed cities. Society is rigidly 
functioning, unemployment, crime and poverty all non-existent. The economy functions on fines rather 
than taxes, making for a plethora of petty rules and no penal punishment. Robot employees make 
everything run cheaply. Body part reselling allows hospitals to turn a profit. Robots can even 
control human reproduction. The end result is a society in which humans have no useful role. Who 
would live in a 'paradise' like this? 
 
The Worm In Paradise is the culmination of the Silicon Dreams series of interactive fiction. The game 
relies on strict timing and a day/night cycle (using a decimal clock with 10 100-minute hours) – 
return to your home before darkness falls, and don't expect robots to help with tasks which will not 
be finished in the day. Vital buildings can be located using colour-coded co-ordinates, but these 
change every time you load the game, so be careful to write them down.

WWF European Rampage Tour (8759) (c) 1992 Arc Developments / Ocean Software Ltd. 
 
Ocean's second Wrestling game is tag-team-based, taking you through four fights around major European 
cities. You assemble your 2-man team from Hulk Hogan, The Ultimate Warrior, Brett 'Hitman' Hart and 
Macho Man Randy Savage. 
 
Combat takes place both in and out of the ring, although you can't spend more than 10 seconds at a 
time outside the ring. Once you stun an opponent you can throw them, which inflicts real damage to 
their energy bar. You can make lots of combination moves, including jumping off the ropes and landing 
on an opponent to pin him.

WWF Wrestlemania Challenge (8760) (c) 1991 Twilight / Ocean Software Ltd. 
 
At the height of the World Wrestling Federation's European fame came this crunching recreation of the 
elaborate hammed-up action. Hulk Hogan, The Ultimate Warrior or the British Bulldog can come under 
your control. 
 
You play either in practice matches (against the hopefully-misnamed Mr Perfect) or in a sequence of 5 
matches to win the Wrestlemania Belt. Your opponents have different special moves - watch out for The 
Warlord's Full Nelson and Sgt. Slaughter's Camel Clutch, for example. Before the fights start, your 
opponents will deliver a taunt, which you must respond to as creatively as possible. 
 
The game is a beat 'em up viewed from a forced perspective above and behind the action. Your aim is 
to pin your opponent to the ground for 3 seconds, which can only be done once he has been weakened. 
Kicks, punches and throws will reduce an opponent's strength bar. When a strong opponent is down, 
stamping on him will pay off more than attempting a pin. 
 
Avoid leaving the ring for too long - 20 seconds out and the match is void, which counts as a defeat. 
As in real WWF, the frame of the arena can be used to perform moves. Once players are in close 
contact, waggle the joystick to ensure you win the grapple.

Xeno (8780) (c) 1986 Binary Design, Ltd. / A&F&nbsp 
 
Xeno is a future sport resembling Air Hockey. Each of the two players (the second being either human 
or computer controlled) controls a ground skimmer, which is aiming to hit a puck so as to knock it 
into their opponent's goal. This is done in a turn-based manner, in which each player controls a 
movement line which sets up their intended move before it is enacted. 
 
The arena is surrounded by walls, so rebounds (of both the puck and the skimmers) have to be factored 
into your shot selection. You are not required to hit the puck with a shot, so some shots can be 
defensive-minded. You can toggle between 1 and 9 seconds for the shot time, and between 1 and 9 
minutes for the length of each of the four quarters.

asteroid. Hopefully whatever happened to the 200 personnel in the labyrinth of mines under the 
station won't happen to you too. 
 
Xenomorph is a first person RPG. Like the Dungeon Master series everything happens in real time. You 
move around in 10 foot steps and can turn 90 degrees. You have two hands to fight and use items with, 
a belt and holster for quick access to weapons as well as an inventory for carrying things. 
 
The objective of the game is to find parts to repair your ship. You must also find food and water for 
sustenance and guns, grenades and mines for self defense. Other items can help you during your 
mission such as environmental suits, security passes and a motion detector. Data disks found 
throughout the station will fill in the story.

Xenon (8783) (c) 1988 Bitmap Brothers, The / Melbourne House 
 
Xenon is the obscure and mysterious predecessor to the much better known Xenon 2: Megablast. The game 
is actually nothing like its sequel, with completely different control scheme and gameplay. The plot 
overlaps however, with the Xenites making their first attempt to control the galaxy. 
 
Xenon is essentially an overhead shooter, where the player controls the ship and moves around the 
screen. However, the difference between Xenon and its sequel is that here the player actually 
controls the movement of the playfield (up or down) by simply moving the ship in the direction of 
choice. To do this in the sequel, players need to slam your ship against the bottom of the screen and 
pull back on the stick in order to reverse-scroll the playfield. 
 
It also features a 3D playfield (some enemies, for example, will be mounted on hills of sort, where 
players can't shoot them). To combat these the player can transform its tank into a plane. The game 
then switches to the more familiar gameplay style as seen in other vertically scrolling shooters. The 
plane has to transform back into a tank again to combat most ground units. 
 
In Xenon, upgrades are taken from destroyed enemies.

Through five levels, you have to shoot countless enemies, complete with the obligatory mid-level and

new weapons - instead of simply buying upgrades, you can customize your ship by placing your new

The Xybots are out to stop you, of course, and many have advanced attack patterns as well as bullets 
to fire at you. Being able to view round corners is useful, allowing you to plan a strategy - often

A week in the life of the British Prime Minister.  But not just any Prime Minister, this game puts 
you in the shoes of Prime Minister James (Jim) Hacker from the classic BBC television comedy "Yes,

Much like most political simulations, you must balance your popularity with the needs of your party, 
the meddling of foreign governments, and the small minded incompetence of the civil servants that 
surround you.  All of this is played out with multiple choice dialogues between Hacker and the other 
cast members of the series (complete with lo-res digital pictures).  The dry humor of the show 
abounds as you must deal with crises such as the French refusing to continue work on the channel 
tunnel until Waterloo station is renamed.  Fans of the show will recognize much of the material and 
non-fans should still find enough laughs to keep them interested.

Zaga Mission is a isometric-viewed action game graphically similar to Zaxxon. The game takes place 
underground. You have to navigate your helicopter through a series of mazes. As if that wasn't enough 
the security doors are opening and closing  unpredictably. Hit any of the walls or doors and the 
mission is over. Refueling stations can be found along the way, and these are necessary so you don't

Zak McKracken is a tabloid reporter (and not a very good one at that).  Based upon a psychadelic 
dream, Zak one day realizes that something is wrong -- Space Aliens are dumbifying the general public 
through the telephone system.  Zak must stop this, but he can't do it alone.  After finding a magic 
crystal (or some sort of crystal), Zak manages to get the help of Anthropologist, Annie, and her 
friends, Melissa and Leslie.  Between the four characters (all of which you control), you can destroy 
the dumbifying devices and save the earth.  Not too bad for a tabloid reporter.

City, which is heavily protected by aircraft, guns and missiles. Many barriers are alarmed, leaving 
you with limited space to progress through, and fire must constantly be dodged. 
 
Stage two is a space shoot out against hordes of enemy aircraft - those you failed to destroy in the 
first part of the task. Complete this and you reach the final battle with Zaxxon, with the game 
looping with increased difficulty if you can survive the first time. There are 3 distinct skill 
levels, while controls involve using forward to dive and back to climb, in the manner of flight

At its most basic level, Zero Gravity can be thought of as a Pong game, as the player controls a bat 
which must be used to hit a ball as it comes towards you. The main twist is that the gameplay is 
completely 3-dimensional, with control over the horizontal and vertical positions of the bat. The 
game uses a split-screen view, with the top half from player 1's perspective, and the bottom from 
player's 2, even when only one player is human. 
 
Each time you get the ball past your opponent's bat, a score is added to a tally, and a number of 
points are awarded. Along the side-wall of the playing arena there are 8 tokens to be hit, awarding 
extra points, speeding the game up, deducting points from your opponent, and so on.

In this arcade style shooter, Zig-Zag, you are a star pilot. Maneuver your star fighter down the 
narrow passageways of Matrix of Zog somewhere in the 12th dimension. You must locate the Eight 
Crystals of Zog. To prevent you from doing this, the enemy will send their best against you. Ramps, 
traps and disappearing barriers are a few of the other obstacles in your path. Shop zones are 
available at various spots. Buy maps, shields, an extra life or two, or even infrared and x-ray 
vision. 
 
There are two modes that you are able to choose at the beginning of the game, Brain Teaser and 
Zapper. Zapper mode, all prisms in place and all passageways will be open. Use this mode to become 
familiar with the maze. However, you must shoot aliens while doing this. The Brain Teaser is the 
normal mode of the game. You will have five lives. 
 
The joystick controls your fighter up, down, left and right, its button fires your weapons. To change 
the forward direction of your ship, you must run into the prisms on the floor (or the walls). The 
prisms allow 90 degree and 180 degree turns, depending how they are oriented. Hitting a wall always 
reverses direction. 
There are three Special Zones: 
Save Zone – Entering this zone will allow you to save the game. You will be shown a special save 
code. Jot these down, since they will not be saved to disk. When you restart the game, you will be 
able to re-enter this code to begin the game in the Save Zone. 
Death Zone – Enter here and die. 
Shop Zone – Enter this zone and using the cash that you have accumulated from killing aliens purchase 
various items to help you on your quest. 
Your quest won't be easy. There are seven types of aliens that will hinder your progress. They are 
zigzags, homers, drifters, attracters, bouncers, corkscrews and cubes. Good luck.

Lots of potentially-useful items have been left behind, some stored in cupboards - work out what they 
could be used for. 
 
Try to find a weapon with which to attack the zombies - bare-hands fighting only works for a few 
attempts before your character is worn out. Dead zombies should be placed in the freezer in the 
basement to stop them re-emerging. You have free rein over the shopping mall, and can use the bed 
shops to rest and the food shops for nourishment. Be wary of the dark and zombie-filled basement 
though.

Zork I - The Great Underground Empire (8908) (c) 1983 Infocom, Inc. / Commodore Electronics Ltd. 
 
Zork: The Great Underground Empire is a classic text adventure game.  The player begins as an 
"adventurer" standing near a white house in a nice forest, but soon descends into the Great 
Underground Empire, where most of the game takes place. The player's quest is to collect the Nineteen 
Treasures of Zork. 
 
As was typical for adventure games of its era, Zork does not use graphics. Instead, it communicates 
with the player via text, and the player interacts with the game by typing commands, such as "examine 
mailbox" or "take torch". For movement, the player types in geographical directions (such as "north" 
or "east" - or just "n" and "e"), and can check what items are being carried with the "inventory" 
command (or just "i"). 
 
Zork was ported over from mainframes in the late 1970s. It is one of the first "text adventures" and 
is widely considered to be one of the great classics of the genre which reached the peak of its 
popularity in the '80s.

All the ingredients from the Zorro story feature in this action game - a kidnapped senorita, an evil

This computer version of Zorro is a strange beast, he can leap across buildings, fall 50 feet and 
land like a feather, with neither a scratch to his head or a crease in his cape. He can also perform 
masterful tricks, such as balancing a large plant pot on his head, while simultaneously climbing up a 
ladder. 
 
Zorro has similar platform gameplay to the same company's Bruce Lee game, but with a slower pace and 
more puzzle elements. There are 20 different screens in the game, with The Ole Hotel screen being 
used continually throughout the game. The player must overcome various puzzles, including the 
branding of a bull and catapulting into the air via a conveniently left spring board and a dazed 
Garcia guard!

Z (8834) (c) 1986 Rino Limited / Spinnaker Software Corporation 
 
You pilot the Z-Fighter. By cybernetic control, your brain becomes one with the ship and your every 
thought becomes motion. Destroy all attacking aliens. Fail, and the known universe will be overrun by 
the bloodthirsty aliens. A true shoot-em-up. The joystick controls all motion. Fire button fires. 
 
Destroy alien encounters and score points. The higher the level, the greater the challenge. The 
greater the challenge, the larger the points received. 
After destroying 10 aliens, an energy unit will appear. If you destroy this, you will free an energy 
capsule. Chase and collect the capsule to obtain energy bombs. 
 
Once you have gathered several energy bombs, you can blast a hole through the moving force barrier 
surrounding the Transporter Unit. Create a large enough hole and you will be able to warp through 
hyperspace to the next level. Complete all 4 levels and the universe is saved and you are a hero.

Zub (8920) (c) 1987 Binary Design, Ltd. / Mastertronic Ltd. 
 
Zub is a cartoon platform game, the first title developed by the brothers Ste Pickford and John 
Pickford as a team. In a humorous twist, every creature in the game is named Zub, including the main 
character. The player controls Zub, an alien warrior that received a mission from his Emperor Zub of 
the Zub galactic empire: to retrieve the Green Eye of Zub, a powerful artifact. 
 
Zub must ride the intergalactic elevators to reach other planets and continue the search for the Eye. 
The worlds are very empty, featuring a few platforms and sparsely populated by dangerous monsters 
called Zubs. Zub must hop to the existing platforms, position them next to each other, and keep 
jumping and alternating between them to ascend to the top of the level and move to the next planet. 
The Zubs float around the scene following the hero, trying to touch and drain some of the health 
energy, and have to be killed with the laser gun.

Zybex (8927) (c) 1988 
 
Zybex is a horizontally scrolling shoot 'em up inspired by Side Arms and Nemesis/Gradius. The players 
took control of prisoners trying to win freedom from a galactic prison. At the end of each level they 
earned a crystal, opening access to the later levels of the game. 
 
There are 16 levels in total, with numbers 2-12 immediately available after completing the first - 
the player can go through them in any order. However, levels 13-16 are locked until the player earns 
enough crystals. 
 
The weapon system is quite unique - the player constantly fires, and the fire button is simply used 
to change the current weapon. The basic weapon is the Orbiter, which the player always has. Picking 
up weapon icons increases the power of a weapon by 1 up to the maximum of power level 4. Dying 
reduces the current weapon by 1 power level, or loses it if the weapon is power 1 (with the exception 
of the Orbiter). As the weapons get more power, their fire rate becomes faster and the bullets 
stronger. The five weapons are Orbiter, 8-way (upgrades from 2 to 4 to 6 to 8 way fire), Railgun 
(powerful single bullet which gets longer) Pulse (fires straight forward and gains diagonal fire at 
power 3/4) and Wall (another forward fire, which gains size).

This horizontally-scrolling shoot 'em up features 16 levels and 450 screens of Nemesis-inspired 
action. You pilot a spacecraft through the levels, shooting as many of the encroaching meanies and 
mounted turrets as possible. Power-up tokens are offered for shooting some, which can be used to 
obtain better weapons including ground-attack lasers, speed ups and multiple bullets. Extra lives are 
on offer as well, which you'll certainly need, especially as you have to go back a long way when 
losing a life.
