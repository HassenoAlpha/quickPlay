Minigame Combo 2005 Multi Cart (c) Nov, 2005 
 
This cartridge contains six of the 1 kilobyte entries and one 4 kilobyte entry from the 2005 Minigame 
Competition with an onscreen menu for selecting the games. The games are: 
 
1. Hunchy: inspired by the Century Electronics game Hunchback, the player takes the role of 
   Quasimodo and must rescue Esmeralda from the cathedral of Notre Dame. Quasimoto can jump across 
   the roof, avoiding guards and assorted missiles. 
 
2. Jetman: inspired by the 8-bit computer game Jetpac, the player must fuel a rocket but avoid 
   getting shot from an unseen attacker. 
 
3. Nightrider: the player is running from a hostile government. They are pursuing you with a 
   helicopter. Just keep running and watch out for the terrain. The farther and longer along the 
   Nightrider goes, the more freedom is worth. 
 
4. Zirconium: an alien race, not carbon-based but zirconium-based, have invaded the galaxy. They 
   have set space mines to protect their mothership. The player takes the role of Captain Joe 
   Diamond, and must fight his way through these mines and destroy the mothership. Careful about 
   hitting mines, as the ship can only take so many blows. Grab any power packs you can. 
 
5. Rocket Command: magma beings are invading from the inside of a volcano. As the rocket 
   commander, the player must destroy these beings' ships before they launch into the sky. 
 
6. M-4: a port of a 1977 Midway arcade game of the same name. The player has unlimited lives and 
   90 seconds to destroy all that is seen for points. Points are awarded for hitting the wall, the 
   opponent tank, a car and an airplane. If the player or the opponent are hit, the wall is rebuilt 
   and both are returned to thier starting points, but the clock never pauses. 
 
7. Marble Jumper: this is a puzzle game where the object is to clear the board of all but 1 
   marble, with the last one being in the middle. There are 33 squares and 16 marbles. The player 
   clears marbles by jumping them vertically or horizontally, like in checkers. Diagonal jumps are 
   not allowed.

3-D Brickaway (c) 1983 Avalon Hill / Avalon Hill 
 
This is a racquetball-like game that is best described as a 3D variation of Breakout. 
 
You are at the end on a rectangular room. On the other end is a wall made of bricks or blocks. The 
ball travels down to the wall and knocks out a brick. It then returns to your end where you must use 
a squarish paddle to send the ball back to the wall. If the ball gets past the paddle, you lose a 
ball. 
 
In the computer version, you must knock out all the bricks of the wall to advance. Each level has 
more bricks per wall. You begin with 5 balls. 
In the console version, you must knock out 57 of the 72 bricks to advance. Each level has 72 bricks 
but the number of balls will lower in later levels. Level 1 starts with 99 balls.

Decathlon (1983) (Activision) (c) 1983 Activision, Inc. / Activision, Inc. 
 
The Activision Decathlon is a series of Olympic games similar to the Epyx games series. Up to four 
players can compete in the ten different events of a real-life decathlon, either in sequence or 
individually. Included are the 100-meter dash, long jump, shot put, high jump, 400-meter race, 
110-meter hurdles, discus throw, pole vault, javelin throw, and 1500-meter race. 
 
The flat running events involve simple joystick waggling, which must be balanced with 
accurately-timed button presses to clear the hurdles - hitting them or breaking stride causes a loss 
of momentum and thus time. For jumping and throwing events, you must build momentum by waggling and 
then press the button to throw or jump at what you feel is the appropriate moment. 
 
For each event, points are earned based on how well you do (this can be based on your running time, 
or how far you throw the javelin or discus, etc...), and the player with the most points at the end 
of the decathlon wins the gold medal.

Adventure (1978) (Atari) (c) 1980 Atari, Inc. / Sears, Roebuck and Co. 
 
A graphic dungeon quest inspired by the old mainframe game of the same name, Adventure is a graphic 
adventure where you use your joystick to wander around, collecting keys to explore castles, 
labyrinths and everything in between, whilst slaying anything that moves (i.e. Dragons & Co.) to get 
treasures. 
 
The game has 3 difficulty settings: 
 
1. Level 1 (Easiest) 
2. Level 2: The Kingdom is larger than Level 1, containing secret rooms and hidden items to add 
   difficulty. 
3. Level 3 (Hardest): Similar to Level 2 but all objects/items are placed randomly throughout the 
   Kingdom. 
 
Gameplay revolves around picking up (and dropping) items, hacking your way though dragons, finding 
keys to open the castle gates and using magic (i.e. reincarnation) in case you get swallowed by 
failing-to-follow-their-diet-plan-dragons.

The object of this game is to defend the buildings at the bottom of the screen. 
 
There are four types of attacking ships moving down the screen. You are moving just above the 
buildings. The enemies are dropping bombs to try to damage your buildings or destroy you. You must 
fire missiles up to destroy them. The waves of enemies never ends. 
 
The game ends when all three of your ships are destroyed or when both buildings have taken so much 
damage that they collapse. 
 
There are eight game variations. Some where the ships move side-to-side while moving down, some where 
your shots move to the side when you do, some faster and some with combinations of any or all of 
these.

Air-Sea Battle (1977) (Atari) (c) 1977 Atari, Inc. / Atari, Inc. 
 
Air-Sea Battle is basically a target shooting game.  On most settings, you are positioned at the 
   bottom of the screen and you shoot at targets at the top of the screen.  The various settings 
   provide different targets and weapons with different characteristics. 
 
In games 1-6, you are an anti-aircraft gun and you shoot, unsurprisingly, at aircraft.  You are 
stationary.   Your control is limited to selecting the time of firing, the angle at which your shot 
is fired and, on some settings, exertion of minor control over the direction of your missile. 
 
In games 7-12, you are a submarine and you shoot torpedoes at the ships above.  On these settings you 
are able to move your submarine back and forth across the bottom of the screen.  Your torpedoes, 
however, can only be fired directly above.  Some settings allow minor control over the direction of 
your torpedo once fired. 
 
In games 13-15, you are apparently the anti-aircraft gun again.  This time, however, you are shooting 
at shooting gallery targets (clown faces, ducks, rabbits).  The controls are as in games 1-6. 
 
In games 16-18, you are a ship and you fire polaris missiles at jets flying above.  Your ship 
constantly moves on its own, you control only the speed.  When you fire, the angle of the missile and 
its speed are based on the speed your ship was traveling at the time of firing. Some settings 
restrict your ability to change speed once a missile is fired, others allow you to exert control over 
the missile by changing speed once the missile is fired. 
 
In games 19-21, the situation is reversed, you are the jet dropping bombs at the ships below.  The 
controls in this setting are the same as in games 16-18.  The difference, of course, is that you are 
dropping bombs from above at targets below. 
 
In Games 22-27, one player is the jet and the other is the ship. 
 
Each of the two player games is a matter of who can hit more targets in (oddly enough) 2 minutes and 
16 seconds.  (The manual says that the game will also end if one player hits 99 targets.  I have yet 
to see this happen.)  In each of the single player games, the single player tries to outscore a 
computer opponent that simply constantly fires.

Alien (1982) (20th Century Fox) (c) 1982 Fox Video Games, Inc. / Fox Video Games, Inc. 
 
In this game based, loosely, on the movie of the same name, you have to move through a maze (the 
halls of your ship in the manual), ala Pac-Man, collecting dots (destroying alien eggs). 
 
If you collect the power dot (pulsar), you can kill any of the three aliens, for a short time. There 
are only three enemies in the maze at a time, there is a bonus item at times and only one power dot 
(pulsar) at a time. When you grab the pulsar, it will next appear in one of two other spots. 
 
After you clear one level, you get a bonus game. You have to move up the screen to the prize at the 
top past several aliens, reminiscent of Freeway. You do not lose a man if you fail but you only have 
eight seconds to do it then you are off the the next, harder level.

Alligator People (1983) (20th Century Fox) (c) Apr 24, 2003 
 
This game is based on a 1959 20th Century Fox horror/sci-fi movie of the same name. You are Jane 
Marvin. Your finance and five of your friends are turning into alligators due to a failed medical 
experiment. You must get the alligator antidote to cure them. 
 
You, as a syringe, must move about the screen, gathering antidotes and serums. Serums supposedly 
increase the strength of the antidote so you need less to cure someone. You must then aim at the 
infected person at the top or bottom of the screen and press your button to inject them. The longer 
you take to get the antidote to them, the more they will mutate and the more antidote it will require 
to cure them. Everything is not so simple, however, as there are normal alligators in the swamp and 
you will lose you a life if they touch you. You can shoot to kill them and it will not cost you an 
antidote. 
 
Some variations have walls that move. These make it harder to see the alligators, antidotes and 
serums. Serums only appear in variations with walls. Some variations allow you to pass through the 
walls, others will make the walls solid and they can crush you if you get between two closing ones. 
Once you cure all six friends, it is off to the next level.

Armor Ambush (aka Armor Battle) is a two player game, where each player is in command of two tanks 
(one at a time), and they must try to destroy each other.

Asteroids (1981) (Atari) (c) 1981 Atari, Inc. / Atari, Inc. 
 
Asteroids is a conversion of the arcade game of the same name. 
 
Play the role of a spaceship pilot trapped in a gigantic asteroid cloud and pulverize incoming 
asteroids with the ship's photon cannon.  When all asteroids are destroyed, the play can them move to 
the next round. In addition to asteroid, the player will also face an Alien Robot Saucer which shoots 
randomly across the screen. 
 
The player using the controller may rotate the ship (left or right) to any direction or move the ship 
forward. Shots will be fired according to the ship direction. The player has three reserved ships 
available to replace a destroyed spaceship. The spaceship is destroyed if an asteroid collides with 
the spaceship or is shot by an Alien Robot Saucer. Additionally, the player may opt to use the 
hyperspace warp to avoid collision. The warp however, may also destroy the spaceship in the process. 
 
Asteroids when shot will break-up into smaller pieces or be destroyed.. There are three types of 
asteroids: large asteroids, medium asteroids, and small asteroids. Large asteroids and medium 
asteroids when shot, will break-up into two smaller sized asteroids. Small asteroids when shot will 
be destroyed. 
 
Alien Robot Saucers come in two sizes: small and large. Both use photon lasers to shoot and will 
explode when destroyed. Alien Robot Saucers will not appear at the Novice Level. 
 
Game Difficulty and Variations 
There are 4 available difficulty settings: Novice, Intermediate, Advanced, and Expert. 
 
The game also offers three different game variations: 
 
1. Standard Play - For one or two players, taking turns when a player's ship is destroyed. 
 
2. Competition Asteroids - Two players appear on the screen at the same time. Friendly fire is in 
   affect, which means shots fired from one player's spaceship will destroy the other player's 
   spaceship. Each player has separate ship reserves. 
 
3. Team Asteroids - Two players on the screen at the same time. Friendly fire is disabled, which 
   means shots fired from one player's spaceship will not destroy the other player's spaceship and 
   just pass through. Ship reserves for both players are combined. 
 
Scoring 
The score of the Player 1 is viewable on the upper left side of the screen, while Player 2 on the 
opposite upper right side. A player will be awarded a new reserve ship for every 10,000 points. 
 
1. Small saucer - 1,000 points 
2. Other player's ship - 500 points 
3. Large saucer - 200 points 
4. Small asteroid - 100 points 
5. Medium asteroid  - 50 points 
6. Large asteroid - 20 points

Santa's reindeer have gotten lost and he must find them. The problem is that while he was an

shape today, that shape is a sphere. He's not as young as he once was and doesn't have the stamina he 
once had. 
 
You must get through four levels, each faster and trickier than the last. You must leap obstacles in 
levels in the North Pole, frozen tundra, the suburbs and the city. You must also gather items to keep 
up your energy. Some obstacles, such as elves, will help you and some, such as lightning in the city, 
will hinder you.

Toyshop elves Patrick, Quincy, and Robert painted all Santa's toys in record time and won a trip to 
the Bahamas. Unfortunately, they painted all the toys grey. It's now your job to clean up their mess, 
which means properly painting the toys in time for Santa's departure Christmas Eve. 
 
As toys scroll by on the conveyor belts, you must paint them the correct color. Some will require two 
colors to be applied and some will need two colors applied in the correct order. Not to put unwanted 
pressure on you but you must meet a minimum toy quota before the whistle blows to end you shift. Good 
luck, Santa and the children are counting on you.

This is the 2007 holiday cartridge from AtariAge. This year the cartridge, dubbed Stella's Stocking, 
contains five games. 
 
Stay Frosty: 
You are a snowman at the North Pole. One of the Christmas lights on Santa's barn, where he stores the 
reindeer dust that makes reindeer fly, has shorted and started a fire. You have to put out the fires 
but be careful because if your temperature goes up, you'll start to melt and get all wishy-washy. 
 
Elf Dash: 
You are Holly the Elf. Santa is on his way, the warehouse is locked up and the year-end blowout 
starts in ten minutes. Suddenly, Ben the Elf bursts in and says Mrs. Claus demands that the 
decorations be changed for the party. He hands you a list. Great! These things are scattered about 
the warehouse. You need to guide Holly about to gather the needed things in time or its stable 
cleaning for Holly. 
 
Cold War: 
This, quite simply, is a snowball fight between snowmen. Grab you snowball, take aim and knock his 
block off. 
 
Grandma's Revenge: 
Grandma got run over by a reindeer so now that she's recovered, she's out for revenge. Guide Grandma 
about the screen in her car to run over the reindeer. 
 
Tossing Cookies: 
It's Christmas Eve and the reindeer have flown off. As if that wasn't bad enough, it is a stormy 
night. You, as Santa, must guide your sleigh about, gathering the magical cookies that make the 
reindeer fly, while avoiding lightning. You then use these cookies to lure the reindeer back to the 
North Pole.

Atari Video Cube (1982) (Atari) (c) 1982 Atari, Inc. / Atari, Inc. 
 
In this game, you control Marvin the Cube Master. You move him around a six-sided cube with nine 
squares to a side. 
The object is to get all nine sides to be one color each in the least amount of time or fewest moves, 
depending on the game variation you select. 
 
Marvin changes a space's color by standing on it and you pressing the fire button. Marvin will then 
exchange the color he is with the space. Marvin cannot move onto a space of the same color as he is. 
 
To rotate the cube, just move to the edge and press the joystick in the direction to rotate. 
 
The game variations allow for normal or fast speed or timed race or fewest moves. 
Other variations cause the cube to show all the spaces as black except when it rotates, so you don't 
know what color your on. 
Two of the game variations, one a timed race and the other a fewest moves challenge, restrict you 
rotations to up and right only, but do not black out the spaces. 
 
Eight of the game variations have the computer play the game itself.

in the sky but then progressively lower. If an enemy makes it low enough before you destroy it, it 
will use it's weapons and destroy one of the buildings in Atlantis. As you progress in the game, the 
enemy craft will keep increasing in speed. The game ends when all remaining buildings in the city 
have been destroyed.

Backfire (2003) (Homebrew) (c) Sep 22, 2003 
 
The year is 2947. Earth is being invaded by the evil K’caj clan from the Yenrut galaxy. You are 
Galactic Commander Frank Drexor. The United States Space Guard has commissioned you with the task of 
defending the most important sector of the galaxy from the invaders. K’caj technology is much more 
advanced than the technology of Earth. Some of the ships have tractor beams. Others are equipped with 
subspace energy disruptors. These disruptors create energy barriers that will actually cause the 
shots from your cannons to reflect back at you! If your mission is a failure, the K’caj will gain 
control of this vital sector of space, allowing them to maneuver their troops and equipment much more 
efficiently and gain a larger foothold in the battle for the planet. This would certainly spell 
disaster for the citizens of Earth. Their fate is in your hands! 
 
You have a gun on the top of the screen and one on the bottom, each of which travel left or right. To 
switch between weapons, just press the joystick up or down. You must be careful when you fire because 
if you shoot your own gun, you will lose a life. There is a yellow spaceship that starts on the row 
next to the middle row and moves across the screen. Each time it reaches the screen, it moves one row 
closer to one side. If it gets to your gun, you lose as life. Later in the game, barriers appear in 
the playing field. You must be careful when these are there as they will reflect your gun's shots 
back, losing you a life if they hit. In the center, at times, there is a UFO colored either red, blue 
or green. The red is worth one-hundred points, the blue grants and extra life and the green resets 
the difficulty to level one without removing the points. Play simply continues until you lose all 
your lives.

Backgammon (1978) (Atari) (c) 1979 Atari, Inc. / Atari, Inc. 
 
This is the game backgammon and its variant, acey deucey. For backgammon, the standard rules are 
used. As they are long and complex, if you want to see those rules, look in this manual. 
 
Acey Deucey was a variation created by sailors in the U. S. Navy. As such, the rules for acey deucey 
will vary from ship to ship and person to person. For Atari, this is the variation used here: 
All pieces start out on the central Bar and can be entered at any time with the roll of the dice. 
No piece NEEDS to be moved from the bar first, even if it was hit and sent to the bar. 
A roll of 1-2 (acey deucey) allows a player to choose whichever doublet s/he wants, after making the 
1-2 move. 
After moving the doublets, the player is awarded another dice roll. 
If, after moving your doublet, the other dice roll is 1-2, you can move the 1-2 and choose another 
doublet. 
 
Difficulty switches 
Right: 
A=computer rolls dice for you 
B=you can roll real dice and dial in the numbers 
Left: 
A=computer sets up the board for you 
B=you can set the pieces where you want them. 
 
Game variations 
Games 1, 3, 5, and 7 are one player 
Games 2, 4, 6, and 8 are two player 
 
Games one through four are backgammon 
Games five through eight are acey deucey 
 
Games 1, 2, 5, and 6 have a doubling cube.

Bank Heist (1983) (20th Century Fox) (c) 1983 Fox Video Games, Inc. / Fox Video Games, Inc. 
 
You are a bank robber, driving around a maze of streets (representing the city) in a 1930's style 
car.  Your purpose is clear: perform "bank heists" by driving across white-pillared symbols that 
represent banks.  As you "rob" each of the banks, they disappear, and a police car appears in its 
place, beginning hot pursuit after a few moments.  You must avoid the cops to stay alive.  
Fortunately you are not completely defenseless, as you have a stock of dynamite, which you can 
strategically drop to destroy the cop cars. 
 
Besides the escape tunnel that will take you from one side of the screen to another (as in Pac-Man), 
there is an additional tunnel that represents the road out of town.  By taking it, you will find 
yourself in the next city.  Each city is increasingly difficult, and the cop cars are faster and 
smarter. 
 
There are 9 banks in each town, and you receive an increase in gasoline each time you rob one.  
Therefore, the goal of the game is to drive from town to town, navigating the mazes of streets, and 
robbing as many of the banks in each town as you are able to.  This keeps your gas supply high, and 
the money rolling in!  If you run out of gas, the game is over.

scrolls by horizontally. Your goal is to fly through a set number of barns in the shortest amount of 
time possible. Several obstacles will appear in your way, including flocks of geese, windmills, and 
weather vanes. Crashing into any of these will cause you to lose speed which will increase your 
overall time. There are several difficulty levels included which will require that you fly through 
anywhere from 10 to 25 barns.

Basic Math (1977) (Atari) (c) 1977 Atari, Inc. / Sears, Roebuck and Co. 
 
A very simple math game for kids. 
 
Each game of Basic Math gives the player a set of ten basic math problems (i.e. simple addition, 
subtraction, multiplication or division) to solve. The player is presented with two numbers and a 
function, and inputs the answer by cycling through numbers with the joystick. A timer option is 
available to ramp up the difficulty.  The game has eight primary game settings - basically two 
settings for each mathematical function.  Games 1 - 4 allow you to select one of the numbers you will 
be working with, while 5 - 8 give random questions. 
 
Hint: For division problems that have a remainder make sure to put a space between the whole number 
and the remainder, which goes to the right.

Atari Games' 3D tank game was ground-breaking when released to the arcades, and as such was converted 
officially to many systems. Earth has been invaded, and you and your tank lead the defensive effort. 
You drive around the battlefield from a first-person view, targeting and firing at tanks, planes and 
UFOs. You have a radar to help you see where the enemies are in direction and distance. Objects can 
be used as strategic cover. Controls simulate the tracks of a tank realistically, so the direction 
and speed settings are varied - combining forward right and backward left movements (as you can on 
keyboard versions) sees you change direction more quickly.

Big Bird wants to win the county fair egg contest and you can help him. 
 
A chicken at the top will lay and egg and it will go down a chute. You must get Big Bird under the 
correct chute to catch the egg. 
 
Game one is one player only. Games two through ten are one or two player. All games have two rounds. 
 
Game one is a practice round. There are two chickens, straight chutes and when you move Big Bird left 
or right, he pops right under the chute. 
 
Games two and three have three then four chutes and the game gets faster in the second round. Game 
two's chutes are straight, game three's zig-zag. Big Bird still pops under a chute. 
 
Games four, five and six have three rounds. There will be eleven white eggs dropped and one golden 
egg. Games four starts with two zig-zagging chutes in the first round and four in the second. Game 
five has two crisscrossing chutes in the first round, four in the second. Game six has four 
crisscrossing chutes in both rounds. Big Bird  no longer pops under the chute but must be positioned 
correctly. 
 
Games seven has eleven white eggs and one golden egg dropping per round with unlimited rounds. There 
are five broken eggs on the bottom left and you do rounds until you miss so many eggs you are out of 
broken eggs. when you catch the golden egg, in addition to points, you get an extra broken egg. 
 
Game eight is the same as game seven except you can't see an egg in the chute, only when it pops out 
the bottom. 
 
Games nine and ten are the same as game seven but the chutes shrink up in the direction of the hens. 
This means you must memorize when the chute comes out for which chicken. In game nine, the chutes are 
all the same for each round. In game ten, the patterns change per round. 
 
Each white egg caught is worth one point, each golden egg, five. 
 
For ages three to seven.

place it on the blue print. When all parts have been located, press the start button and the machine

you enter a house which doesn't contain a part, you will instead be stuck with a bomb. You will need 
to hurry and diffuse any bombs in the bomb pit before they explode! From time to time, a flower pot 
will fall from above and then hop off the screen. Get hit by a flower pot, and you lose a life. You 
also need to be careful of Fuzzy Wuzzy, who wanders around the neighborhood randomly. An encounter 
with Fuzzy Wuzzy will also be deadly! Hiding in the bomb pit is Sneaky Pete

Boing! (1983) (First Star Software) (c) 1983 First Star Software, Inc. / First Star Software, Inc. 
 
This is a game rather reminiscent of Q*bert. 
 
In this game, you are a bubble named, with great originality, Bubble. 
The object here is to bounce on each of the thirty-six squares and turn them all on. You start at the 
bottom left. On the bottom right starts the Bubble Eater. He will chase you around the play field and 
if he catches you, you lose one of your five lives. Pin starts at the top of a row and moves down. If 
you are hit by Pin, you pop and a life is lost. 
 
The good thing about Pin, other than that it doesn't actively chase you, is that if it lands on the 
Bubble Eater, it will pop it, too. When the Bubble Eater is popped, it turns into a glowing puddle 
for a short time. While it is a puddle, you can bounce on it without getting hurt. 
 
Game variations 
The game select switch just lets you start on levels one, two or three. 
 
Levels 
There are 5 waves per level. 
Level 1: The Bubble can bounce on any square and it will turn on and stay on. 
Level 2: The same as level 1 but all the squares of a horizontal row must be turned on before you go 
to another row. 
Level 3: The same as level 1 but you must turn on horizontal rows 2, 4 and 6 before you turn on rows 
1, 3 or 5. 
Level 4: The Bubble can bounce on any square and turn it on, but if you bounce on it again it turns 
off then you must bounce on it once more to turn it on again. 
Level 5: The same as level 4 but all the squares of a horizontal row must be turned on before you go 
to another row. 
Level 6: The same as level 4 but you must turn on horizontal rows 2, 4 and 6 before you turn on rows 
1, 3 or 5. 
 
Scoring 
You get 300 points the first time a Bubble Eater is popped in a wave. 
You score points each time you turn on a step. In levels 4 to 6, you get points even if you are 
turning on a step a repeatedly. 
You get points for completing a level and/or wave. The amount varies by what level or wave you 
completed.

entire wall one brick at a time! To do this, you control a paddle at the bottom of the screen which 
is used to reflect a bouncing ball into the bricks. When the ball hits a brick, it will destroy it. 
You start with five balls, and the game ends when all five fall off the bottom of the screen. Also 
included are several game variations, including breakthru (the ball will go straight through bricks 
instead of bouncing back), timed breakout (you have a time limit to gain as many points as you can), 
and invisible breakout (the bricks are only visible for a short while after one of them is hit).  
Other variations allow you to catch the ball or control the direction of the ball.

Bridge (1981) (Activision) (c) 1980 Activision, Inc. / Activision, Inc. 
 
Bridge is, of course, a computerized bridge game for one player. The computer controls both your 
partner and your opponents, either of which can be set to an expert or novice skill level. In the 
novice game, you will be able to see your partners hand while bidding while in the expert game your 
partners hand remains hidden. For each game, you can choose to play to either 13, 21, 25, or 29 
points. After a hand is finished, you have the option of replaying the same hand if you want to 
practice, or you can have the computer deal a new hand. If you don't like the way a hand is going, 
you have the option of restarting the hand to try again. Included with the game instructions is a 
complete guide to how your computer partner will bid in different situations in order to help you 
form your strategy. Bridge was designed for people who already know how to play the game, it won't 
teach you how to play.

Bugs has stolen carrots from Elmer. Elmer's hound found that scwewy wabbit and dug him up. Now, Bugs 
need to dive back into his rabbit hole to avoid getting a cotton-tail full of buckshot. 
 
You have three levels on the screen. You must select a level then press your button to steal the 
carrot. Once the carrot is stolen, Elmer's hound will dig where the carrot was, forcing you to come 
above ground. You must then make your way to the hole the hound dug and dive in to safety before 
Elmer blasts you. Once you have cleared all three levels, it is on to the next screen. If Elmer 
shoots you three times, the game is over. In a two player game, one player is Bugs, the other is 
Elmer.

Bump 'N' Jump (1983) (Mattel) (c) 1983 Data East Corporation / Mattel Electronics 
 
Bump 'N' Jump is an action racing game played from a top down point of view. As you race through the 
treacherous and ever changing roadways, the numerous enemy cars will be trying to bump you off the 
road. You need to make sure you bump the cars out of the way before you get bumped and crash into the 
sides yourself! Your car also has the ability to jump quite high if you have enough speed. This is 
useful to jump over enemy cars if there are too many in the way, and must also be used to jump gaps 
in the roadway and other highway obstacles. As the levels progress, the road becomes narrower with 
more obstacles in the way, and the other cars increase in number and in aggressiveness.

Burgertime (1982) (Mattel) (c) 1982 Data East Corporation / Mattel Electronics 
 
You play as Chef Pepper and your goal is to make giant hamburgers while evil eggs, sausages and 
pickles chase you around the game area. 
 
To properly make a hamburger you must assemble all of the ingredients together, dropping them from 
higher up onto the the burger area below. To actually do this you have to let Chef Pepper step all 
over the burger ingredients. As soon as an ingredient (a piece of lettuce for instance) has been 
stepped on, it will fall to the next level below. Falling food will squish any enemy following you 
and will also"bump" any other ingredient bellow it farther down. Also, as an emergency defense 
against the enemy food, you can collect pepper shakers which will allow you to puff out a small 
pepper cloud which will momentarily stun enemies, allowing you to walk past them. 
 
Higher levels result in new level design, faster enemies and more ingredients to assemble. 
 
The PlayStation 2 version is a port of the original arcade game and comes with a soundtrack disc, a 
DVD, a guide book and some other bonuses.

the canyon and destroying as many blocks as possible. The player with the highest score at the end of 
the game wins. 
 
This game is extremely limited in that it is played using only the paddle controller's fire button. 
You do not control the movement of the planes and helicopters, but rather you must time your shots to 
do the most damage. 
 
The cartridge includes a secondary variation titled "Sea Bomber" that is a little more interactive. 
In this game, you deploy bombs onto seafaring ships, but this time you can use the paddle 
controller's knob to determine the depth of the bombs.

Centipede (1982) (Atari) (c) 1982 Atari, Inc. / Atari, Inc. 
 
In Centipede, the player is trapped in the Enchanted Forest. Armed with only a magic wand to ward off 
the forest's insect denizens, all of which apparently are attacking in the player in continuous 
waves. 
 
The player must use the magic wand to shoot sparks at approaching insects to score points by pressing 
the controller button. Holding down the controller button will set the wand to rapid fire shots. If 
the player is bitten by an insect, the player will be temporarily paralyzed and lose one of the three 
starting magic wands. 
 
Insect Opponents and Mushrooms 
All enemy insects have a distinctive sound before attacking, which may help the player identify which 
insect is attacking. Enemies and objects in the game are as the following: 
 
1. The Centipede 
The Centipede will attack in 12 waves. In the first wave, the Centipede will have a head attached to 
11 body segments. In the second wave, the Centipede will have a head attached to 10 body segments, in 
addition to a detached head. The third wave will have the Centipede with an attached head, 9 body 
segments, plus two detached heads. These body segments will transform into heads and continue to do 
so until Wave 12. In the last wave, the Centipede will have 12 detached heads, independently 
attacking the player. Centipede heads are worth more points than body segments. 
 
Attacks from the Centipede will come from the top of the screen, moving downward. If a spark hits any 
part of the Centipede, that particular body segment will transform into a mushroom, while the body 
segment behind it will become the new Centipede head. When the Centipede is destroyed, it will 
briefly disappear and re-appear from the top of the screen again. 
 
The Spider 
The Spider will attempt to distract the player from attacking the Centipede. It will destroy any 
mushroom it touches. Spiders will score more points if it is hit in closer distances. 
 
The Flea 
The Flea will appear if the player has destroyed most of the existing mushrooms. It will drop down 
creating a new batch of mushrooms where it falls. The Flea will disappear after two hits. After the 
first hit, the Flea will drop down much faster. 
 
The Scorpion 
The Scorpion will appear in the third wave. It moves slowly but will pick up speed, moving faster. 
While doing so, it will poison any mushroom it touches. 
 
Mushrooms 
Mushrooms fill the Enchanted Forest and may act as obstacles or cover for the player, with added 
effects to enemy insects. It takes for shots to complete destroy a mushroom. There are two type of 
mushrooms: Magic Mushrooms and Poisonous mushrooms. Magic mushrooms are the default mushrooms in the 
game and are also the the result of the player destroying an insect or Centipede body segment. 
Poisonous Mushrooms are the result of the Scorpion touching a mushroom. Poisonous Mushrooms will 
prompt the Centipede near it to move straight towards the player through any mushroom. Losing a wand 
will restore any partially damaged mushroom. 
 
Game Difficulty and Variations 
The game offers four difficulty levels: Novice, Standard, Advanced, and Expert. Game Variations are 
as the following: 
 
1. One Player 
Two Player Alternating 
Two players will take turns when the active player is bitten. 
Dual Player Competition 
Two players will appear on the screen at the same time. Scoring is separate. Shots fired from one 
player will paralyze the other player. 
Team Play 
Two players will appear on the screen at the same time. Scoring is combined. Shots fired from one 
player will not paralyze the other player. 
 
Scoring 
The player will win a bonus magic wand for every 12,000 points to a maximum of six wands. The game 
will end when all wands are lost. Scoring are as the following: 
 
Centipede Head - 100 points 
Centipede Body Segment - 10 points 
Spider at close range - 900 points 
Spider at medium range - 600 points

Chase the Chuckwagon (1983) (Spectravideo) (c) 1983 Spectravision / Spectravision 
 
Released as part of a promotional campaign for Purina Dog Chow, Chase the Chuck Wagon puts players in 
control of Chuckie the Dog. Chuckie must be guided through a maze, avoiding objects and the 
dogcatcher, to the top of the screen where he can go directly beneath the chuck wagon to catch it. 
 
Escaping from the maze allows Chuckie to enter a Reward Screen.  Here, Chuckie can find a bowl of dog 
food in the maze to eat for extra bonus points.  If Chuckie misses, no points will be awarded, and he 
will simply be sent to the next screen. 
 
Chase the Chuck Wagon was available only as an exclusive through Ralston-Purina.

China Syndrome (1982) (Spectravideo) (c) 1982 Spectravision / Spectravision 
 
The Spectra Island reactor provides power for millions of residents. Ordinarily, there is no problem 
but there has been an earthquake. This has damaged the reactor, causing it to release radioactive 
particles. You must use the robot arm to retrieve these particles before the radiation builds too 
much and we have a meltdown. 
 
There are three sections per screen. They are colored, from top to bottom, red, blue and yellow. You 
start with one particle in each area and you must move the robot arm to intercept these particles, 
pushing the fire button to grasp them when they get to the robot arm. 
 
If you delay to long, however, the particles will split as they bounce around, causing the radiation 
level to build. If the radiation builds too much, you lose one robot arm. In later levels, you also 
must avoid hitting the circulating fans, as this will also destroy the robot arm. The game ends when 
you clear level nine and save the day or lose your last robot arm and the reactor enters meltdown.

time a clown pops a balloon, the balloon will disappear and you score points. 
Each player receives five clowns or turns. If you fail to catch a clown on the teeter-totter he will 
crash and disappear from the playfield. Press the controller button and another clown will bounce off 
the trampoline from the right or left corner of the playfield. After five clowns have crashed the 
game is over. The clowns may land on any point on the teeter-totter except where the other clown is

In Codebreaker your goal is to guess a 3 or 4 digit secret code which is generated by either the 
computer or another player. Depending on the difficulty setting, the player has either 8 or 12 
guesses to figure out the code by entering in values with the keyboard controller. After each guess, 
the computer analyzes your input and displays results which indicate if you have a correct digit in 
the correct position, a correct digit in the wrong position, or no correct digits at all. Points are 
scored based on how many turns it takes to correctly identify the code. A second game variation 
called Nim is also included. In this game, two players take turns removing items from a stack. On 
each turn, a player must take at least one item from a stack, and the player who removes the last 
item from the screen wins. You can have the computer set up the stacks automatically or set them up 
manually, and a variation is included where the player who removes the last item from the screen 
loses rather than wins.

Mayday! Mayday! This is Colony 7! We are under attack by the Jarvians! Defensive shield has been 
raised. We will do what we can to survive. 
 
This is an Atari 2600 port of a 1981 Taito arcade game. The Jarvian have attacked. You must defend 
Colony 7. You are manning the defensive guns that defend the colony. The Jarvians will send wave 
after wave to try to break through the colony's defense shield and/or destroy the defense cannons. 
The defense laser fires non-stop so you just need to use the joystick to place the cross hair over an 
enemy to kill them. If the enemies get to be too much, press fire to activate the Mega Blaster and 
destroy all the enemies on the screen.. Be advised that you only have three shots for the Mega 
Blaster. If the colony or cannons are destroyed, the game is over. 
 
The Jarvian ships are: 
 
1. The Fighter: This is the most common and several attack at once, firing at the shield and 
   colony and, sometimes, your cannon. 
 
2. The Advisor: This will cause the Fighters to target faster so remove it as soon as you can. 
 
3. The Bomber: This one will not target the shield but will try to bomb your cannon. Shoot it 
   and/or it's bombs before they reach their target. 
 
4. The Scout: This one will call in replacement ships so see to it that he doesn't stay long.

The year is 2037. Nations no longer fight monster wars, killing millions. Instead, two combatants 
enter an arena and fight for their countries honor. 
 
This is a sequel to the 1977 game Combat however, there are no planes, just tanks and missiles. Each 
player starts in a base in a corner, one in the upper left, the other in the lower right. You must 
seek out your opponent and shoot them three times to destroy their tank. If they are under trees or, 
in another game variation, behind walls, you must shoot the trees/walls out of the way first to reach 
them. Each player has three tanks. The winner is the last one standing. 
 
If you are still in your base, you can press the button to fire a homing missile that will seek out 
you opponent. When the homing missile hits, it counts as two shots. Missiles must reload between 
shots and the reloading time is several seconds. If a tank is not hit for several seconds, the 'crew' 
will affect repairs. 
 
There are game variations for trees, which you can drive but not shoot through, walls, which you can 
neither drive nor shoot through   and versions where you can place the trees/walls where you would 
like them to be.

have heard of Alpha Ro's plight and have sent a vast Cosmic Ark thousands of light-years across the 
galaxy to try and save as many species as possible. As the captain of the Ark, the player will have 
to contend with deadly meteor storms and planetary defense systems to succeed the mission. 
 
Cosmic Ark features two play screens: On the first, the player will have to blast meteors with 
four-way cannons. Blast enough and the player can go on to the second screen. The Ark descends low 
over one of Alpha Ro's planets. The player will then have to guide a shuttle craft down and beam 
aboard two creatures, while avoiding any laser defense system that may be in operation. The player 
will have to get the creatures back on board quickly, because another meteor shower could happen at 
any moment. Then it's off to the next planet!

Civilization is doomed! You are our last hope! You must protect the Cosmic Kids from the Cosmic 
Creeps as they escape the orbit-decaying planet! 
 
The first part of the game is The Voyage. You begin on the bottom in your Orbinaut. You must move to 
the space station at the top while avoiding plasma, which moves from top to bottom, and Space 
Skeeters, which move left to right or right to left. If you are hit by anything, you will spin off 
into space and must begin again. Releasing a new Orbinaut, however, also causes the planet to decay a 
little more 
 
The second part of the game is The Rescue. A Cosmic Kid starts at the bottom left of the screen and 
moves to the right then goes up one level moving left, all the while being chased by one or two 
Cosmic Creeps. You, using the space station, must fire and time your shots to hit a Creep, sending 
them back to the bottom. If your shot hits the Kid, a new Kid must start at the bottom and the 
planet's orbit decays a little more. 
 
If the planet's orbit decays completely or if a Cosmic Creep gets to the upper right of the screen, 
the game is over. You get 100 points for each Creep you shoot and 1500 points for each Kid you get to 
safety. You need to score 5000 points on the Rescue screen to advance to the next level, where you 
will start the Voyage again, only faster.

You are at the Waypoint Interstellar Trade Depot, a quiet outpost in space, when suddenly a dormant 
group of alien, mineral-eating termites awakens. They then begin haphazardly making their nest. 
 
Using your probe ship, you must destroy the termites and their nest blocks. You simply fire at the 
termites to destroy them but their nest blocks must be energized before you can destroy them. To 
energize a nest block, you must hit a block while a termite is still carrying it. This will energize 
all the blocks on the screen. 
 
If you shoot a termite that is not carrying a block or if one is carrying a block but you only hit 
the termite, all the blocks will not be energized and not be damageable. If you run into a block, 
energized or not, or are touched by a termite, you lose a life. 
 
Every so often, a refuel ship travels down and then back up the left or right side of the screen. You 
must dock with it (touch it) before it gets back to the top or the game ends, no matter how many 
lives you have left. 
 
To fire, press the fire button. To move, move the joystick while the button is not pressed. If you 
hold down the button, you can rotate left or right then you will stay at that angle until you rotate 
again. 
 
The points are: 
Shooting a termite that is NOT carrying a block=1 point 
Shooting a termite that is carrying a block but only hitting the termite=2 points 
Shooting a termite that is carrying a block and hitting the block=3 points 
Shooting an energized block=1 point

As a professional ornithologist, you're thrilled to find out that some rare South American hornbills 
have nested in your "old yolk tree." But while the hornbills are out feeding, a group of mischievous 
bluebirds, owls, and snakes begin raiding their nests and stealing eggs. 
 
You get out your slingshot and begin hitting the marauding creatures. But you have to be careful. If 
you hit an egg-carrying bird, it drops the egg and you have to act fast to catch it before it hits 
the ground and return it to a nest. At the same time, you have to watch for snakes that may be 
sneaking up to nests and gobbling eggs. If you can protect the eggs long enough, you can take them to 
another nesting site.

Crazy Climber (1983) (Atari) (c) 1982 Nihon Bussan Co., Ltd. / Atari, Inc. 
 
As Crazy Climber, climb your way to the top of a series of buildings, where a helicopter is waiting 
to pick you up and take you to the next building. As Climber scales a building, he is able to climb 
up and sideways but he cannot climb down. 
While climbing a building, windows will open and close simultaneously. If any window closes on either 
of his hands he will lose his grip. However, if a window closes on both of his hands, he will fall to 
his death, resulting in the loss of a life. You have three Climbers in total, but you are awarded an 
extra Climber every 30,000 points. Besides windows, Climber is faced with other dangers, including: 
 
1. Bald-headed guys who hurl various objects at you. 
2. Pesky condors who fly by, dropping eggs and droppings of an unpleasant substance. 
3. Falling steel girders and iron dumbells. 
4. Electrical "Nichibutsu" signs with a dangling live wire. 
5. Falling "Crazy Climber" signs. 
6. King Kong leaping from side to side of the building and slams his hands against the windows. 
 
The climber must try to avoid or overcome each of those hazards which he will encounter as he 
continues climbing in his attempt to reach the rooftop. If he falls to his death by windows or 
objects,  another climber will replace him and will start at the same location where the last one 
fell. The specific danger will not be present at the same point, so the climber can go further up to 
face the next danger. Most of the hazards are announced by certain recognizable musical themes. 
 
Crazy Climber is awarded a bonus score on each building every time after getting carried off by the 
helicopter. However, each bonus score will decrease by every ten seconds that the climber will spend 
scaling each building as he attempts reach the top. Somewhere in the game, there is "The Lucky 
Balloon", which can lift Climber about ten stories and raise the player's bonus score if he catches 
it.

weapon, the Spectron! You will be deployed with this weapon and must destroy as many Morplus as you 
can. 
 
You have two lasers, one at the top that fires down and one at the bottom that fires up. You control 
both lasers. Depending on what you select, you can have both lasers stay parallel to each other or 
move opposite of each other. Your goal is to fire the laser, which fires from one laser to the other, 
and destroy any enemies caught in your crossfire. The mothership that drops the enemies is 
indestructible. 
 
Be aware, however, that if you fire you weapon non-stop, it will overheat and then will not fire 
until it cools a little. Also be aware of the amount of fuel you have because if you run out of fuel, 
you lose one life. You need to shoot any red fuel pods when they appear on screen.

To be born with wings... 
 
Become a F-14 Naval Aviator undergoing seek and destroy missions while dodging and gunning enemy 
bogeys in deadly dogfights with your 20mm cannon and air-to-air missiles. 
 
You cockpit comes with state of the art technology, courtesy of the U.S. Air Force: Display and main 
computer, Bogey Alert Indicator, G-Force Indicator, Electronic Counter Measures, and a Cannon 
Overheat Indicator (yes, it can overheat!)...and if your feeling up to it, give the ol'bird a boost 
to Mach 1.0! 
 
The gameplay like other simulation games consists of taking off, flying, combat and landing. Though 
most of the gameplay focuses around dogfighting with enemy bogeys (dodging missiles). In addition to 
that, there are also night-flying missions that add difficulty due to limited vision. 
 
Taking off and landing however, also required additional skill as your doing it on the USS Enterprise 
(No relation to Star Trek), not on your standard airstrip. Pay attention to the F.D. officer as your 
preparing to take off (since he's the boss when it comes to this stuff...and try no to run over 
him...yet). 
 
Your weaponry consists of a M 61 Machine Gun and 3 different AIM Missiles (AIM 7, 9, 54) each packed 
with 15 missiles (that's a lot of missiles!). 
 
After each mission you will receive a Mission Rating which is based on your flying skill, number of 
bogey kill and number of weapons fired.

You are Deadly Duck and the object is to shoot your bill bullets at crabs, the bricks they drop and 
dragonflies. 
 
Each level starts with eight crabs. The crabs grab bricks from the sides and try to drop them on you. 
You can shoot the bricks as they fall and the crabs but if a brick lands on you, you're a dead duck. 
When a brick lands, it will stay on the pond for a moment, blocking you from moving horizontally. 
 
On levels two to four, you have two, four and six dragonflies, respectively, moving together just 
under the crabs. You get ten points for shooting the dragonflies but this makes them angry. They then 
drop one, two or three bombs (depending on the level). If you are next to a bomb when it explodes, 
your goose is cooked. 
 
The game continues until you lose all you ducks. 
 
It's all enough to make you quack up.

In this game, you are the destroyer and must drop depth charges onto passing submarines. You time 
your drops so as they sink, they will hit the sub. 
 
You score more points for hitting deeper subs. On the bottom of the screen is your viewport. Think of 
this as your radar. You can see the subs approaching before they come into the game area. At the top 
of the screen are two scores. The top score is your actual score. The bottom score is the bonus score 
you will collect if you hit the bonus sub, when it appears. You cannot collect your bonus unless and 
until you manage to hit the bonus sub, which is a different color and makes a different sound than 
the other subs. 
 
At the bottom of the screen, below the viewport, are two numbers. The left number is how many subs 
can escape you before the game is over. This number starts at ten and counts down for each sub that 
escapes. When this number reaches zero, the game is over. The bonus sub doesn't increase this escape 
count. The number on the right is the sub speed. This number starts at zero and increases up to nine, 
depending on your score or bonus score. 
 
The amount of bonus you get per sub varies depending on how many subs you have hit before hitting the 
bonus sub. Once you hit the bonus sub, the bonus per sub amount resets to the lowest amount and 
begins climbing again.

Demon Attack (1982) (Imagic) (c) 1982 Imagic / Imagic 
 
Demon Attack is an arcade action game with gameplay similar to Space Invaders. You control a laser 
canon at the bottom of the screen, and need to destroy wave after wave of brightly colored demons. 
The demons bounce around the screen in bizarre patterns, and try to destroy your canon with bombs or 
lasers. When you shoot a demon, it will be replaced with another or will split into two smaller 
demons depending on which wave you are playing. When the required number of demons for the current 
round is finally destroyed, you can move on to the next, more difficult round.

Demons to Diamonds (1982) (Atari) (c) 1982 Atari, Inc. / Atari, Inc. 
 
In Demons to Diamonds, you control a laser zapper which moves horizontally at either the top or the 
bottom of the screen. Your goal is to earn as many points as possible by shooting objects in the 
center of the screen. Wandering back and forth in the middle are demons which can be one of two 
colors. If you shoot a demon that is the same color as your zapper, it will turn into a diamond. 
Shooting the diamond before it disappears will earn you bonus points. If you shoot a demon of the 
opposite color, it will instead turn into a skull which will rapidly fire at your zapper. You begin 
the game with five zappers, and the game ends when all five have been destroyed by skulls. The game 
can be played by one or two players, and several game variations are included to set the level of 
difficulty.

Desert Falcon is an arcade style shooter. Many of the Pharaoh's great treasures are lost throughout 
the desert, and your goal is to steal as many as you can to earn points. The game features a 
scrolling, isometric point of view as you control your falcon through the various desert landscapes. 
The treasures you are after are guarded of course. Many desert creatures including vultures, 
warriors, flying fish, sphinxes and more will all attempt to stop you from succeeding in your task. 
Also, at the end of each level you will need to face a large, howling sphinx before you can continue 
on. Your falcon isn't completely unarmed, and has the ability to fire darts which can be used to 
destroy the assorted enemies and the sphinx. In the sand, you will occasionally come across some 
hieroglyphs. Several different superpowers can be gained by landing and hopping over three of these 
hieroglyphs. Depending on which hieroglyphs are collected, you may become invincible, warp to the end 
of the level, earn free points, trick enemies into attacking a decoy instead of you, or even get an 
air bomb which destroys all airborne enemies.

Dig Dug is a 1-2 player arcade game in which you have to use your shovel to dig your way through the 
earth. Stopping you from doing this are two monsters, called Pooka and Fygar, who will continually 
chase you around. The only weapon that you carry is an air pump, which you can use to inflate the 
monsters to the point where they explode. (if you start to inflate them but stop doing so, the 
monsters will get turned back to their normal selves.) Furthermore, rocks are scattered throughout 
the earth, and you can use these rocks to squash them. If the monsters do not find you for several 
seconds, they will eventually get turned into ghosts, which are able to walk through the earth. They 
are invincible and cannot be killed. From time to time, vegetables will appear in the center, and you 
can get these for points.

Donkey Kong (1982) (Coleco) (c) 1982 Nintendo Co., Ltd. / Coleco 
 
Released in the arcades in 1981, Donkey Kong was not only Nintendo's first real smash hit for the 
company, but marked the introduction for two of their most popular mascots: Mario (originally 
"Jumpman") and Donkey Kong. 
 
Donkey Kong is a platform-action game that has Mario scale four different industrial themed levels 
(construction zone, cement factory, an elevator-themed level, and removing rivets from girders) in an 
attempt to save the damsel in distress, Pauline, from the big ape before the timer runs out.  Once 
the rivets are removed from the final level, Donkey Kong falls, and the two lovers are reunited.  
From there, the levels start over at a higher difficulty. 
 
Along the way, Mario must dodge a constant stream of barrels, "living" fireballs, and spring-weights. 
 Although not as powerful as in other future games, Mario can find a hammer which allows him to 
destroy the barrels and fireballs for a limited amount of time.  Additionally, Mario can also find 
Pauline's hat, purse and umbrella for additional bonus points. 
 
Donkey Kong is also notable for being one of the first complete narratives in video game form, told 
through simplistic cut scenes that advance the story.  It should also be noted that in versions of 
the game for early 1980's consoles, Donkey Kong only used 2-3 of the original levels, with the cement 
factory usually omitted.

Donkey Kong Junior (1983) (Coleco) (c) 1983 Nintendo Co., Ltd. / Coleco 
 
Mario has kidnapped Junior's Papa! 
 
Donkey Kong Jr. was originally released in the arcades in 1982 as a sequel to Donkey Kong.  In this 
game, Mario plays the antagonist, finally having captured Donkey Kong, and has put the ape in a 
locked cage.  As Donkey Kong Jr., players will have to make their way through four different levels 
(Vines, Springboard, Chains and Mario's Hideout) in an attempt to find keys to free the little 
monkey's Father. 
 
Along the way, Mario will send out Snapjaws, swooping purple birds, and electric sparks in an attempt 
to stop Junior.  Junior can defend himself by dropping fruit found around the levels on the heads of 
his foes.  The more foes a piece of fruit hits in a falling sequence, the higher bonus points can be 
scored. 
 
Junior can also avoid enemies more easily by grabbing hold of two chains or vines at a time to climb 
away faster, or by jumping over his foes.  However, any long fall or falling into the water on 
certain levels will mean the loss of a life for Junior. 
 
In the final cut scene, Junior will free Donkey Kong and both will escape after giving Mario the 
boot.  Once all four levels are cleared, the game levels will start over at a higher difficulty. 
 
Like the original Donkey Kong, the earlier 1980's console versions do not have all of the levels and 
animations from the arcade.

Set in a post-apocalyptic New York, Double Dragon is the story of Billy and Jimmy Lee, twin brothers 
trained in the fighting style of Sou-Setsu-Ken. Together, they manage a small martial arts training 
school, teaching their students in self-defense. One day, Billy's girlfriend, Marian, is kidnapped 
off the street by the "Black Warriors", a savage street gang led by a man named Willy. The Black 
Warriors demand the Lee brothers disclose their martial arts secrets in exchange for Marian's 
freedom. The Lee brothers set out on a rescue mission to crush the Black Warriors and save Marian. 
 
Using whatever techniques they have at their disposal, from the basic punches and kicks to the 
invulnerable elbow strike, as well any weapon that comes into their hands, the Lee brothers must 
pursue the gang through the city slum, industrial area and the forest before reaching their hideout 
to confront the big boss, Willy.

time, the amulet imbued the dragon with cunning and power so that it began to spread treachery and

defeat the dragon once and for all. Taking up the call to arms, the player begins by gathering their 
strength and fighting creatures in the enchanted countryside to build up enough power to become a 
Dragonstomper. When finally ready, the player moves on to an oppressed village near the dragon's lair 
in order to recruit soldiers, buy magical scrolls, and acquire medicines and elixirs needed to face 
the dragon in its lair. With all of his skills, training, equipment and soldiers, the Dragonstomper

Elevator Action (1983) (Atari) (c) Aug 11, 2001 Taito Corporation / CGE Services Corporation 
 
You are Agent 17 (codename: "Otto"). Your mission is to secure all top secret documents from a 
security building and escape in the getaway car, located in the basement of the building. 
 
Enemies spies are scattered throughout the 30-floor building and they have only one mission: execute 
Agent 17 at all costs. There are several ways in which Agent 17 can kill them: 
 
1. Shooting them with his gun. 
2. Kicking them by jumping onto them. 
3. Shooting a light on the ceiling while in an elevator, dropping the light onto one of them. 
4. Crushing them with an elevator. 
 
Whenever a light has been dropped, the hallways will be dark for a short period of time, making the 
enemy spies harder to see. The same holds true for hallways that are already dark. 
 
While Otto is in an elevator, he will have complete control of it by moving up or down. Agent 17 can 
still get killed if he's already in an elevator if a bullet's trajectory is aimed at it.. When Otto 
is not in an elevator, it will move from floor to floor automatically, even when enemy spies are in 
it. Otto is able to leap over the elevator gaps, but he must be as close to the edge as possible 
without falling off in order to make the jump safely. If there is an elevator cable in the way, 
however, it will block him, causing him to fall. 
 
Just because the game is called Elevator Action doesn't mean that elevators are the only means of 
travel. There are also escalators which you can ride up or down, useful if you want to avoid gunfire 
and don't have time to jump. 
 
Otto must go into the rooms with red doors to collect the top secret documents. If he tries to get to 
his car without getting all the documents, he cannot escape and must go back and collect the 
remaining documents. Once he has all the documents and drives away, he then proceeds to the next 
building. 
 
If Otto takes too much time to collect the documents, the alarm will go off, and he will have trouble 
controlling the elevators, which will take time to react. Bad guys will be especially aggressive. The 
alarm doesn't go off when Otto loses a life, it only resets after finishing a building. Besides 
ducking, bad guys may also drop themselves and lay flat on the floor. It's virtually impossible for 
Otto to shoot bad guys when they do this. Also, Otto cannot duck when in an elevator.

parent to advance to the next problem, start the game and count apples. In one player, you advance 
automatically. 
 
The left difficulty switch is used to select one or two player. The right difficulty switch is used 
to select addition or subtraction. These must be selected at the main menu before you begin your 
game. The game select switch returns you to the main menu if you are in a game or changes the game 
number on the main menu. The TV Type switch switches in and out of the counting screen in a game or 
set the speed of the pacer (timer) on the main menu. 
 
There are three types of games, each with up to ten difficulty levels. In game type one, called 
Practice, there is no time limit. The child can take as long as needed to answer the problem. In game 
type two, called Pacer, there will be a plus or minus sign at the bottom that moves from left to 
right. If it reaches the right side barrier, the problem is marked as wrong then it is on to the next 
problem. You can set the pacer speed from the main menu with the TY Type switch. If your difficulty 
level allows for counting, when you switch to the counting apples screen, the timer stops and when 
you return, it resets. In game type three, called Phantom, in addition to having a time limit, the 
only answer selection that shows is the one that the arrow is under.

Ow! Your head hurts. Where are you? What happened? It is dark but you here a beeping and find a PDA 
at your feet. You note there is a dot on the PDA screen. When you take a step, it move, too.  
Interesting. There is a button and stick. When you press the button, you see the walls of part of a 
maze. Moving the stick lets you look at more maze. All very well but you note that there is a timer 
counting down. You have a suspicion that when it ends, so will you. 
 
You begin in a maze on the lower left corner. You can move anywhere but cannot pass through walls or 
the outer perimeter. If you press fire, you can see a spotlighted area of the maze and by holding 
down the button, you can move the joystick around to see more maze. You must find the exit before the 
timer, which begins counting down as soon as you move, reaches zero. In the maze, there is a box that 
will give you more time. If the timer reaches zero, game is over. Once you exit the maze, you get any 
remaining time as your score. If you never used the spotlight in that maze, your score is doubled.

Using an anti-matter launcher, you must defend the starbase L5 against a non-stop horde of blue 
Megalyte warrior ships and their death ships. As the warriors reach the bottom, they fire on your 
base. It does not hurt the base but would lose you one of your four lives. Sometimes the death ship 
takes a dive towards your base, firing as it goes. If it reaches your base, it will destroy your 
generator, losing you a life. 
 
As hordes of Megalye ships descend, you can hold down the fire button. This will keep the anti-matter 
launcher in place and moving the paddle will shift the cursor and thus your aim. If you are in danger 
of being shot or need to destroy a death ship, just release the button and then you can move the 
launcher left or right. 
 
There are 26 game variations. The odd numbered ones are one player, the even numbered are two player. 
 
Scoring 
You score ten points for each death ship you destroy 
Your points vary for the warrior ships. The farther from you they are, the more the points.

Entombed (1982) (US Games) (c) 1982 Western Technologies Inc. / U.S. Games 
 
What started out as a nice little archaeological expedition has suddenly become a nightmarish fight 
for survival! A team of archaeologists is trapped in an underground maze of dark, winding tunnels. 
All around them, fearsome zombies are emerging from the crypts. The archaeologists' only hope of 
survival (apart from some very fast running) is an ancient device known as the 'make-break', which 
can be used to either create or destroy pieces of wall. 
 
In this increasingly frantic one or two-player arcade game, you'll need wits as well as dexterity. 
You'll have to think on the fly, plan strategically and race through the maze as fast as you can. 
Fail to keep up the pace and you're zombie fodder. Good luck!

Escape from the Mindmaster (1982) (Starpath) (c) 1982 Starpath Corporation / Starpath Corporation 
 
You've been abducted! Kidnapped! Shanghaied! You find yourself in a huge maze being watched by the 
Mindmaster. He is testing your intelligence, reflexes, agility, etc. The honor of you and the entire 
human race depends on how fast you can solve the Mindmaster's puzzles and six mazes. 
 
You begin in maze one. You must go through the maze and find colored, shaped pegs then find the 
correct shaped hole to put it in. As if that wasn't bad enough, there is an Alien Stalker wandering 
the maze and if he touches you, you lose one chance. You can tell how close he is by the beeping 
sound. The faster and higher it is, the closer he is. He cannot pass through walls or doors. Also, 
starting with maze two, there are force fields in the maze that if you touch them, you lose one 
chance. There are also one-way doors starting with maze four. If you go through one and turn around, 
there is no way back. You can never go through a door when backing up. 
 
There are also skill tests in mazes one through five that you can complete for points. They are as 
follows: 
Maze 1: Agility - Move your cursor from side to side to avoid the falling bricks. The four collisions 
and the test is done. 
Maze 2: Reflexes - Press your joystick in the direction of the arrow 
Maze 3: Recall - Watch the sequence of flashing arrows then move your joystick in the same sequence 
Maze 4: Dexterity - The same as the agility test except the test is over if you get hit once 
Maze 5: Coordination - Land a lander onto a platform without using much fuel. You get up to five 
attempts. 
 
You start each maze with sixty points and every few seconds a point is deducted. The total score for 
each maze is the score you got on the skill test plus whatever is left of the beginning sixty when 
you exit the maze. If you lose all your chances or finish maze six, you will get your final score and 
the Mindmaster's impression of you and the human race.

The difficulty switch on the left controls the number of chances you get.

You are a UFO. You must shoot tall and short towers above ground. You can shoot the short ones on any 
part of them but the tall ones must be shot at the firing spot. To shoot, you move in the direction 
you want to shoot, the press fire. You have to do this every time you shoot. 
 
After you destroy ten towers, a tunnel will open so you can get underground. You will have three 
chances to get underground. If you choose to remain above ground, the firing rate of the enemies 
doubles. 
 
Underground, the tunnel narrows after a time. If, after you hit ten towers underground, the firing 
speed doubles. 
 
Points: 
Hitting a tall above ground tower=50 points 
Hitting a short above ground tower=20 points 
Hitting an underground tower=50 to 360 points 
Getting through tunnel safely without hitting a tower=20 points 
 
After a certain amount of towers are hit, the ground turns from green to blue. When this happens, if 
you hit ten towers, you get an extra man. You can only have a maximum of eight extra men.

button. You will then be on the Ground Control Approach screen or GCA.  Here you must center the 
plane's nose on the glide slope and localizer before it arrives at the end of the runway. If the 
landing is successful, the plane will disappear from the ARC screen and a new one will appear soon to 
take its place. If not, when you press your joystick button and return to the ARC screen, the plane 
will still be there. If a plane starts flashing on the ARC and you hear an emergency sound, this 
plane has an emergency and must be landed first.

move on to the next round and are given one additional fireball to keep in play. Five different game 
variations are included: 
 
Firetrap: Two additional fireballs are trapped within brick walls. Once a hole forms in the walls, 
you will also need to keep these additional fireballs in play. 
 
Marching Blocks: In this game, each time you catch a fireball the rows of blocks will drop down one 
level. From time to time, a mystery fireball may also appear. 
 
Knock-A-Block: This is the most basic game variation. There is a solid wall of blocks at the top of 
the screen that you need to destroy. 
 
Migrating Blocks: In this game, the rows of blocks move! Every few seconds each row of blocks will 
rotate either to the left or to the right. 
 
Cascade: There are five additional fireballs trapped within the block formation! When you destroy 
enough blocks to release an extra fireball, it too will need to be kept in play.

shark, the shark will eat it and you then will have to catch another fish. Two difficulty levels are 
available, and the game can be played by one person against the computer or two players against each 
other.

Flash Gordon (1983) (20th Century Fox) (c) 1983 Sirius Software, Inc. / Fox Video Games, Inc. 
 
You are Flash Gordon. Many spacemen have entered Spider City but never returned. Your job, Flash, is 
two fold. Rescue any spacemen you find in the tunnels of Spider City and destroy all the hatching 
pods. 
 
The lower part of the screen is a map. You are the horizontal line, the hatching pods are the 
vertical lines and the Disrupters are the crosses. The upper part of the screen is the close-up of 
the action. 
 
You rescue spacemen by touching them with your ship. You destroy hatching pods, and the spider 
warriors that hatch, by flying to the pods then shooting the warriors. 
 
You can also shoot generators, patrol ships and debris. Shooting the generator will keep the 
Disrupter from moving about the city for a little bit but the debris never stops while you are 
within, so don't hang out in the Disrupter. 
 
If you destroy five warriors at one hatching pod or your ship is destroyed when it returns, you will 
have a shield for a short time. There will be two beeps to warn you of the shield leaving. 
 
The scoring is as follows: 
10 points = Debris 
25 points = Patrol Ship 
70 points = Rescued Spaceman 
100 points = Disrupter Generator 
 
You get 100 points for killing the first warrior at a pod, 200 for the second, 300 for the third and 
so on. 
 
You lose 1,000 points if you shoot a spaceman, but Flash Gordon would never do that, right? 
 
Every time you conquer a city, you get an extra man.

your players after a play is selected or allowing the computer to control the players. The third game 
has the computer controlling the players at all times and you only need to select the plays you wish 
it to execute  and indicate when you wish to punt or pass the ball. In all of the game variations the 
timer begins at 5 minutes, and is active only during plays. Of course, the team with the most points 
when the timer runs out wins!

Ah, you poor woodcutter. You just want to cut some wood to sell so your family can eat but an evil 
witch has put a spell on the animals so they are attacking you. Well, no matter, one way or another 
you'll get your tree! 
 
You must make your way two screens to the right to get to your tree. Animals will come at you from 
either side of the screen. You must either jump over the animal or press your button and push the 
joystick in the desired direction to chop them with your axe. Snakes cannot be chopped, only jumped 
over. 
 
Also to contend with is a bird in the air that is dropping stones. If you are hit by a stone, you 
will be unable to move for two seconds, which could prove fatal. Once you reach the tree, you must 
chop it down while still avoiding the animals. It takes four chops per side to fell the tree. If you 
need to, you can climb the tree to avoid animals. Once the tree is chopped, the game restarts at a 
faster level. You have only one life so if an animal touches you, it is game over.

Frankenstein's Monster (1983) (Data Age) (c) 1983 Data Age, Inc. / Data Age, Inc. 
 
In the cold dark night you make your way through the ghoulish castle of Dr. Frankenstein. There you 
must prevent him from completing his creation. 
 
Your only chance is to gather stones from the dungeon and bring them to the tower where you must 
build a barricade around the monster before he has accumulated enough energy to come alive. 
 
You start at the top floor of the castle and must make your way to the dungeon to get a stone to wall 
in the monster, all the while avoiding ghosts, giant tarantulas, trapdoors, spiders and a pool of 
acid. Once you have the stone, you must make your way back to the top, again avoiding these 
obstacles. When you get near the monster, you switch to a new screen where you must make your way 
past bats to place the stone. You must do this four times and each time gets harder, with more 
ghosts, more and bigger tarantulas, and a harder to cross acid pool. 
 
You have three lives and falling into the acid pool will lose you one. You are also timed (see 
Difficulty settings) and you are trying to get and not lose points. 
 
Game variations 
The only variation is one or two players 
 
Difficulty switches 
Left for player one, right for player two 
Set to A for a five minute timer. Set to B for an eight-and-a-half minute timer. 
 
Scoring 
You start with five hundred points. 
If you touch a ghost, tarantula or spider, you lose 20 points 
If you touch a bat, you lose 10 points 
If you fall through a trapdoor, you lose 100 points 
If you fall in the pool of acid, you lose 200 points as well as one life 
Each stone you place gets you 500 points 
If you place all four stones, you get a 100 point bonus for each unit of time saved.

Your task in this arcade conversion is to guide a frog across a treacherous road and river, and to 
safety at the top of the screen. Both these sections are fraught with a variety of hazards, each of 
which will kill the frog and cost you a life if contact is made. 
 
The road is full of cars and trucks, at variable speeds. The river water itself is fatal, as are the 
snakes which hover within on later levels. Frogger must use the arrangement of logs, turtles (which 
are only there for a short time) and alligators (but stay away form their faces), and then jump into 
one of the open home-cells, ideally one containing a fly for extra points. Once all holes have been 
filled, you move onto the next, harder, level.

Shifty 
2. Scar Face 
3. Mugsy 
4. Lefty 
5. Nitro Ed 
 
Your orders are to snipe any gang member. DO NOT SHOOT AN INNOCENT! Watch out for Nitro Ed. He likes 
to play with hand grenades. One of those and you're pushing up daisies. Good luck. 
 
You move the joystick to aim at a gangster and push the button to fire. Your ammo is limited so don't 
fire randomly. Occasionally, Nitro Ed, on the roof, will hold up a grenade. You must shoot him to 
disarm him. You get money for each gangster shot. The values for level one are: 
 
1. Mugsy=$20 
2. Scare Face=$30 
3. Lefty=$40 
4. Shifty=$50 
5. Disarming Nitro Ed=$100 
 
These amounts increase for each level by $10.  You also get $10 for each bullet you have left after 
each level. There are six levels. The fourth level is a nighttime level. In this level, you must fire 
one bullet to light up the windows. If you do not fire for a couple seconds, they go dark again. 
If you shoot an innocent, you will lose $1000 or you total amount if you have less than $1000. 
 
If a gangster rises all the way out of a window, after a couple of seconds, he will shoot you and you 
will lose one bullet proof vest (life). After you lose all your vests, the game is over and Nitro Ed 
will laugh at you. If Nitro Ed gets off his hand grenade, no matter how many vests you have, the game 
is over. And Nitro Ed will laugh at you. You start with four vests and can earn another at $5000.

also see numbers along your way. Run into them to acquire their point value. Do not shoot them or 
their value will be deducted from you score.

You are the great explorer, Sir Robert Wittenbottom. You have discovered an ancient civilization deep 
within the forest of a mysterious island. Since you're a likable old fellow, they have decided to 
induct you into their council of warriors. But first you must prove your worthiness by running the 
gauntlet. 
 
You are given three glasses of water. You must run through the gauntlet to the ceremonial fires and 
use your water to put them out. You current glass of water will then be refilled then it is off to 
the next fire. 
 
Of course, it is not that easy. You must jump over rocks and logs, duck under stones, arrows and 
tomahawks, and avoid hitting trees or touching the sides of the gauntlet.You can ease the thirst of 
the old men you come across for points but it will cost you water. The game is over when you run out 
of your third glass of water. To jump, just press the fire button. To duck, pull back then press the 
fire button. 
 
Scoring: 
Jump over a rock or a log=50 points 
Duck under an arrow, stone or tomahawk=100 points 
Give an old man a drink of water=250 points

Ghostbusters (1985) (Activision) (c) 1985 Activision, Inc. / Activision, Inc. 
 
Based on the movie of the same name, the Ghostbusters are the ones to call who will "bust" any ghost 
hauntings. It does this through the use of nuclear accelerated "proton packs" and traps, whereby the 
ghosts can be captured and transferred to a secure storage facility. However New York City has 
suddenly become a very haunted place, and the number of ghosts has suddenly increased. The 
Ghostbusters must reduce the paranormal (PK) level in the city, representing ghost power, before the 
Temple of Zuul awakens and ressurects an evil goddess, Gozer. 
 
Ghostbusters is an action game that combines an overhead view and a side-view. From Ghostbusters HQ, 
the player must monitor the map of New York City for "ghost alarms" as well as casual spirits, and 
plot a route to the alarmed area. The player then controls the Ghostbuster vehicle as it drives 
through traffic. Here, the player is able to capture casual ghosts on the way if they are en route. 
Once at the location, the game switches to a side-view. Two of the ghostbusters will take position 
and activate their proton beams and toss a trap to the ground. The player will attempt to  maneuver 
the ghost(s) over the placed trap. Once activated, the trap attempts to capture any ghosts directly 
above it. Successful capture will earn the player money, which can then be used to purchase new 
Ghostbusters vehicles and new modifications for the vehicle. Unsuccessful capture will see the ghost 
fly away. 
 
As the game progresses, the PK energy of the city increases. Ghostbusters must keep it under critical 
levels by being constantly  successful at ghost captures. Eventually the Temple of Zuul will 
activate, and if the PK levels are still manageable, the Ghostbusters can venture there for a final 
showdown with Gozer.

This is a version of Scrabble for the Atari 2600. 
 
The letters on the top row are shuffled and then you use them to make words on the bottom row. If the 
bottom row shows all spaces in pink or red, then the points for the word are doubled or tripled, 
respectively. If there is a light blue or blue line under a space, then the points for that letter 
are doubled or tripled, respectively. After you create a word, move down to the E button and press 
the red joystick button one time. This stops the timer so you can confirm the word is acceptable. If 
the word is acceptable, press the button again to collect points and go to the next round. If not, 
move to the P button to pass on the word and go to the next round. In a two player game, after you 
press the E button once, the other player then must press the button again to enter the word. Play 
continues until you have 14 rounds in a one player game or 7 each in a two player game.

Golf features a nine hole, par 36 course which can be played by one or two players. The game is 
played from an overhead view of the course, which is complete with sand traps, water hazards, trees, 
and rough. The player doesn't have the ability to choose different clubs, so the distance the ball 
travels is controlled by how big of a backswing is taken. The direction is controlled by the location 
of the player in relation to the ball. When the player finally reaches the green, the view switches 
to a closeup of the green for putting. Two different skill levels are available which control the 
size of the cup and the amount of power lost in the rough or sand.

There is trouble in the mines! Volcanic activity has trapped numerous miners, and it is your job to 
save them. As Roderick Hero, you need to make your way through the dangerous mineshaft avoiding the 
dangerous creatures and lava, and find out where the miners are located before you run out of energy. 
To help on your mission, Roderick Hero has several useful types of equipment. A prop pack will allow 
you to hover and fly around the mineshaft and (hopefully) avoid the many dangers within. Your helmet 
features a short range microlaser beam which can be used to destroy the bats, spiders, snakes, and 
other creatures you'll encounter in the mines. From time to time, your path through the mine may be 
blocked by stone or lava walls. You begin each mission with six sticks of dynamite which can be used 
to destroy these obstacles (be careful you don't blow yourself up, though!) If you run out of 
dynamite, your laser beam can also be used to destroy the walls, though this will take longer and use 
up more energy. As the levels progress, the mine shaft will become longer and more maze-like, 
creatures will more frequently block the path, and lava walls and pools will appear which are 
dangerous to the touch.

Home Run (1978) (Atari) (c) 1978 Atari, Inc. / Atari, Inc. 
 
The game can be played against the computer or with another player. You have the option to have 1, 2 
or 3 players in the field. As a pitcher, you use the joystick to throw the ball and to control its 
speed and curve. After the ball is hit, your control all your men (they all move together since they 
follow the orders of a single joystick) in the field to catch the ball. As a batter, you can control 
the position of the baseball bat with the joystick. If you consider that your runners would make it 
to the next base, you can press the controller button so they stop at their current base. 
 
The rest of the rules are basically like real baseball. Each team has nine innings in a game. You are 
out after three strikes, your get to first base after four balls (balls that do not fly over Home) or 
if the pitcher hits you with a ball. In the field, you can put out a batter by catching his ball, 
then another runner by reaching his next base before him or simply by touching him between bases, 
thus completing a double play. The only way to accomplish a home run is by hitting the ball over 
second base without having it caught by the field players. You score a point for each runner that 
reaches Home base after each of the first three.

Human Cannonball (1979) (Atari) (c) 1978 Atari, Inc. / Atari, Inc. 
 
In Human Cannonball your goal is to fire a man out of a cannon and have him land in a bucket of 
water. To do this you need to adjust your cannon so the position, angle, and firing speed are just 
right. You score a point for each successful landing, and the game ends after seven attempts. Several 
game variations are included which allow you to have the position, angle and speed all set by the 
player, or have one or more of these in a fixed position, or have one or more of these randomly set 
by the computer. If you wish to make the game more challenging, you can also set a moving wall in 
front of the bucket which will make your timing more critical.

Hunchy II (2005) (Homebrew) (c) Jul 05, 2005 
 
A 4k game (three more than its predecessor!), Hunchy 2 boasts more bells and whistles (admittedly 
more bells than whistles) than the game it is nominally a successor to, the Atari 2600's Hunchy, and 
though superficially drawing thematic inspiration from Hunchback II: Quasimodo's Revenge, its basic 
gameplay has been more directly derived from Chuckie Egg and Miner 2049er. 
 
The gameplay in question involves a progression through 14 levels 
of platforming to impress Esmeralda, climbing up and down ladders to gather bells while avoiding 
guards and a regular stream of missiles being fired in from the sides.

Indy 500 (1978) (Atari) (c) 1977 Atari, Inc. / Atari, Inc. 
 
Indy 500 is a racing game played from a top down point of view. In the one player game, your goal is 
to complete as many laps as you can in 60 seconds. In the two player game, the first player to 
complete 25 laps wins! Included are several different race tracks, two difficulty levels, and 
additional game variations called ice race, tag, and crash 'n score. In ice race, the track is icy 
causing your car to slide often and making it difficulty to steer.  In tag, one player is "it" and 
needs to tag the other player. For each second you race without being tagged, a point is earned. 
Lastly, in crash 'n score the goal is to crash into targets which appear on the race track. The first 
player to crash into the target earns a point, and then a new target will appear elsewhere on the 
track.

horizontally scrolling level in the game is loosely based on a different James Bond movie. The levels 
included are Diamonds Are Forever, The Spy Who Loved Me, Moonraker, and For Your Eyes Only. Each 
level has a variety of enemies trying to destroy you, and a unique goal that must be accomplished to 
continue on (for example, you may have to land on a hidden oil rig to stop Seraffino, or find 
Stromberg's undersea laboratory and destroy it). If you can complete all the missions, you win the

Joust (1982) (Atari) (c) 1983 Williams Electronics Inc. / Atari, Inc. 
 
In Joust, players take control of a knight with a lance who rides their flying ostrich (or stork, for 
Player 2) to do battle against computer-controlled evil knights who ride atop vultures. 
 
Players must flap their steed's wings to hit the enemy from a higher jousting point to destroy the 
vulture and its rider. Once the enemy has been hit, an egg falls to one of the platforms below. The 
heroic knights must destroy the eggs before they hatch and release new and increasingly more 
difficult knights. The three strengths of enemy knights are Bounder (red knight), Hunter (white 
knight), and Shadow Lord (blue knight). These enemy knights are not the only challenge to be found in 
the game. Players must also contend with crumbling platforms, lava trolls who attempt to pull knights 
into the fire, and the dreaded "unbeatable"(?) pterodactyl. 
 
The game was novel for its time for being one of the few two-player simultaneous games in the arcade.

    you need to eat all of the dots in a maze without running into the four ghosts that are trying to

    around to follow the action. From time to time a tasty bonus will bounce around the screen which 
    can be eaten for extra points. There are tricycles, kites, drums, balloons, trains, root beers, 
    and other bonuses that appear as the levels progress. When the bonus items bounce around the 
    screen, any dots they touch will become larger and are now worth 50 points each instead of 10. 
    However, one of these larger dots will cause Jr. Pac-Man to slow down greatly when he eats them 
    making it more difficult to remain one step ahead of the ghosts which constantly pursue him! 
    Located throughout the maze are power pellets

Jungle Hunt (1982) (Atari) (c) 1983 Taito Corporation / Atari, Inc. 
 
Jungle Hunt offers four unique adventure experiences, which repeat with greater difficulty once all 
four have been survived.  If you don't survive these adventures, you will not only lose your own life 
but that of the lovely Penelope, who has been captured by cannibals! 
 
The first part challenges your Tarzan skills - can you swing on the vines without plummeting to your 
doom?  The second part pits you against a whole bunch of nasty crocodiles in a mighty river.  
Fortunately, you have a knife to fight back with.  Don't forget to go up for air!  In the third part, 
you face a battle against oncoming boulders of varying sizes and physics.  Once you've cleared all 
these treacherous hazards, you still must confront the dreaded cannibal, who is armed with a wicked 
spear.  Can you get past him and save the lovely Penelope? 
 
Gameplay involves much strategic jumping and knife play (in the river/crocodile phase).  The view is 
always a side view, much like Pitfall! and later platform games.

decide which route will be faster in getting you closer to your goal. If Harry can make it to the top 
before you catch him, you will have to retry that level. Harry has no intention of letting you catch 
him easily, and is hurling everything he can find in an attempt to slow you down. Shopping carts, 
bouncing balls, biplanes, and more will all be flying past on the screen and will either slow you 
down or send you back to the beginning if you get hit. As the levels progress, Harry will run faster 
and faster, and more objects will be tossed your way to duck and jump over.

Killer Satellites (1982) (Starpath) (c) 1983 Starpath Corporation / Starpath Corporation 
 
For decades, the weapons satellites have orbited Earth harmlessly. Now, for unknown reasons, they 
have dropped from the sky to obliterate mankind. You are a test pilot with an experimental craft that 
can stop the satellites. It is up to you to protect your home town. 
 
You fly above your town's forcefield. Satellites will drop from the sky and show on the radar area at 
the screen top. You must fly to them and shoot them before they reach the town as they have the 
ability to penetrate the town's shields. Be aware of your fuel because if you run out of fuel, you 
lose a life. Also, be aware of the laser heat indicator just below the fuel gauge. If the laser gets 
too hot, it will not fire until it cools. The town's forcefield may not be able to stop the 
satellites, however, it will stop your craft so flying into it is detrimental to your health. In 
later levels, you must contend with meteors as well as satellites. You cannot shoot the meteors but 
they cannot penetrate the town's shields. You will be destroyed and lose a life, however, if you ram 
into one.

King Kong (1982) (Tigervision) (c) 1982 Tigervision / Tigervision 
 
King Kong has taken a lady to the top of the Empire State Building. It is up to you to rescue her but 
it won't be easy. Kong is throwing bombs at you. 
 
This game is a clone of Donkey Kong, except instead of barrels, you must avoid bombs. You must make 
your way across the floors and up the ladders while jumping over bombs for points and holes in the 
floor. There is also a timer in the upper right. It starts at nine-hundred ninety and counts down ten 
points per second. If you are hit by a bomb or fall through a hole in the floor or the time reaches 
zero, you lose a life. Occasionally, Kong will release a magic bomb that gives more points when you 
jump it as well as moves you to the next floor up. Once you reach the top floor, the game starts 
again but faster.

Lady Bug (2006) (Homebrew) (c) Aug 26, 2006 Universal Co., Ltd. / Champ Games 
 
An action game in the same style as Pac-Man but very very different. Players control a ladybug who 
must venture around different mazes collecting all of the food pellet "x"'s. In addition to there 
being regular lines of wall in the maze, there are also several rotating doors that can be used to 
trap enemies and escape. In fact these rotating doors are the key to survival in this game.  In the 
center of each maze is a different enemy insect hive that will spawn out enemy creatures. An new 
enemy creature is spawned every time the border around the screen makes a complete "lap". Timers for 
the border vary upon the level, so later levels will generate new enemies faster, thus progression 
through the game brings smarter, faster and more quickly spawning enemies. 
 
In addition to the collection of X's, each maze also contains a variety of powerups that come in 
three types: Poison, Letters and Hearts. Poison is deadly both to the player and the enemy. If the 
player is able to lure and enemy creature into a poison powerup, it will die and be removed from 
gameplay. Letters and hearts are powerups with multiple conditions: Collected at the right time they 
will add letters that will eventually spell words providing bonuses. However collected during the the 
improper time will only earn the player a few points. For most of the gameplay the colour of all 
powerups (except skulls which are unaffected) will be blue. But every few seconds it will cycle 
through yellow and then red colours. Grabbing a letter when flashing the colour will add it to that 
colour's word. The red word is "SPECIAL" and the yellow word is "EXTRA". Spelling the word, EXTRA 
gains the player an extra life, and spelling the word, SPECIAL brings the player to a special bonus 
round. 
 
Hearts are best used as blue powerups as they will act as multipliers for the X's being picked up, 
first as 2x, then as 3x and finally as 5x. Multipliers are lost when the player dies, but letter 
powerups are not.

London Blitz (1983) (Avalon Hill) (c) 1983 Avalon Hill / Avalon Hill 
 
During WWII German bombers turned daily existence in London into a nightmare. Most bombs exploded on 
impact but some would sit for hours, days or weeks before detonating. It was up to the Royal 
Engineers to find and defuse these unexploded bombs (UXB's) before they exploded. As a Lance Corporal 
in the Royal Engineers, it is your job to defuse these bombs. 
 
First, you will check your London map to see where the bombs are. Then it is defusing time. 
 
On the C64, you must use the joystick to cause the dial to rotate, changing the numbers next to a 
switch then clicking on the disarm switch at the bottom. If the number is wrong, you must change it 
again and keep trying. 
 
On the Atari 2600, you slide a sliding bar. On green bombs, the top bar controls the left switch, the 
middle the middle and the bottom the right.You set the slide to a spot the move to the switches and 
push right. On orange bombs, what slide bar controls what switch varies from bomb to bomb and on blue 
bombs, you can't control the switches. They just randomly change and you push right and hope you 
disarm in time. 
 
The possible ranks are: 
Lance Corporal 
Corporal 
Sargent 
Staff Sargent 
Warrant Officer 
Second Lieutenant 
First Lieutenant 
Captain 
 
At the start of the game, you can select which rank to start at, from Lance Corporal to Second 
Lieutenant on the C64 or from Lance Corporal to First Lieutenant on the Atari 2600. 
 
Every time you disarm a bomb, you move up levels within your rank. Move up eight levels and you are 
promoted. If a bomb explodes in the city and causes damage, you are demoted a level in rank. 
 
You lose the game is you are demoted below Lance Corporal or a bomb explodes while you are near it, a 
not-very-healthy thing to happen. 
 
You win if you get promoted to Captain, whereupon you will be given a desk job.

There are three airlock doors per starbase. You must get the correct key for each door. Each is held 
by one of three Malagai. The order of which Malagai is holding which key is shown by the pictures 
above the starbase. 
 
If you are away from your assigned compartment for too long, as indicated by the line at the bottom 
of the screen, the Malagai will attack and you will need to return to your compartment to make them 
friendly again. When you touch a Malagai and, if it is the correct one, get the airlock door key, the 
Malagai will attack and the airlock will flash, on most game variations (see below). You must then 
make your way to the airlock. One door will disappear and the Malagai will become friendly again. 
After you open the third door, it is off to the next starbase. 
 
After the third (blue) starbase, you get an extra man. 
 
Game Variations: 
Version 1: All the Malagai have different shapes and colors 
Version 2: All the Malagai have the same shape but different colors 
Version 3: All Malagai are the same shape and color and the airlocks do not blink to show you got the

Scoring: 
Touch a Malagai while they're friendly=100 points (50 point bonus if it has the correct key)

Mama brings pasta to the table. You must either eat the pasta, toss it to Frankie the cat when he is 
at the window, or toss it to Sergio the dog when he is under the table. 
 
You have four lives. If you eat more than 20 plates of pasta, you will burst (literally) and lose 1 
life. If more than 9 plates of pasta are placed on the table, it will collapse and you will lose 1 
life. 
 
To eat pasta, you move the joystick to the right then the left. To toss pasta to a pet, you move the 
joystick to the right then up or down in one smooth motion. You must throw when Mama's back is turned 
and the cat is in the window or the dog is in the right spot under the table. If you throw food at 
the floor or window when the pet is not in position or if Mama sees you throw food to a pet, she will 
bring 3 plates the next time. Remember, over nine plates on the table and it is arrivederci una vita 
(goodbye one life). 
 
To clear a level, you must eat or toss a certain number of plates of pasta. 
1=31 
2=32 
3=35 
4=37 
5=40 
6=42 
7=45 
8=47 
9=49 
 
The point value of each plate of pasta starts at 5 at level 1 and increases by 1 point per level, to 
a maximum of 13 at level 9. 
You get an extra life at every 1,000 points. The highest points you can reach is 9,999.

Marble Craze (2002) (Homebrew) (c) Aug 10, 2002 XYPE / Hozer Video Games 
 
This game is based on the wooden marble labyrinth puzzles. You start at the beginning of the maze and 
must use your paddle controllers to make the marble roll horizontally and vertically to the maze's 
end in the time limit. Early mazes have walls but later ones do not, meaning your marble can roll off 
the maze completely.

You are a battleship firing shells at attacking battleships and/or attacking bomber planes. 
 
The game has four scenes: fighting ships at day, fighting ships by night, fighting planes and ships 
by day, fighting planes and ships by night. You move left or right and press the button to fire. In 
the night scenes, you cannot see the ships or planes in the distance unless something explodes. 
 
It takes three hits to sink your ship. You start the game with three battleships and can get a new 
ship every 5000 points. The enemy starts out with 9 battleships and 30 aircraft. These numbers will 
increase as the scenes change according to the following formula: 
 
Number of battleships: 9 + (N - 1) x 2 
Number of aircraft: 30 + (N - 1) x 2 
where N is the pattern number. 
 
Game variations 
The only selections are one or two player. The difficulty switches are not used. 
 
Scoring 
Top row of battleships: 80 points 
Middle row of battleships: 70 points 
Bottom row of battleships: 60 points 
Enemy fighter: 80 points 
Enemy torpedo: 30 points 
Enemy bomb: 30 points

Mario and Luigi, the best plumbers in the world, have a real job on their hands. A host of characters 
have taken over the sewers, and the brothers must clear them out of the pipes. 
 
The platform puzzle which first introduced Luigi to the world has both single and multiplayer action 
with two differing game types, but with the same objective. 
Crabs, turtles and fighter flies must be cleared out by jumping underneath the platform they sit on, 
then kicking them away. Each level is cleared when a set number of coins is collected. 
 
For the two player mode, the first to collect the set amount of coins wins.

M.A.S.H. (1982) (20th Century Fox) (c) 1983 Fox Video Games, Inc. / Fox Video Games, Inc. 
 
M*A*S*H was one of the many attempts by various software companies to take a successful movie or 
  television show and convert it into a playable game. 
 
In this game, you play the role of "Hawkeye Pierce," a surgeon stationed at the Mobile Army Surgical 
Hospital #4077 during the Korean War (1950-1953). There are two main stages in the game, each of 
which you must pass to move to the next round.  The first mission involves rescuing injured soldiers 
from the battlefield with your helicopter and returning them to home base without being shot down by 
enemy tanks.  The second mission takes place in the operating room while you are required to 
carefully remove bullets and shrapnel from wounded soldiers... it is very similar to the classic 
"OPERATION" tweezers game by Milton Bradley. 
 
Each set of missions are repeated four times.  The first player to reach 999 points wins the game. 
There are four different variations of games, each selectable as either one player (against the 
computer) or two-player mode.

WANTED: A master builder to create structures per blueprints for Spectraville. To apply, insert 
cartridge into Atari 2600 and power on machine. 
 
You are shown what you are to build for 5 seconds. To get the bricks, go to either side of the screen 
and press in that direction. To lay a brick, press fire then down. When Spectradog comes on the 
screen, you must jump over him by pushing the joystick to the upper right or upper left or he will 
make you lose one life. As the building gets higher, the kid will steal the ladder. When the brat 
appears on the screen, you must get off the ladder or you will fall and lose one life. When the 
building gets to be several stories high, you must be leery of staying on the very top as lightning 
may strike and lose you a life. When you lose a life, you drop any bricks you were carrying. 
 
Once the building is complete, you go all the way up the ladder and push up to call the helicopter to 
take you to the next site. If the building is not correct, the helicopter will pick you up but then 
drop you near the edge of the screen, losing you a life. There are game selections for unlimited time

In Masters of the Universe, you control He-Man as he battles Skeletor in two different types of 
arcade action scenes. In the first part of the game, you control the Wind Raider flying towards 
Castle Grayskull. You have a limited amount of fuel with which to reach your destination, plus 
numerous fireballs will be flying around the screen trying to stop you and Skeletor will be running 
along the ground. The Wind Raider is equipped with bombs and guns which can be used to defend 
yourself from the fireballs, and also can earn bonus points if you can hit Skeletor. The second part 
of the game takes place on foot. When you've landed near the castle, He-Man needs to pursue Skeletor. 
Skeletor will be firing numerous lightning bolts which can be blocked with a shield. There is a time 
limit here, and you must get past all of the screens and catch Skeletor before time runs out. If you 
are successful, the game will repeat at a tougher skill level.

invisible, or have just a few parts invisible. With invisible mazes you can optionally have the 
computer provide a sneak peak at the complete maze periodically. To make your task more challenging, 
one to five robbers may also be placed in the maze. If you are caught by one of the robbers, you will 
momentarily be stunned giving your opponent an advantage. You can also give your cop the ability to 
set up a blockade to confuse your opponent. This will look like a regular wall, however you can walk 
straight through it. The games speed can also be adjusted, from calculatingly slow to extremely fast.

You are a member of MegaForce and have been sent to the city of Sardoun. Sardoun is under attack and 
you must defend it. You are armed with the Moto-Fighter, a sort of armed motorcycle with flight 
ability. 
 
When you are on the ground, your missiles fire down and forward, at an angle. When you are in the 
air, your missiles fire straight ahead. 
 
The object is to destroy enemy fighters, destroy or avoid ground-launched rockets, destroy fuel 
depots and destroy the enemy headquarters. Any enemy fighters that get past you will head to Sardoun 
and bomb a building. You will see a red flash at the top of the screen with the words "Defend" when 
Sardoun is in trouble. 
 
Every second you are playing, you use one gallon on fuel. If you run out of fuel, you lose a life. 
You can shoot fuel tanks to replenish. If you destroy all the tanks of that depot, a prize will 
appear that you can shoot (but may not want to). See "Prizes" for details. Each tank destroyed is 
worth eighty points and ten gallons of fuel. 
 
Each enemy fighter destroyed is worth 100 points. 
Each ground rocket destroyed is worth 300 points. 
Each tower of the enemy headquarters destroyed is worth 300 to 600 points. If you get them all, you 
get one more point. 
Each tower of Sardoun destroyed is worth 100 to 400 points and ten gallons of fuel each BUT if all 
the towers are destroyed, you will not be able to get any more points that round and will lose a life 
at the end of that round.

You are a treasure hunter exploring a maze. But wait! The walls have shifted. You might be trapped 
until they shift again. This would not be a problem except there is a wolf roaming the maze, trying 
to eat you! 
 
There are twenty mazes (levels) to this game. In each maze, you must collect ten treasures. Every few 
seconds, the walls shift, possibly trapping you until the walls shift again. The wolf, however, is 
not affected by the shifting walls. You do have a weapon, other than your wits. In each maze, you 
receive three decoys that you can place where ever you like. The wolf will always attack the decoys 
before resuming his hunt of you. 
 
Can you collect the treasure or will the wolf huff and puff and snuff out your candle?

In the Commodore 64 version, this will win you the game. In the Atari 2600 version, this will damage 
your opponent. If your opponent loses all energy, you win. You can move any stone, no matter what 
it's color. This means you could damage yourself or lose yourself the game. Once a stone has been 
moved, that move cannot be reversed.

all of the floor sections, you will need to figure out how to get there! You can jump (be careful not 
to fall too far though, or you will be squished), climb up and down ladders, and use different 
transportation devices that can be found on the levels (such as an elevator, slides, a springboard,

Bounty Bob has tracked Yukon Yohan into Nuclear Ned's uranium mine. Bob must 'claim' each section of 
each part of the mine...but cannot take too long in each area, or the radiation will kill him. 
 
Taking the role of Bob, players must traverse through different types of areas inside the nuclear 
mine. In the first level, "Lift", Bob must walk on each part of the screen to 'claim' it. Avoid the 
monsters by jumping over them or grab an old miner possession to become energized and grab a mutant 
for points. Use the lift to reach the higher parts of the screen. 
 
The next area is the Crusher, with the same goal as Lift but more challenging as the player must also 
avoid getting crushed. The last part is the Radioactive Waste, where the goal is again the same, but 
the player must maneuver Bob around the radioactive waste. In each screen, there is a timer in the 
upper right. If this timer reached zero before you claim all sections, you lose a life. 
 
After you have beaten all three screens, they repeat but without any of the bonuses for energizing, 
so you must jump over or avoid all mutants.

Mines of Minos (1982) (CommaVid) (c) 1982 CommaVid, Inc. / CommaVid, Inc. 
 
You are the last mining robot on the Minos mine. Monsters have destroyed all your comrades. 
 
As the last robot, you must traverse the mine's various levels, gathering spare parts to make more 
robots (extra lives). You must either avoid the monsters or blow them up with a bomb. After a few 
seconds, if the monster hasn't hit the bomb, it will explode harmlessly. You can only drop one bomb 
at a time. If a monster is killed, it will regenerate somewhere in the maze. 
 
To deposit your spare parts, you must get to the center top or bottom of any level. To move to 
another level, hold your joystick button down while moving through the tunnels on either side. You 
can also use these tunnels, without holding down the button, to quickly get from left or right side 
of the maze to avoid monsters. 
 
To win the game, get to level five and ram each of the three stationary monsters to kill them. You 
will need at least two spare robots as the ramming will destroy you and the monster. 
 
In two player games, player one is the robot, player two is a monster. If the robot runs into the 
monster being controlled, the monster is destroyed instead of the robot. However, by pushing the 
joystick button, player two can switch to another monster, allowing the robot to run into an 
uncontrolled (and therefore deadly) monster. 
 
Difficulty switches 
Left switch for the robot, right for the monsters. 
Set to A to make half speed, B for normal speed.

Miniature Golf (1979) (Atari) (c) 1979 Atari, Inc. / Atari, Inc. 
 
This is a computer game simulation of a Miniature Golf course. It attempts to refine your sense of 
timing and your perceptiveness in judging distance.  As in a traditional miniature golf course, a 
variety of obstacles are placed in your path to the "cup."  Depending on the game that is selected, 
the course can be played solo, or a two player competition can be initiated. 
 
Rather than a full 18 holes, this Miniature Golf variation has a nine-hole half-course.  Your goal is 
clear: taking the various obstacles into account, hit the ball through the course and complete each 
hole by knocking the ball into the cup.  The number of attempts you make for a single hole is tallied 
as strokes.  While total strokes are unlimited, each hole still has a specific par assigned to it.  
So ideally, you should make it your goal to not exceed the par assigned to each hole. 
 
Using the standard joystick controller, you can position the club to adjust the strength and angle of 
how the ball is hit. Remember that no matter how many strokes have accrued, it is necessary to get 
the ball in the cup before the game continues on to the next hole.

Missile Command (1981) (Atari) (c) 1981 Atari, Inc. / Atari, Inc. 
 
Aliens from the planet of Krytol are attacking your cities!! As the commander of a missile base, it 
is your responsibility to defend them. A variety of enemy weapons and planes will be incoming trying 
to destroy the six cities at the bottom of the screen. You need to fire missiles to destroy the 
incoming weapons. If anything gets through, one of your cities could be destroyed. When all of the 
cities are gone, the game is over. On each level you have a limited amount of ammo, so make sure most 
(if not all) of your shots are accurate or you could run out of ammo and leave your cities at risk! 
As the levels progress, there are more and more enemy weapons to destroy which come in at an 
increasingly faster rate.

Missile Control (1983) (Ariola) (c) 1983 
 
Missile Control is a Missile Command-style game. The player has to defend their cities from incoming 
bombs fire by alien spaceships. 
 
The player controls a cursor on the screen which indicates the direction of fire for the defense 
missiles. Once launched, they travel in a straight line from the launcher through the point the 
player specified until they hit an object. Each level is won by destroying all alien spaceships. The 
player loses once all their cities are destroyed. Bonus cities can be obtained by destroying a 
sufficient number of alien spacecraft. 
 
The game gets progressively harder, for example bombs will fall faster and energy barriers might 
protect the aliens from the player's attacks. To get around the barriers, players can deflect their 
shots from large defense missiles launched at the sides of the screen.

Mission 3000 is an arcade action game where you control the space ship Thunderhawk on a mission to 
destroy enemy starbases. On each level, there are six heavily guarded starbases which you need to 
locate and destroy. To help out, at the bottom of the screen is a scanner which shows the location of 
the Thunderhawk as well as the starbases. In the main view, the Thunderhawk is visible at the center 
of the screen which will scroll to follow your movement. To destroy the starbases and numerous 
attacking starfighters, the Thunderhawk is equipped with lasers which can be fired in eight different 
directions. When all six starbases have been destroyed, you are awarded an extra life before moving 
on to the next, more difficult level. The game ends when all of your lives have been lost.

You play as a treasure hunter named Panama Joe, whose goal is to find an ancient treasure hidden by 
Aztec warrior  deep inside catacombs. But beware, the catacombs are a large maze inhabited by 
monsters. Bouncing and rolling skulls, dancing spiders, disappearing and re-appearing chains and tons 
of fire await you. You'll have to find many keys and unlock doors in order to reach your goal. Panama 
Joe can jump and climb ladders, but doesn't have much to offer in terms of combat. That's why the 
monsters in the game should be avoided: a collision with an enemy leads to a premature death.

In Moonsweeper your goal is to rescue miners from the moons in Star Quadrant Jupiter. You begin your 
mission in space where you must avoid deadly aurora flares, photon torches and space bullets from the 
sun in this quadrant. From time to time you will see a moon pass by, and by flying near it you can 
descend to the surface. As you sweep along the surface, you will see stranded miners which need to be 
rescued by flying over them. Also on the moons surface are various obstacles which must be avoided or 
destroyed, such as towers and lunar satellites as well as alien surface destroyers. Should you 
survive and rescue six miners (the maximum your ship can carry), then you may take off from the 
surface by using the accelerator rings. There are several different types of moons found in this 
quadrant, each with a different level of difficulty. To help out, your ship is equipped with photon 
torpedoes and shields (though you will lose points while using the shield).

Motocross Racer is a bike racing game where you need to race through three different scenes in the 
shortest amount of time possible. Each scene takes place in a different location with a different 
perspective. First you will race through the desert with a 3-D behind the bike point of view. Rocks, 
cacti, scorpions, and other obstacles should be avoided or you'll crash and lose valuable time. Next 
you'll race a winding path uphill through the woods. This section has a top down view, and you'll 
lose time if you wander off the track or crash into obstacles. The final segment of the race takes 
place on the beach with a side scrolling point of view. Various obstacles and other racers will all 
get in your way here! If you crash too many times, or take too long the game will be over.

Deep within a multi platformed diamond mine is a valuable crown. Your goal is to locate and retrieve 
the crown, then make it to the top of the mine alive! There are several steps that need to be 
completed before you can retrieve the crown. First you need to collect enough diamonds to earn 1,000 
points. After you have enough points, you need to locate the flame spirit which is hidden somewhere 
within the mine. Since the mine is rather dark, you carry a flashlight with you which can be used to 
locate objects (such as treasure chests full of diamonds and the flame spirit.) Once you have the 
flame spirit, you need to find the entrance to the temple the crown is in. Offer the flame spirit to 
the skull spirit guarding the entrance, and you can get in and take the crown. Once you have the 
crown, you need to make it to the top of the mine before time runs out. To make this task more 
challenging, numerous cave bats fly around which can steal the crown. If this happens, you need to 
begin again! At the very bottom of the mine is a deadly spider

Ms. Pac-Man (1982) (Atari) (c) 1982 General Computer Corporation|Midway / Atari, Inc. 
 
In 1982, a sequel to the  incredibly popular Pac-Man was introduced in the form of his girlfriend, 
Ms. Pac-Man.  This sequel continued on the "eat the dots/avoid the ghosts" gameplay of the original 
game, but added new features to keep the title fresh. 
 
Like her boyfriend, Ms. Pac-Man attempts to clear four various and challenging mazes filled with dots 
and ever-moving bouncing fruit  while avoiding Inky, Blinky, Pinky and Sue, each with their own 
personalities and tactics.  One touch from any of these ghosts means a loss of life for Ms. Pac-Man. 
 
Ms. Pac-Man can turn the tables on her pursuers by eating one of the four Energizers located 
    within the maze. During this time, the ghosts turn blue, and Ms. Pac-Man can eat them for bonus 
    points (ranging from 200, 400, 800 and 1600, progressively). The Energizer power only lasts for a 
    limited amount of time, as the ghost's eyes float back to their center box, and regenerate to 
    chase after Ms. Pac-Man again. 
 
Survive a few rounds of gameplay, and the player will be treated to humorous intermissions showing 
the growing romantic relationship between Pac-Man and Ms. Pac-Man, leading all the way up to the 
arrival of "Junior".

Robots, bats, and spiders chase you around a maze in Night Stalker, which boasts similar gameplay, if 
some what slower, to the arcade smash Berzerk. Players must pick up a gun that is randomly placed in 
the maze. The gun provides the player with a certain number of shots. Once depleted, the gun is again 
placed in a random part of the maze.

No Escape! (1983) (Imagic) (c) 1983 Imagic / Imagic 
 
Jason has taken the Golden Fleece from the gods! They are naturally upset and have imprisoned Jason 
in the Temple of Aphrodite with deadly Furies running overhead. You control Jason and your goal is to 
eliminate all of the Furies to move on to the next level. The Furies can be destroyed if they are hit 
with a magical brick from the roof of the temple. You are armed with an unlimited supply of stones, 
throwing a stone at the roof will cause a brick to  fall (be careful, you'll lose a life if you hit 
yourself with a falling brick instead of the Furies). When a Fury is hit by a brick it is destroyed, 
but if you accidentally hit a Fury with a stone then it will multiply! The Furies will also be firing 
at you, and if you'll lose a life if hit. The game ends when you have no more lives left in reserve. 
Several difficulty levels are available.

Obelix (1983) (Atari) (c) 1983 Atari, Inc. / Atari, Inc. 
 
A classic Asterix & Obelix game where you simultaneously play as (both) Asterix and Obelix 
maintaining their favorite Gaulish sport of thumping the living daylights out of Roman soldiers. 
 
The objective of the game is to help Asterix "stun" Roman soldiers (simply by running into them, and 
they turn white from blue) while you command good ol'Obelix to throws his oversized Menhirs down at 
stunned Romans with a splat. 
 
If by any chance a stunned soldier is not whacked by a flying menhir, they turn "red" and hostile, 
which means Asterix is in trouble. In any case, he needs some good ol' magic potion from Getafix in 
order to defeat the "red" Romans, so be ready to catch some when Getafix comes knocking. 
 
There are 2 types of Roman soldiers to thump: the fat legionnaires and the small centurions. 
Centurions are worth more points.

Off the Wall (1989) (Atari) (c) 1989 Atari Corporation / Atari Corporation 
 
Off The Wall is an arcade action game with Breakout style gameplay. You control Kung Fu Lu, whose 
mission is to destroy a mysterious, evil wall by reflecting a bouncing ball into the bricks that make 
up the wall. When the bricks are hit by the ball, they are destroyed. On the top of the screen is a 
mystical dragon which guards the wall. Each level can be completed by either destroying all of the 
bricks in the wall, or hitting the dragon six times with the ball. Once the first level is completed, 
a blackbird will also appear on screen just below the wall. The blackbird will deflect the ball, and 
tries to get in the way to make your mission more difficult. From time to time, a magic token will 
fall downward which gives you special powers if caught. These can make the ball magnetic and follow 
your player, give you a larger paddle, or make the ball explosive and take out larger chunks of 
bricks. You start the game at a skill level of Peasant, and advance in rank every time four waves of 
bricks are cleared. You lose a life every time the ball falls off the bottoms of the screen, and the 
game ends when you lose all five of your lives.

Oscar's Trash Race (1983) (Atari) (c) 1983 Children's Computer Workshop, Inc.|Atari, Inc. / Atari, 
Inc. 
 
It is the Grouch Day Picnic and three little grouches (Herman, Grungetta and Sloppy) want to win the 
Trash Race. 
 
Game one is a practice race. The trash truck dumps one to five items. One of the trash cans at the 
top will then have a number on it. Press the button on the controller for that can the use the arrow 
keys to move it to the trash. Once you get the trash, move the grouch back to the top. You get one 
point per race. There are three races per game then Oscar appears to congratulate the winner (in his 
own grouchy way). 
 
Game two is the same as game one except there will be a number on all three trash cans and you must 
select the one that corresponds to the number of items. 
 
Both games one and two are one player only. 
 
In games three and four, the truck dumps one to nine items. You again select the correct grouch but 
this time there are puddles, three in game three, several in game four. You get one point for each 
puddle you jump. If you step into a puddle, the grouch will play in it, delaying you. There are three 
races in game three, five in game four. 
 
In game five, you run races one after another until Slimey the inchworm gets from one side of the 
screen to the other. Once Slimey get to the other side, the races ends. There are several puddles. 
You get one point per puddle jumped and one point per race completed. 
 
Games six and seven are the same as five but it will rain sometimes. When it does, the puddles turn 
blue. If you jump a blue puddle, you get two points. 
 
The trash items are: 
bones 
hangers 
coffee mugs 
toothbrush (presumably used) 
old tin can 
old televisions 
old ten-gallon hats 
old telephones 
old tennis shoes 
old dress shoes 
junk mail

Out of Control (1983) (Avalon Hill) (c) 1983 Avalon Hill / Avalon Hill 
 
This is an obstacle race in a space ship. The ship controls in a rather Asteroids-like way, in that 
you push left or right to rotate and press fire to thrust. Once you stop thrusting, the ship does not 
immediately stop, although it will slow down on its own. To stop sooner, you have to face away from 
the direction you are traveling and thrust. 
 
First, you must pass a set number of hurdles. If there is a single hurdle, you must pass on the side 
indicated by the arrow. If there are two hurdles, you must pass in between them. If there are three, 
you can pass through them or go around. If you hit a hurdle, you must go back to the last 
successfully passed hurdle and do it again to continue. 
 
After the hurdles, you must pop ten space balloons by running in to them. They appear one at a time 
at random spots on the screen. After you pop all ten balloons, you must dock in the space dock to end 
the race. 
 
The difficulty switches are not used. You select your game variation by moving the joystick up or 
down. 
 
Game variations 
There are 28 variations. The odd numbered ones have fast maneuvering, the even numbered ones, slow. 
 
The number of hurdles also varies. The first two have 10 hurdles, the next two, 14, then 22 (twice), 
27 (twice), 35 (twice), 39 (four times), 47 (twice), 51 (twice), 54 (twice), 63 (twice), 64 (twice),

Pac-Kong plays very similar to Donkey Kong. The player controls an "adventurer" (called Kong in

Each level consists of a series of platforms that are interconnected by ladders. The only action the 
player can take besides moving around is pressing fire to make the hero jump. This is necessary to 
get across the gaps between some of the platforms. At the same time, the player has to avoid the 
smaller octopi as well as clouds of poison gas which move around the screen randomly. Once the player 
reaches one of the treasure chests at the top of the screen they won the level and a new round 
starts. 
 
Pac-Kong can also be played by two players in an alternating fashion.

One of the most popular and influential games of the 1980's, Pac-Man stars a little, yellow 
dot-muncher who works his way around to clear a maze of the various dots and fruit which inhabit the 
board. 
 
Pac-Man's goal is continually challenged by four ghosts: The shy blue ghost Bashful (Inky), the 
   trailing red ghost Shadow (Blinky), the fast pink ghost Speedy (Pinky), and the forgetful orange 
   ghost Pokey (Clyde).  One touch from any of these ghosts means a loss of life for Pac-Man. 
 
Pac-Man can turn the tables on his pursuers by eating of the four Energizers located within the 
   maze.  During this time, the ghosts turn blue, and Pac-Man can eat them for bonus points.  This 
   only lasts for a limited amount of time, as the ghost's eyes float back to their center box, and 
   regenerate to chase after Pac-Man again. 
 
Survive a few rounds of gameplay, and be treated to humorous intermissions between Pac-Man and the 
ghosts.

Phantom II - Pirate (2006) (Homebrew) (c) Nov 29, 2006 
 
This cartridge contains two games: Phantom II and Pirate. 
 
Phantom II: Come fly the not-so-friendly skies. 
Based on a 1979 Bally Midway coin-op game, you must fight your way through enemy planes to find and 
destroy the enemy bomber  within the time limit. Do not ram the enemies as you only have one life. In 
the night time scenes, the enemy is only visible when the radar sweeps over them. 
 
Pirate: 
Can you find the treasure of the evil pirate "Up" Chuck LeDuc? Beware! His bony corpse wanders the 
island looking to protect it! Also watch out for snakes and the voodoo priestess! 
 
Use your joystick to move about the island and use the button to fight, pick up an item, use an item 
and enter or exit the hut. You can carry nothing, a sword and/or a shovel but you must have the 
shovel when you reach the X that marks the treasure.

Phantom-Panzer (c) 1983 
 
In Phantom-Panzer, the player takes control of an assault vehicle in order to defend their "energy 
base" at the bottom of the screen from the attacking phantom tanks. 
 
The game consists of three phases: the first phase takes place in a city and looks like a maze. It 
offers relative protection with the building walls. The second phase has the enemy tanks crossing two 
bridges over a river, but there's practically no cover. In the third and final phase, it's an all-out 
battle with the phantom tanks aggressively charging in on the player's base and no obstacles to stop 
them. 
 
The player can only shoot one bullet at a time and has to destroy 20 tanks in each stage. Enemy 
bullets can be canceled by hitting them with one's own bullet. The player loses one life if they 
collide with one of the tanks or the enemy bullets. The game is over immediately, however, if an 
enemy tank or shell hits the player's energy base.

You start with your lover of a pedestal on the left and various items floating above you. You must 
shoot each item once to acquire it. If an item starts flashing, shoot it next because after a short 
time, you'll lose a chance. If you shoot an item a second time, you will lose it and a chance. Lose

are at the top of the screen, and need to take cake layers from the oven and drop them onto the 
platter. The cake layers are different sizes, and you must drop them such that each layer is the same 
size or smaller than the one beneath it. After you have created a cake, you need to top it off with a 
cherry. If you are unable to successfully create a cake with the layers in the proper order and a 
topped with a cherry before the platter reaches the right side of the screen, it will fall off the 
conveyor and you lose a life. The different size cake layers come out of the oven randomly, so if you 
get a size you don't want it can be dropped off at the right side of the screen until a layer you do 
want appears. Although you can build cakes of different sizes, bonus points are earned for building a 
perfect cake consisting of one large layer, one medium layer, one small layer, and a cherry. As the 
game progresses, the conveyor will pick up speed to make cake building tougher.

Pigs in Space starring Miss Piggy (1986) (Atari) (c) 1983 Atari, Inc. / Atari, Inc. 
 
Now it's time for...PIIIIIIGS IN SPAAAAACE!!! 
 
This game is really three smaller games. You select what to play to choosing which character you 
want. 
For Captain Link Hogthrob, it is Chickenvaders. A Pigs in Space take in Atari's Atari 2600 version of 
Space Invaders. 
While exploring the planet Cluck, our intrepid hero was set upon by space chickens. Captain Link must 
destroy them before they make their way all the way to the planet. He does this by firing link 
sausages up at the chickens. But the chickens are not helpless. They are dropping space chicken eggs. 
If one hits Link, he will be turned into...a chicken! You also lose a life. From time to time, Gonzo 
flies across the screen top in his saucer. You can hit him for points also. 
 
Scoring 
Hitting a chicken on... 
Row one=10 points 
Row two=20 points 
Row three=50 points 
Row four=70 points 
Row five=100 points 
Hitting Gonzo=300 points 
Destroying all the chickens=1000 point bonus 
 
If you select First Mate Piggy, you play Pastaroids. Somehow, Piggy has been ejected from the 
Swinetrek into a pastaroid storm. You must guide Piggy from the bottom of the screen to the top and 
board the Swinetrek before it leaves. If you touch a flying meatball or spaghetti strand, you will 
lose ground, and thus time. You can press fire to give a meat ball a karate chop for points but don't 
dawdle. 
 
Scoring 
Karate-chopping a meat ball=100 points 
Boarding the Swinetrek=1000 points 
 
If you select Dr. Strangepork, you play Escape from Planet of the Gonzoids. The Swinetrek has gotten 
trapped in an abandoned pizza mine still being guarded by robotic Gonzoids, created by Gonzo. The 
Gonzoids are standing on ledges, throwing pizzas across the mine, You have a weapon called the 
Boomeray. When you fire, it goes up then curves to the side, hopefully landing on a Gonzoid. The 
direction it curves depends on which way you move before you fire. If you are hit by a pizza, hit the 
mine walls or are hit by your dropping Boomeray shot, you lose a life. 
 
Scoring 
You get one point for every mile you get through the mine. 
Hitting a Gonzoid=100 points 
Escaping the mine=1000 points 
 
The difficulty switches do nothing. The only game selections are one player or two player, 
alternating.

score, while others are fatal. Rolling logs and falling down a hole will deduct points, and 
scorpions, alligators, snakes, bottomless pits, swamps, and fires will cause Pitfall Harry to lose a 
life. You have 20 minutes to try to collect all of the treasures on the numerous screens, if you can

Pooyan (1982) (Konami-Gakken) (c) 1982 Konami Industry Co. Ltd. / Konami, Inc. 
 
In this remake of the arcade game Pooyan from the early '80s, you play the role of a pig, protecting 
its piglets from wolves. 
 
The first screen takes place near the pigs' home.  Mrs. Pig rides up and down in a cable car, 
shooting at wolves, who are riding balloons downward, towards the ground.  If the wolves land safely 
on the ground, then they can climb a ladder, near the cable-car, and catch Mrs. Pig.  But if she 
shoots their balloons, they splat on the ground instead. 
 
The wolves shoot acorns at the pig.  But Mrs. Pig has a food based weapon too.  If she gets to the 
top, she can get meat, to toss at the wolves and make them jump off their balloons in pursuit.  Each 
wolf taken out this way is worth bonus points (on a doubling scheme: 400, 800 1600...) 
 
The second scene takes place at the wolves lair.  Here the wolves have reinforced balloons--it takes 
multiple hits to make them fall.  Here they float upwards toward a big rock, which they push on top 
of Mrs. Pig, when seven wolves are present.  Additionally, an alpha wolf (wolf leader) appears and 
summons wolves in packs.

Popeye (1983) (Parker Bros) (c) 1983 Nintendo Co., Ltd. / Parker Brothers 
 
Popeye is a conversion of the arcade action/platform game. As Popeye, you are trying to win Olive 
Oyl's love! She is at the top of the screen dropping tokens of her love, and you need to collect them 
before they hit the ground. After you have collected the required number of items, you can move on to 
the next, more difficult level. There are many obstacles trying to stop you from completing your 
task, though! Brutus wanders around the screen and is constantly trying to catch you. If you collect 
a can of spinach, you can temporarily knock him out, otherwise Brutus will knock you out. Other 
objects such as bottles or birds are also flying around the screen and will cause you to lose one of 
your lives if you are hit. Each level features a different layout of platforms and ladders, and will 
have you collecting different items as they float towards the bottom of the screen!

Pressure Cooker (1983) (Activision) (c) 1983 Activision, Inc. / Activision, Inc. 
 
In Pressure Cooker, you are a cook whose job is to fullfill hamburger orders at "The Grille". Along 
the bottom of the screen you will see the orders for various types of hamburgers come in. Tomotoes, 
onions, lettuce, and cheese may all be requested and you need to collect the proper ingredients, put 
them on a hamburger, and drop it in the wrapping machine. The hamburgers will be coming down the left 
side of the screen on a conveyer belt as all other ingredients come flying out of the dispensers on 
the right. Make sure you catch all the ingredients and don't let any hamburgers fall off the end of 
the conveyer belt, otherwise you'll lose performance points! If your performance score drops to zero, 
you will be fired and the game ends. Of course, the ingredients will rarely come out in the desired 
order, so you also have the ability to toss an ingredient back without losing performance points if 
necessary. As you successfully create the ordered hamburgers and drop them in the proper warpping 
machine, the game difficulty will increase by upping the speed of the conveyer belt and increasing 
the complexity of the orders.

Pressure Gauge (1999) (Homebrew) (c) 2000 
 
Pressure Guage's gameplay is a simple as its graphics, albeit not that easy to describe. On the left 
of the screen is a small colored line. On the right is a line that starts at the top of the screen 
and slowly descends. This is your timer. Next to the left line is a line that starts at the bottom 
and rises to the top. When it reaches the top, it restarts at the bottom. The object is to press your 
button when the rising line on the left is within the small line on the left. This will cause a new 
line to rise. If you press the button when the rising line is not in the left small line or let the 
rising line reach the top, the new line will lower. To clear the level, get the new line all the way 
to the top. If you do not get the new line to the top before the descending line on the right reaches 
the bottom, the game is over.

Rainbow Invaders (c) Jun 10, 2006 
 
It's the year 3006, and the evil “Rainbow Invaders” from the planet “Pacco”, are headed to Earth! 
They look like the ridiculous aliens depicted in 1980’s arcade games, but are extremely dangerous and 
their goal is to exterminate all humans! You command a fleet of spaceships and you must defeat all of 
the Invaders to save Earth! Good luck! 
 
This game is inspired by the game Space Invaders but with a twist. Yes, there are rows of invaders 
moving across the screen then moving down, firing as they go. Yes, your ship moves left and right at 
the bottom of the screen, firing up. Yes, an enemy ship will travel across the top of the screen. But 
there, the similarities end. For one thing, there are no shields to hide behind. Your ship does have 
a shield you activate by pulling back on the joystick but be warned, it drains all your energy so 
when you use it, after it is gone, you cannot move or fire for a second. 
 
Also, the aliens are not dropping just electric shots. They also drop any of sixteen Special Shots. 
Some of these will help you, most will hinder you. 
 
The Special Shots do the following: 
 
1. Your ship's movements and shots become faster. Duration: ten seconds 
2. Your ship's left/right movements are inverted. Duration: until you grab a different Special 
   Shot or lose your current life. 
3. Your ship's movements and shots become slower. Duration: until you grab a different Special 
   Shot or lose your current life. 
4. Enemies do not fire. Duration: ten seconds 
5. Inavders' electric shots descend at maximum speed. Duration: until you grab a different Special 
   Shot or lose your current life. 
6. Invaders' electric shots track your ship. Duration: until you grab a different Special Shot or 
   lose your current life. 
7. Invaders stop moving. Duration: five seconds 
8. Invaders move very fast. Duration: one second 
9. All shots, your and the invaders, become invisible. Duration: ten seconds 
10. If you shoot at an invader or the enemy ship and miss, a randomly generated invader could 
    appear. And your “Shoot Abort” option, wherein when you shoot again the last shot disappears, is 
    temporary disabled. Duration: thirty seconds 
11. Your ship freezes. Duration: one second 
12. Invaders’ electric shots follow a random path. Duration: until you grab a different Special 
    Shot or lose your current life. 
13. Your shots follow a random path. Duration: until you grab a different Special Shot or lose 
    your current life. 
14. Your shots don’t stop when they hit an enemy but continue straight to the top of the screen, 
    killing any enemies it hits. Duration: five seconds 
15. A randomly chosen invader blinks. If you don’t blast it immediately, every few moments a new 
    invader is randomly generated. Duration: thirty seconds 
16. A randomly chosen invader blinks. If you don’t blast it before the bonus expires, your ship 
    will explode. Duration: ten seconds. Meaning you have ten seconds to shoot that invader or lose a 
    life

bars to drive them back, preferably off the screen. If a bar starts flashing, it is a bonus bar and 
shooting it gets you larger points as well as clearing it from the screen completely. Be warned, 
though, that sometimes the bar will reappear on the opposite side of the screen. 
 
A round ends when: 
1. You have cleared all the colored bars from the screen or 
2. The timer at the bottom, which starts at five thousand, reaches zero or 
3. The colored bars have blocked off part of the screen and you clear the rods where you can 
 
After three rounds, the game is over.

Rampage! (1989) (Activision) (c) 1989 Bally Midway Manufacturing Co., Inc. / Activision, Inc. 
 
George, Lizzy and Ralph were just ordinary Americans, until an experiment went wrong, turning them 
into a Gorilla, Lizard and Werewolf respectively. Following this, the three of them plan to go round 
destroying buildings, and up to 3 human players can join in. 
 
Smashing at the edges of the buildings for long enough will make them collapse. The police and 
military are after you, and will shoot at you, so try to destroy them (failing that, you can avoid 
the bullets). You will need to eat regularly, with things like plants on offer, to avoid shrinking 
back to being human

Raster Fahndung (c) Dec 14, 2007 
 
You are presented with a screen full of squares, thirty-two squares wide by twenty squares high. The 
object of the game is to find a particular set of squares that measure six by six squares. This 
sounds simple but you are timed. You can view the pattern you need by pressing fire but don't stay 
long as this makes the timer speed up to twice as fast while you are in that screen. In a two player 
game, the first player to find the correct pattern collects one point. The game ends when the timer 
runs out or, in two player, one player reaches nine points. 
 
You start with ninety seconds. If you select the easy difficulty, the second puzzle with have five 
less seconds. Time decreases per screen until you reach twenty seconds, the lowest time. On the hard 
setting, you have to clear as many boards as you can in ninety seconds, total.

you are trying to stop from melting down! The reactor core at the center of the screen is surrounded 
by a deadly kill wall. Roaming throughout the available space are positrons, neutrinos, and photons, 
all of which will be trying to knock your ship into the wall. To survive you will need to knock all 
of these attacking particles into the kill wall to destroy them. As each level progresses, the 
reactor core will slowly grow in size, making less and less room to maneuver in. Eventually the 
reactor core will melt down

Terra I supplies Earth with Zenbar crystals, which is used to supply 72% of the power to Earth. 
Ordinarily, a computer controls the defense systems but it looks to have been sabotaged. Space 
pirates are in the area and the robot interceptors are working against us. Your orders are to fly 
your F-117 Starwarrior to Terra I, destroying anything that tries to harm you. 
 
You can move your ship up, down, left or right. You begin with a top-down view if the F-117, facing 
towards the bottom of the screen. Meteors and later space pirates come from the bottom moving up and 
you must shoot them. After you get through these, you switch to a side view of the ship and face left 
or right. Robot interceptors will come from the sides and must be destroyed then fish force fields 
(yes, fish force fields) will come from the top, moving down and you must shoot the fish-shaped 
devices to destroy them. They are Terra I's last defensive line so when you get through them, you 
win. 
 
In the two player games, player one controls the F-117's left and right movement and player two 
controls the up and down movement therefore players must work together. Firing alternates between 
both players in two second intervals.

You're the pilot of an F-14 assault jet, assigned to the dangerous mission of taking out an enemy 
bridge at the top of a heavily guarded river. In River Raid II, the gameplay is similar to the 
original River Raid, but with a few additions. For each mission you start out on an aircraft carrier. 
After a successful takeoff, you need to get past enemy forces located over the ocean which guard the 
entrance to the river. Make sure to collect plenty of fuel from the refueling jets, since once you 
reach the river fuel will become scarce! Next you will have to make your way up the treacherous river 
channel until you finally reach, and hopefully destroy, the bridge. But the level isn't over yet, for 
now  you have to return to the aircraft carrier and land safely. After completing all of this, you 
move on to the next, more challenging level. In addition to the expanded levels, another change in 
River Raid II is the ability to control the altitude of your plane. You can fly high above 
everything, or fly low into the channel to take out enemy tanks and barges.

long, the monster becomes immune to your weapon. 
 
There are sixty-four game variations. In some, the gunmen shoot in a straight line only, others they 
aim at where ever you are, others are slow, others fast, others the portals all open at the same time 
and stay open, others various portals open and close. 
 
Scoring 
Shoot a gunman=75 points per gunman 
Stun a monster=50 points each time

Rush Hour (1983) (CommaVid) (c) Aug 09, 2003 CommaVid, Inc. / CGE Services Corporation 
 
It's rush hour and you're in a hurry, but there's a major traffic jam.  You race along a five-lane 
freeway, in control of a car equipped with weapons, on a mission to destroy certain carrier cars 
which are causing traffic jams.  You must weave in and out of traffic at high speeds blasting 
slow-moving cars in your path to reach your destination.  Along the way, you must also avoid 
obstacles such as destroyed cars, barricades, nails, and  oil slicks on the road.  A radar tracks the 
enemy and warns of coming danger. 
 
Collisions with other vehicles and objects will damage your car and cause malfunction.  The car will 
repair itself slowly as time lapses, or you may pull over for a quick repair, but you may let your 
target escape if you take too long.  You only have one car, and the game is over when this car is 
lost.

You are Hotot, a cybernetic life form from a serene planet in a distant galaxy. Unfortunately, even 
in a galaxy far far away not everything is as peaceful as it first seems, for Hotot has discovered an 
alien missile base hidden on his planet. Manned by strange blue aliens, these evil intruders are 
using your planet as a launching site for their deadly warhead which is posed to destroy the galaxy's 
power source. With the help of the birdlike Gorfons, you must destroy the warhead, and prevent the 
destruction of the galaxy! Good luck Hotot. You are the Saboteur. 
 
On the first screen, you are trying to prevent the Qotile construction robots and Yar slaves from 
completing a missile. You will be helped by the Gorfrons. While the Qotile construction robots and 
Yar slaves will build up the missile, the Gorfrons will steal pieces to lower it. Beware of the 
Master robot on the top catwalk as it will try to shoot you and the Gorfrons to prevent your 
interference. After you finish the Rocket Construction Site, it is off to Warhead Assembly. 
 
In Warhead Assembly, you must destroy the warhead parts on the conveyor belt. There is just one 
little problem

Some whales are traveling from the Arctic Ocean to Baja to breed. The bad news is a whaling ship in 
the area is attacking them. You must use your submarine to shoot the nets or harpoons and radioactive 
debris to save the whales. 
 
After you start the game, the whales will move from left to right along the bottom of the screen. The 
ship will start throwing down nets or harpoons, depending on the settings, to kill the whales. You 
must aim at the nets, in any direction and shoot them. After several nets/harpoons have been sent, 
radioactive debris will flow from the right side on the screen. This is up too high to hurt the 
whales but it can hurt you. You must shoot it as well. If your sub gets hit five times, the game is 
over. In a two-player game, one player is the sub and the other is the whaling ship.

This game is inspired by the Brøderbund game Seafox and the Midway coin-op games Sea Wolf and Sea 
Wolf II, although it is not a direct conversion of any of them. 
 
You are a submarine along the bottom of the sea. You must sink ships with your torpedoes. 
 
You move your sub left or right with the joystick and launch a torpedo with the button. Try to shoot 
past the mines as they waste torpedoes and give no points. Try to hit ships, destroyers, enemy subs 
and PT boats. Try to avoid hitting the white ships as these will cause your torpedoes to rebound back 
down. You have fifty torpedoes and ninety-nine fuel. You lose a life when you run out of fuel. After 
three lives, the game is over.

This is when the boats on the water below you will stop moving and you need to get above them and

Secret Quest (1989) (Atari) (c) 1989 Axlon / Atari Corporation 
 
It started with one station, then three, then eight. If something isn't done, the aliens will overrun 
Earth. It is up to you to destroy the stations by setting their self destructs. 
 
You move from room to room, fighting any enemies you encounter. When you beat an enemy, you get an 
energy pod or oxygen bottle. Fighting aliens depletes you energy and/or oxygen so kill quickly. You 
also use oxygen at the rate of one bottle per minute while exploring. 
 
Along the way, you will sometimes find sonic keys, and energy sword, sonic blaster or particle beam. 
Sonic keys are needed for certain doors you encounter in later stations. 
 
Once you set the self destruct code, a clock starts and you must make it to the teleporter before the 
time runs out. The game ends when you destroy all eight stations, run out of oxygen or do not get off 
a station before it self destructs. If you run out of energy, the game does not end but you will not 
be able to use any weapon so you can't kill monsters so you can't replenish oxygen. Hence, the game 
won't go long if you run out of energy. 
 
Weapon energy use and damage 
Energy sword=1 energy and 2 strength 
Sonic blaster=2 energy and 4 strength 
Particle beam=4 energy and 8 strength.

you need to free them. To do this, a glowing orb called the Sentinel has been sent which can absorb 
the alien energy. As the Sentinel floats above the various, scrolling landscapes, you need to protect 
it from attacks by using the light gun to destroy enemies and enemy fire. If you don't destroy an 
enemy, it will deplete the Sentinels energy supply which will eventually destroy it. There are four 
levels of increasing difficulty, each with a large boss at the end. To help out on your mission, 
several bonuses may be encountered from time to time

Shuttle Orbiter (1983) (Avalon Hill) (c) 1983 Avalon Hill / Avalon Hill 
 
You must get ten parts from an orbiting factory to an incomplete space station. Unfortunately, a 
comet passed near Earth and left a space debris field that you will need to avoid. 
 
After the launch, you will see the Earth being circled but four colored dots. At the bottom will be 
the elapsed time, remaining fuel and four indicator bars. These bars are your orbit altitudes and 
their colors correspond to the colors of the orbiting dots: white for the shuttle, gold for the 
station, red for the orbiting factory, and green for the fuel depot. 
 
When you are lower in orbit than an item, you move faster. If you are higher than an item, you move 
slower. You must match orbit and location with something to dock. Once you are close to something, 
you switch to the maneuvering display. Now you can interact with an item or avoid it, as in the 
debris. If you hit something, whether debris or man-made orbiting item, you begin to leak fuel. This 
means you will use fuel even if you are not firing thrusters. You also have a 25% chance to damage 
the part in the cargo hold. 
 
Game variations 
The difficulty switches and select switch are not used. After you press fire on the joystick, move 
the stick up or down to select the difficulty level, from 0 to 3. Game 0 has no space debris. 
 
There is no score, just the amount of time it takes you and whether or not you got all ten parts in 
place without running out of fuel.

screens. First you are outside the castle which is guarded by numerous flying creatures. You need to 
fly around the screen and destroy all of the creatures by hitting them with your lance (careful, if 
they hit you instead you'll lose a life). After all of the creatures are gone, you enter the second 
screen which is inside the castle. Here there is a large pit of lava and a flying dragon. To destroy 
the dragon you need to hit it's stomach with your lance. If you are hit by one of the dragon's 
fireballs you'll be temporarily stunned and unable to fly. If you end up falling into the lava, 
you'll lose a life. If you can defeat the dragon, the game repeats at a higher difficulty level. The 
game ends when you lose all of your lives.

When you are on your board, just push the direction you want to turn. Press fire to jump and press 
and hold fire to jump and land in a crouched position. You will also see rails, walls and hurdles but 
these you must avoid as they will make you crash. 
 
To jump a ramp, just ride towards it and be aligned with it. To clear a tube, ride through it while 
crouched. If you ride through grass, it will slow you down. To get back up to speed, either crash 
into something or ride through grass until you stop then get the skateboard going again.

animals will be out of their cages and you just touch each one to rescue it. The animal cages will 
only be open for a limited time, then the gorilla will get back on its feet. You must then knock it 
down again. 
 
You mustn't take too long rescuing the animals or you will run out of fuel. If you run out of fuel, 
run into a gorilla or the course walls or, strangely, a cloud, you lose a plane. You begin the game 
with four planes. 
 
Difficulty switches 
Set to A for faster plane, set to B for slower plane. 
 
Game variations 
Game 1...Tricky flying course 
Game 2...Tricky flying course and clouds 
Game 3...Tricky flying course, clouds and faster plane. 
 
Scoring 
Knock a gorilla of its feet=10 points 
Rescue any one animal=100 points 
Rescue one of each of the four types of animals, consecutively (1 cat, 1 turtle, 1 rabbit, 1 
duck)=500 points 
 
You get an extra plane every 10,000 points.

The goal of this two-players console game is to move your vehicle in a maze so you can shoot missiles 
at your opponent without getting shot at. 
 
The games features four different mazes to choose from, each faster than the last. Another feature 
lets you decide to make the missiles faster or slower than the car. The difficulty switch determines 
whether you can shoot a missile while one of your own is still on the screen. Otherwise, your missile 
has to hit the enemy or be retrieved by your vehicle before you can launch another one. 
 
You steer your car with a joystick. Each time you hit your enemy with a missile, you get a point. The 
fist player to get 25 points is the winner.

Smurfs Save the Day (1983) (Coleco) (c) 1983 Coleco / Coleco 
 
In this children's learning game, you learn music, sorting and color mixing. 
 
With Harmony Smurf, the computer will play four, five or six notes and you must repeat them. After 
the notes play, they fall to the ground and you must put them in their correct spots. The highest 
level has invisible notes, you must match by sound only. 
 
There are two modes, changed by the select switch. 
In Game Mode, the computer plays and you must duplicate it. In Toy Mode, there are six notes on the 
ground and you can make any tune you like, the computer doesn't create a tune. 
 
With Handy Smurf, items will move along a conveyor belt and you must sort them into one of three 
bins. You press the button to close or open gaps to guide the object but don't press too soon or the 
gap returns to the way it was before after a short time. 
 
In Game Mode, the first five items are sorted by shape, the next five by size and the next five by 
color then the sequence repeats only faster. In Toy Mode, after each item is sorted, the sorting 
criteria (shape, size or color) changes randomly. 
 
With Greedy Smurf, Clumsy Smurf has a colored liquid in a glass. Using blue, red, yellow and white 
spigots, Greedy must put the same color liquid or mix liquids to get the same color in his glass. If 
he gets it right, he and Clumsy drink up. If he gets it wrong, the glass drains out. 
 
In Game Mode, the colors start easy and get progressively harder. In Toy Mode, the color selection in 
Clumsy's glass is random. 
 
There is no time limit or penalty if you get something wrong.

The game play remains the same. The aliens move left and right and down, dropping bombs at you. You

You are an assault ship that was designed to destroy Hyperion military bases. 
 
You must shoot the bases enough so that the energy meter at the bottom goes from the "+" to the "-". 
Once the meter gets to "-" the base will explode. 
 
Obviously, the base is not a sitting duck. There is a force field that expands and contracts, base 
defenders and , in higher rounds, shields. The force field has a gap in it that you can shoot through 
or you can maneuver inside the field and shoot the base up close. Be careful, though, because you can 
get caught within the field. 
 
If you touch a shield, the force field, the base or are touched by a defender, you lose a life. 
 
The defenders are fireballs, heat seekers, bouncers, wanderers, and homers. 
 
The scoring is as follows: 
Destroy a fireball = 25 Points 
Destroy a heat seeker = 100 Points 
Destroy a bouncer = 50 Points 
Destroy a wanderer = 200 Points 
Destroy a homer = 400 Points 
 
You also get 25 points for each hit you get on the base. 
 
When you destroy the first four bases, you get 1,000 points per base

Space Shuttle - Journey into Space (1983) (Activision) (c) 1983 Activision, Inc. / Activision, Inc. 
 
Space Shuttle is a simulation game where you are the pilot of space shuttle Discovery. Your goal is 
to launch the Discovery, establish an orbit around the Earth, open the cargo bay doors and recover a 
satellite to perform repairs, and finally land the Discovery successfully, all while using as little 
fuel as possible. Each time the complete mission is accomplished, it will then repeat at a higher 
difficulty level (in the higher difficulty levels the satellite has a more erratic flight path). The 
game is played from a first person perspective in the space shuttle cockpit where you can control 
everything from the shuttles engines to cargo bay doors. When the game is over you will be given a 
ranking which is based on the number of successful dockings and the amount of fuel that was used. In 
addition to the full flight mode, two easier game variations (autosimulator and simulator mode) are 
included. The autosimulator mode is the easiest

Space Treat (c) Aug 10, 2002 
 
Your planet has done well but your neighbors have not so they have attacked and stolen your food. It 
is in a space cage. You must make your way past them to return the food to your planet. 
 
You start at the bottom of the screen, on your base. You must push up to launch from your base, at 
which point you will begin consuming fuel. You must then make your way through drones that are moving 
left or right to the space cage at the top of the screen. When you are at the opening of the cage, 
where the food is, push up to retrieve it. Once you have the food, you must make your way back 
through  the drones to your base before you run out of fuel. If you die,  for whatever reason, before 
you return to your base with the food, you must restart the level at the bottom. 
 
If your fuel gets too low (the indicator will turn red) your ship will actually slow down. Starting 
with level three, you must first grab a passkey from among the drones to open the cage and then go 
get the food and return.

Spiderdroid (c) 1987 Froggo Games Corporation / Froggo Games Corporation 
 
It's the future, when droids do battle.  You send your Spiderdroid in to capture a building by 
covering the structure with its unbreakable Droidweb. Your Spiderdroid lays down a web strand as it 
crawls along each girder. Once you have strung a web strand completely around an opening, the 
Spiderdroid flings a web over that opening.  Your objective is to travel all the building's girders 
so the entire structure is caught in your Droidweb. 
 
But watch out!  The building is swarming with Birddroids out to have your Spiderdroid for lunch.  If 
you get cornered, use your secret weapon! Press the Joystick's button to cast a magic spell that 
makes the Birddroids invisible and unable to eat you... but only for a few seconds.  And remember - 
each of your Spiderdroids can cast only four magic spells. Once you capture the first building, it's 
time to send your advanced Mummydroid to capture the next one, which is guarded by a horde of 
Skeledroids!

Spider Fighter is an arcade style action game somewhat similar to Space Invaders. You control a bug 
blaster at the bottom of the screen, and need to defend the three pieces of fruit at the top right of 
the screen. Various types of attacking spiders scurry around rapidly, trying to destroy your blaster 
and steal the fruit. If all of your fruit is stolen or you lose all of your bug blasters, the game is 
over. When all the spiders on a round are destroyed, you move on to the next, faster round. If you 
still have all three pieces of fruit when a round is completed, you receive an extra bug blaster.

The Green Goblin has set a super bomb at the top of a high voltage tower located on the top of a 
skyscaper! As Spider-Man, you need to scale the building and defuse the bomb. Use your web to climb 
the building, but be careful of Green Goblin's villians which appear in the windows trying to stop 
you. If your web line goes too close to a villian, it will be cut and Spider-Man will fall. If you're 
careful, you can swing back and forth to capture the villians for bonus points. When you reach the 
top of the building, it's time to climb up the high voltage tower which is booby trapped with bombs. 
The bombs can be defused or avoided to get to the top, but just make sure you aren't too close to one 
that explodes! Once you arrive at the top of the tower, Green Goblin himself will be protecting the 
super bomb he has planted there. If you can sneak past Green Goblin and defuse the super bomb, the 
level is complete and you then move on to the next, more challenging level.

view. Your car is equipped with machine guns to help you get past the numerous enemies out on the 
road (be careful not to shoot any civilians, though!) Occasionally you will come across a weapons 
van, and if you drive into the back of the van your car becomes equipped with a second weapon (such 
as smoke screen, oil slick, or missiles.) At several points the road splits and you can enter a 
boathouse which transforms your car into a boat temporarily. If you drive far enough the seasons 
change as well (watch out for icy conditions during winter!) The enemy cars will do anything to stop 
you, including running you off the road, firing guns from the back of a limmo, or dropping bombs from 
a helicopter.

through the holes in the fortress bricks. 
 
The snakes will slither from one side on the screen to the other then come the opposite way one level 
lower. You cannot kill the snake but you can shorten it when you shoot it. Your gun runs on a gun 
track inside the fortress walls and always shoots away from the fortress. You cannot shoot through 
the bricks themselves, only in between them.

In game one, the snakes enter the screen from one side but move fast. In game two, they enter from 
any side but move slower. Either way, you only have one life. Player two begins after player one by 
just pressing the button on the right joystick. If there is no player two or after player two dies, 
then you must press reset to play again.

humanoids before Landers can turn them into Mutants, while avoiding and shooting other foes, however 
you must now carry humanoids to safety through the Stargate of the title.

lives if you warp with 10 humanoids, so there is a trade-off between guaranteeing the safety of 
existing humanoids, and trying to advance your position

A cockpit view space shooter very similar to Star Raiders but not requiring a keypad. In your 
starship, you must warp to sectors of space containing enemy starships. Here you will engage and 
destroy them before they can surround and destroy your starbases.   In a starbase sector, use your 
joystick to guide your reticle to the starbase when it is near you for repair and/or refueling. In a 
fight, you can take damage. If you see a L, it meas your lasers are out of commission. This mean you 
cannot fire (this is not good in a fight!). If you see a W, it means your warp drive is damaged. You 
will use twice as much fuel when warping. If you see an S, it means your shields are out. If you are 
hit again with no shields, you will be destroyed. If you see an R, it means your radar is damaged. 
You will not be able to see the enemies on the starmap until you get the radar fixed. All your 
starbases will still show with damaged radar except any that have been destroyed. When warping, if 
the screen at the bottom is green, you are headed to an empty sector. If it is red, you are headed to 
a sector with enemies in it. If it is blue, you are headed to a sector with a starbase in it. The 
game ends when either all the enemies are destroyed or you are destroyed. Your final score is 
determined by your base score plus 100 points per enemy destroyed minus 500 points per starbase 
destroyed minus 100 points per each time you docked at a starbase minus 1 point per stardate.

Enterprises, Inc. 
 
Star Trek: Strategic Operations Simulator is an arcade action game where you take control of the 
Starship Enterprise. Your mission is to save the Federation from NOMAD! Before you get a chance at 
destroying NOMAD, you'll have to battle your way through ten levels (each consisting of multiple 
rounds). In each round you may encounter Klingon fighters, deadly anti-matter saucers, asteroid 
fields, and deadly meteors, all of which are capable of depleting the Enterprises energy. The game 
ends when your energy supply has completely run out. To fight these dangers, the Enterprise is 
equipped with an unlimited supply of phasers and a limited supply of photon torpedoes. Each round 
also contains one or more starbases

Star Wars - The Arcade Game (1983) (Parker Bros) (c) 1983 Atari, Inc. / Parker Brothers 
 
Conversion of Atari Games' first-person shoot 'em up based around the original Star Wars film. You 
take on the role of Luke Skywalker, aiming to destroy the Death Star - which, as any fan knows, 
involves attacking the 'weak spot' near the exhaust. To even get to this you have to pass swarms of 
TIE Fighters. Complete the game and it loops back around at ever-increasing difficulty. The game uses 
vector graphics, which allow lots of action at high speed on comparatively slow systems.

only with a light saber which is used to control the direction of the laser bolts you fire, as well 
as block incoming fire from your opponent. The first player to break through the other players shield 
wins a point, and the first player to 3 points wins the match! Several game options are included 
which control the speed of the seeker, or even make the seeker invisible.

Star Wars - Return of the Jedi - Death Star Battle (1983) (Parker Bros) (c) 1983 Parker Brothers /

"Death Star Battle" is loosely based on the events of "Star Wars, Part 6: Return of the Jedi". Your 
task is to destroy the Death Star before its construction is finished. You start the task outside the 
shield perimeter of the Death Star. There you'll have to combat different imperial vessels and avoid 
the death ray while waiting for an opportunity to slip through one of the random openings in the 
energy shield. After reaching the Death Star you must reduce its structure up to the point where you 
can hit the core. In the following blow up of the station you must avoid collision with Death Star 
debris. 
 
After successful destruction the game will restart with increased difficulty (faster enemies, faster 
Death Star build up, etc). 
 
Overall difficulty can also be adjusted before starting the game.

Star Wars: The Empire Strikes Back recreates a scene from the movie of the same name. You are on the 
icy planet of Hoth, and Imperial Walkers are closing in on the rebel power generator. As the pilot of 
a snowspeeder, you need to take out as many of the walkers as you can. The walkers are heavily 
armoured, and it will take a lot of fire power to destroy one! The game is played on a large, 
scrolling screen with a radar screen at the bottom to help keep track of where the enemy is located. 
If a walker reaches the power generator, or you run out of snowspeeders the game is over. Good luck, 
and may the force be with you!

Steeple Chase (1983) (Video Gems) (c) 1980 Atari, Inc. / Sears, Roebuck and Co. 
 
This is a hurdles horse race. 
 
The horse's names, from bottom to top, are: Lucky Devil, Absent Mind, Just Missed and Little 
Dictator. You play as one of the jockeys and must reach the right side of the screen first. The horse 
runs and hurdles come at you from the right. To jump these hurdles, you turn the paddle to set the 
height of the jump, as indicated by the marker on the right. You press the button to jump. The better 
you jump, the faster your horse goes. After 3 minutes, if no one has gotten all the way to the right, 
the race ends and whoever was in the lead wins. 
 
There are 6 game variations. In games 1, 2 and 3, the distance between the hurdles is uniform with 
the computer-controlled horse's racing ability being poor, good and excellent, respectively. 
In games 4, 5 and 6, the the distance between the hurdles is random with the computer-controlled 
horse's racing ability being poor, good and excellent, respectively.

Stellar Track (1980) (Sears) (c) 1981 Atari, Inc. / Sears, Roebuck and Co. 
 
This is an Atari 2600 version of a Star Trek game found on many college mainframes. 
 
Like those mainframe programs, it has no graphics, only text. You use the joystick, moving left or 
right, to select the command you want then press the red button. You then move the joystick left or 
right to select set the parameters of that command, if there are any. You start by pressing Reset or 
Select to choose how many enemies you must kill in how many stardates. 
 
The commands and any settings are as follows: 
 
Galaxy Map=a 6x6 grid that starts out empty until you do a long range scan. Afterwards, the quadrants 
will show a 2 digit number. The left digit is the number of aliens in the area. The right digit will 
either be a 1 or a zero, depending on whether there is or is not a starbase in that area. Galaxy map 
costs you no energy or stardates. 
 
LR Scan=Long range scan. This will tell you what is in your quadrant and all the quadrants next to 
yours. If there are any enemies in your quadrant when you do an LR scan, they will attack you. LR 
scan does not cost energy or stardates but it does take a turn. 
 
SR Scan=Short range scan. This shows you the stars, aliens and starbases in your quadrant. You need 
to do this to destroy aliens and dock with starbases. Like LR Scan, if there are aliens in your 
quadrant, they will attack after you use SR Scan. Also, like LR Scan, SR Scan does not cost energy or 
stardates but it does take a turn. 
 
Warp=Warp is how you move, either from quadrant to quadrant or from sector to sector within a 
quadrant. You move by setting 2 settings. The first is your direction. You select a direction based 
on the numbers below: 
8  1  2 
\ | / 
7--*--3 
/ | \ 
6  5  4 
Next, you select how many quadrants and sectors to move. If you want to move within a quadrant, set 
the left number to zero so you don't warp out of that quadrant. Warp uses stardates, energy and a 
turn. If you warp into a quadrant that has only you and stars, the screen will be green. If you warp 
into a quadrant with aliens or aliens and a starbase, the screen will be red. If you warp into a 
quadrant with just the starbase, the screen will be gray. You cannot warp through stars. If you try, 
you lose the stardate and energy but don't go anywhere. 
 
Photon Torpedo=If you hit an enemy with one of these, just one shot kills them. You select the 
direction with the same numbers as warp. there must be a clear line of sight between you and the 
enemy

Strat O Gems Deluxe is a falling jewels game similar to Columns, Acid Drop, Jewel Master, Paris

Three colored gems fall from the top of the screen in a vertical pattern. You must place the gems on 
the growing pile so that there are three or more of the same color in a row horizontally, vertically 
or diagonally. When you get three or more of the same color in a row, they will disappear from the 
screen. If you get a combo of three or more levels, you get a high bonus. A combo is when gems 
disappear and cause more gems to line up and disappear. Occasionally, three gems that change colors 
and have colored horizontal bars across them will appear. These will create a row with whatever gems 
you place them on. At the end of the level, a flashing white gem with a horizontal white bar will 
drop down. This will remove whatever color gem it is placed on, regardless of where they are on the 
screen. If the gems pile up to the line at the top of the screen, the game is over.

You are sent to check out an abandoned asteroid base called Stronghold. As you approach, drones are 
launched from the surface. It may be abandoned but apparently the automatic defense system still 
works. 
 
You must shoot or avoid the drones. If the drones are cloned, and traveling in sets, shooting any 
drone in the set destroys all the ones in the set, if they are destroyable (see Game variations). You 
can move in any direction but cannot shoot straight left or right. You can shoot in any other 
direction, however. After you get past the drones, three shields form near the bottom of the screen. 
Also, interceptor and patrol ships appear. The interceptors track you and the patrol ships just move 
back and forth over the shields. 
 
You must shoot through the shields while dodging these ships so you can shoot the command crawler on 
the asteroid's surface. Be warned, though, that once there is a hole in the shield, the command 
crawler will shoot through it to destroy you. The crawler tries to stay below you but it is slow. In 
some game variations, the Mega-Field starts to form at the top of the screen, reducing your 
maneuvering room(see Game variations).

The difficulty switches determine what level you will start on. 
Both are set to B=start at level 1

sink as many as you can.  The periscope can turn 360 degrees and look off into the horizon or close

Super Breakout (1978) (Atari) (c) 1981 Atari, Inc. / Atari, Inc. 
 
Super Breakout features similar gameplay to the original, but with several new game variations. Your 
goal is to earn as many points as possible by destroying the bricks at the top of the playfield. To 
do this, you need to use the paddle at the bottom of the screen to keep a bouncing ball within the 
playfield. There are four different game variations included. The first is 'Breakout', and plays the 
same as the original game. 
 
This leaves three new gameplay concepts. In 'Progressive' the brick walls will slowly drop towards 
the bottom of the screen and the ball moves progressively faster and faster. When there's room, a new 
layer of bricks will appear at the top. 
 
The other two games add a second paddle. In 'Double Breakout' you have two balls to keep in play and 
score with. In 'Cavity' there is a single ball in play when you start, but two additional balls 
trapped within the bricks. These are freed when their surrounding bricks are destroyed.

Surfer's Paradise - But Danger Below! (1983) (Video Gems) (c) 1983 
 
In Surfer's Paradise, the player's objective is to stay on top of a wave as long as possible. From 
time to time, a shark will approach the player who can in turn jump to try to avoid the shark. If 
they fail or if they don't manage to stay on top of the wave, they will drop into the water. 
 
The underwater sequence makes up the second part of the game. Here, the player has to get from the 
left side of the screen to the right side and back onto their surf board. However, there's a sunken 
galleon in their way. The player has to navigate a maze of walls in a limited amount of time while 
also avoiding oncoming jellyfish. 
 
Once the player reaches the top of the board, a new and more difficult round starts. Scoring is 
achieved by staying on top of the wave as long as possible. Extra lives are awarded for every 1000 
points.

This game is in three sections. They are called Shipwrecked, The Wilderness Island and The Secret 
Temple. 
 
Shipwrecked: You begin on a raft in the water. You must make your way to the island at the top while 
avoiding sharks and other sea creatures. Along the way, you must collect food and water so you can 
survive the island. If a shark or other sea creature hits you, you will lose the raft and all 
supplies. If you are hit when not on a raft, you will lose your life. You can press fire to swim 
faster but this will cost you life points, which can get you killed. 
 
The Wilderness Island: You make your way on the island while avoiding snakes, traps and other 
dangers. You must look for the temple, the key to the temple door and any other items you will need 
to get through the temple. Watch your food meter that it doesn't run out. Use the menu to eat 
food/drink water as needed. You can also switch to search mode, which allows you to place your 
walking stick on an item to learn what it is without getting hurt. 
 
The Secret Temple: You make your way through the temple in first person perspective, trying to learn 
its secret. Sometimes you will need to find certain items to pass through magical barriers. Watch out

In this game you have entered some underground caverns on another planet. As you try to navigate your 
way through, you must destroy enemy space ships and force fields. You move the target reticle by 
moving the joystick and fire weapons by pressing the red button. You can see the ships coming in the 
distance but if they get too close they will fire on you, causing you to lose energy. If you see a 
force field, you will see a square to the right. Shoot the square to disable the field. If your ship 
hits the field, you lose energy. You gain energy when you destroy a ship or disable a force field. 
Use the map on the top of your screen to determine which path to take, left or right. If you choose 
the wrong path or run out of energy, the game is over.

Swedish Erotica: Bachelor Party (c) 1983 Mystique / Mystique 
 
An Adult Video Game was unheard of in the early days of console game. Regardless, Bachelor Party was 
one of those very few games that was regarded at that time as an Adult Video Game (or at least 
claimed to be one). 
 
Bachelor Party is a simple straight-forward pong game but with a wild twist: the objective of the 
game is help ol'bachelor (read=ball) here get lucky with the ladies by "hitting" him with a dose 
Spanish Fly (read=paddle, and that's a lot of doses!), hopefully with your help, he'll "score" 
frequently. When each lady is "hit", the lady disappears until all 8-16 ladies are "subdued" and on 
to the next level. Looks like someone's gonna be busy tonight. 
 
The bachelor has 4 lives to start and in order to survive (the night) he has to keep getting a 
regular dose of Spanish Fly (since without it...you know...) to keep the ladies (and him) happy. 
 
The game consists of 2 player modes and 4 level modes: Games number 1 and 3 are one-player versions 
and 2 and 4 are two-player versions. In games 1 and 2 there are two rows of 4 women in each row. 
Games 3 and 4 are more difficult in that there are two rows of 8 women in each row, and they slowly 
advance during play (looks like the Spanish Fly is working!) 
 
One last funny thing is that the bachelor appears to have three arms...*ahem*

Beat 'Em and Eat 'Em (c) 1982 Mystique / Mystique 
 
This adult game is reminiscent of Activision's Kaboom!. 
 
As a man at the top of the building masturbates and ejaculates, you, as the player, must catch all 
the drops in your mouth(s) (see Game variations). You start with four lives and lose one if you miss 
a drop, which will then hit the ground. 
 
Game variations 
Game 1 has two women to catch with 
Game 2 has only one woman to catch with. 
 
Difficulty switches 
Only the left switch is used. 
Set to A and a catch counts if you touch a drop as far down as your waist. Set to B and a catch only 
counts as far down as shoulder height. 
 
Scoring 
You get one point for each drop caught. 
You get an extra life every 69 points.

a rowdy and naked General Custer must make his way through a hail of continual arrows to a Native 
American Princess tied to a pole.  If Custer can survive the obstacles in his way, he then gets an 
opportunity to have "sexual intercourse" for big points.  Whether his needs have been sated, or 
brought down by enemy fire, Custer will return again and again to get what he wants.  One of the few 
"adult oriented" titles for the Atari 2600.

Sword of Saros (1983) (Starpath) (c) 1983 Starpath Corporation / Starpath Corporation 
 
You have entered a wizard's dungeons in search of the fabled Sword of Saros. You must avoid the 
wizard, his hunter bat and other nasties while gathering treasure. Then you must escape from the 
dungeons. 
 
You begin in the maze. The narrow areas are corridors and the wider areas are rooms. You must move 
from room to room, avoiding the wizard and his bat, gathering treasure, items and keys. Once in a 
room, do not stand around as each room has a monster in it that will harm you. Some rooms have doors 
that have either gold or a part of the sword behind them. When you find the sword piece, it will 
transport you to the next level of the dungeon. 
 
In the first two levels, you will be able to see the entire maze. On the next two levels, you will 
reveal parts of the mazes as you explore them. On all later levels, you will only see directly around 
you. If a monster touches you, you will lose life points. If you encounter the wizard, you will lose 
life points and will need to get through his skeletons. You will start at the bottom of the screen 
and need to make your way to the top. In the final dungeon, all the rooms have only unlocked doors 
but you will need gold to bribe the monsters so you can search the doors for the exit. 
 
The items in the maze, and their uses, are: 
 
1. Gold: Not a selectable item. Needed to bribe monsters in the last level 
2. Gems: If you collect nine gems, you can use them to get one or more type of each other item 
3. Lamp: Makes it possible to see the entire maze. Not needed for mazes one or two. 
4. Potion: Restores four to seven life points. You can never have more than twenty-five total life 
   points. 
5. Cross:  Makes the wizard and bat move as far from you as the can 
6. Scroll: Allows you to see the wizard and bat, even if they are not in a visible portion of the 
   maze. Not needed for mazes one and two. 
7. Ring: Makes you invisible to the wizard, bat and room monsters 
8. Keys: Not a selectable item. Needed to open locked doors except on last dungeon. Keys do not 
   leave the dungeon level where they are found. When you get the sword piece, any extra keys you are 
   carrying are lost and you must find new keys.

SwordQuest: EarthWorld was an adventure game produced for the Atari 2600. The game play boils down to

more items, and seeing the odd set of numbers flash at you if you get the right combination of items 
in the right rooms. 
 
The sets of numbers, for instance 16-4, were actually a combination of a page number and a panel 
number in the comic book that came with the game. On the page indicated by the game, you would find a 
word hidden somewhere in the numbered panel. When all the correct words were found, you could send

You are Slinky the tapeworm. You must move about the bean patch, eating beans. Each time you eat a 
bean, you grow longer and the bean count goes down by one. 
 
Beans appear randomly in the patch and you must eat them before the beetle at the bottom get from 
left to right to get the count down to zero. If the beetle gets to the right before you get the bean, 
two more beans will appear in the patch and two more beans are added to the count. 
 
At times, Beeky the bird or Spanky the spider will pass through the bean patch. In later levels, an 
obstacle will appear in the middle of the patch. 
 
You lose a life if you touch your head (yellow square) to the obstacle or the sides of the patch, 
touch your head to your body, or Spanky or Beeky touch your head (eat you). 
 
The third patch is night. When you get a bean, you can see the patch for two seconds. If you need 
more looks, you can press the fire button for another two seconds of light but it costs you a bean.

Black=Eggie, the IRS agent. If he catches you, he will audit you. In these audits, you always lose. 
You are then taxed at 50% of your income and sent back to the income screen.There are no appeals to 
tax court. 
Pink=Waggie, the CPA. If he catches you (or you go to him), he will charge you $1,000.00 but whatever 
tax sheltered investment you have, he will put you in a better one. 
Green=Toodles, the registered investment adviser. If you two meet, he will put you in the best tax 
sheltered investment available, thus making you the most profit. 
 
After each season, you are taxed to an amount determined by your tax shelter. The object is to have 
$1,000,000.00 at the end of the year after taxes.

rev up your saw and make cold-cuts out of them. 
 
Try to avoid obstacles like hedges, fences, cow skulls and wheelchairs.

fuel, the game is over. 
 
If you run into fences, cow skulls or wheelchairs, you will be delayed a moment. If you run into 
hedge, you will need to use the chainsaw to remove them. The chainsaw idles all the time so you don't 
want to be delayed. 
 
You get 1000 points for each tourist killed. You get a new fuel tank every 5000 points. When you run 
out of fuel, a tourists comes up behind you and kicks you in the pants.

The action is viewed from the side, with the graphics drawn in vectors, in keeping with the 
mathematical nature of everything that unfolds. 
 
As a Resistance fighter, the player must fly into enemy lines in order to steal Klystron Pods to 
power more advanced starships, using your tractor beam to take them. A network of mounted guns are 
aiming to shoot the player down – these can be disabled by shooting their power source, but 
eventually this will explode, forcing the player to flee. Some of the later levels feature reverse

kick, punch, and perform several moves such as the airplane spin, body slam, power lift, and more. 
Using the available moves you need to deplete your opponents energy  and pin him for three counts 
(though be careful, as some of the more powerful moves also use up a bit of your own energy). If your 
opponents energy is low enough and you successfully pin him that will count as a fall, and the best 
out of three falls will win the match!

would be like.  Because “Tunnel Runner” was designed with a built-in expanded memory chip (RAM 
Plus!), it's 12KB of memory gives it the ability to present the maze in three dimensions.  Therefore, 
the playfield is a colorful, three-dimensional maze, so you never see yourself... just the walls on 
either side of you that form the corridors you travel along.  As you move along the passage-ways, 
additional tunnels appear on either side, which you can turn into by pressing left and right. 
 
Your primary goal is to locate and collect the hidden key, located in a different spot within each 
maze.  Through the assistance of a MAP, you can maneuver within the maze.  While attempting to locate 
the key to exit the level, you must also avoid the hungry Zot’s.  You will discover these enemy 
creatures throughout the maze.  Successfully recovering the key without being intercepted by the 
Zot's opens the portal to the next level.  As you pass each level, you will discover that the 
complexity and difficulty increases, while your MAP gradually reveals less and less information… 
ultimately, your map will be of little use, requiring you to survive solely by instincts and quick 
thinking!

Turmoil (1982) (20th Century Fox) (c) 1982 Sirius Software, Inc. / Fox Video Games, Inc. 
 
Turmoil is a fast-paced shooter. You pilot a ship that is trapped within a chamber of seven tunnels.  
Your ship can only move up and down along a vertical corridor connecting the tunnels.  You are not 
alone, however.  A variety of enemies travel along these tunnels, focused on destroying you.  
Therefore, the ultimate objective of “Turmoil” is to zoom up and down the center alley and blast 
aliens as they streak by.  Keep shooting and keep moving, and you will survive to live another day!  
As you move quickly up and down, you must also fire your own weapons into to the left or right side.  
Part of the intensity of this game is driven by the fact that you can't stay in one place for too 
long.  If you do, an indestructible enemy will come flying at you, forcing to move onward once more. 
 
The enemy ships you will encounter in each of the seven tunnels travel at a variety of unique speeds. 
 The faster a given enemy moves, the more points you will receive if you shoot them.  Occasionally 
when you destroy one of the enemy ships, a flashing orb will appear at the far end of the tunnel.  
This is the one exception where you are not restricted to your vertical pathway.  In these situations 
you are allowed to move down the tunnel to recover it.  If you grab it quickly, it is worth bonus 
points.  If you hesitate, it hatches into a fast moving missile and will destroy you if you get in 
its way. 
 
When you start a game of Turmoil, you are given five ships.  If you can blast all of the aliens in a 
level, you'll receive a bonus ship.  In addition to your current ship, you can hold as many as six 
reserve ships at one time.  You will loose a ship if you make contact with any of the passing aliens. 
 There are nine levels to the game, each with multiple waves to complete, and each one faster and 
more challenging then the previous level.  This is considered by many to be one of 20th Century Fox's 
best games.

can also collect things like balloons and ice cream cones for bonus points. The faster you collect 
all the flags, the bigger a time bonus you get. 
 
In later levels, there are dead-ends or gaps and a vehicle that is carrying a flag you need, so you 
will need to jump on him. If you are hit by another vehicle or go off the course, you lose a life. In 
two player games, play alternates.

Vanguard (1982) (Atari) (c) 1982 SNK Corporation / Atari, Inc. 
 
Vanguard is an arcade style shooter for one or two players. Your goal is to pilot your spaceship to 
the City of Mystery which is located at the end of a heavily guarded tunnel, and once there destroy 
the creature Gond. The tunnel is broken up into several different zones, called the mountain zone, 
rainbow zone, stick zone, stripe zone, bleak zone, and City of Mystery. Each zone features different 
types of enemy spaceships to deal with, and can scroll either horizontally or vertically. In the 
mountain zone or stripe zone, you may also come across an energy pod marked with an 'E'. If you fly 
through this, your ship temporarily becomes invincible to the deadly cave walls and numerous enemies 
which are trying to stop you. When not invincible, your space ship is equipped with lasers to help 
destroy enemies. You can fire in four different directions, however your speed is decreased when 
firing. You also need to keep an eye on your fuel gauge

Video Chess (1978) (Atari) (c) 1979 Atari, Inc. / Atari, Inc. 
 
This is an early home chess game. The standard U. S. chess rules are used in this game. To move a 
piece, place the X on the board onto the piece to be moved then press the red button. Next, move the 
X to where you want the piece to go and press the button again. If the move is illegal, the 2600 will 
give a warning sound and not make the move. 
 
To castle your king, the king and rook must not have been moved. You move your king two squares in 
the direction of the rook to castle with. The 2600 will then automatically move your rook around your 
king, completing the move. You cannot castle out of check and you cannot castle to the king's side if 
any squares between the king and rook are threatened. 
 
Another maneuver is called en passant. This move is used to counteract the enemy pawn's initial 
double move on a adjacent square.  To carry out the en passant, you must advance your 
pawn to the fifth rank.  Your opponent then has the option of moving 
his or her pawn one square (where it would be under attack) or two 
squares.  If you opponent elects to move two squares, the en passant move allows you to take that 
pawn by diagonally moving your pawn to the square that was skipped over. 
 
Skill levels 
These determine how long the computer will think on its move. These times are approximate and may 
vary slightly, depending on what move you did. 
Level 1=15 seconds 
Level 2=30 seconds 
Level 3=45 seconds 
Level 4=2 minutes, 45 seconds 
Level 5=3 minutes, 15 seconds 
Level 6=12 minutes 
Level 7=10 hours 
Level 8=10 seconds 
 
Level 8 is a beginner level.

Video Olympics is an action game containing numerous variations of the game Pong. Two players (or one 
player against the computer) control paddles on the screen and attempt to prevent a bouncing ball 
from getting past them. In the most basic game variations, each player has a single paddle and there 
are no obstacles on the screen. The other game variations add paddles and obstacles, and some are 
loosely inspired by various sports and change the playfield around, but the goal remains the same: 
hit the ball past your opponents paddle into the goal to earn points. A few of these variations are: 
 
1. Foozpong: Each player controls multiple paddles which are arranged somewhat like a foozball 
   table. 
 
2. Soccer pong: Each player controls two paddles (representing one goalie and one player) and the 
   goal is much narrower. 
 
3. Hockey pong: The playfield is set up to resemble hockey

Wizard of Wor is an arcade shooter played from a top-down point of view. 
 
The player controls a warrior who is trapped in a dungeon. The goal is to earn as many points as 
possible by shooting the numerous enemy creatures which wander about the maze like corridors. The 
creatures wander about at various speeds, may shoot darts at the player, and some even have the 
ability to disappear temporarily. At the bottom of the screen the player has a radar which can be 
used to locate creatures that are invisible. 
 
When the the player completes a maze, a Worluk sometimes appears. This creature moves rapidly and 
will only be on the screen momentarily. If the player destroys the creature before it escapes, the 
next dungeon will become a double score dungeon and all creatures will be worth twice as many points. 
Occasionally the Wizard of Wor himself may appear! He moves quickly and can teleport around the maze. 
If they destroy him, the player will earn a large amount of points. 
 
The game may be played by one player or two players simultaneously.

You command a tank at the bottom of the screen. You can move left or right but you are always moving 
forward. You can control the forward speed by pushing up or down on the joystick. 
 
As worms move back and forth you must shoot them so they don't touch your tank. Also shoot any blocks 
in you path. Try not to shoot fuel pagodas. Touch them to refuel. You can go to the far left or right 
of the screen and not get touched by a worm but you can't shoot them when you are there either. 
 
In the two player games, you have selections on co-operative or competitive. In co-op, you have the 
same points and fuel tank. When one tank refuels, it refuels both. In competitive, you each have a 
score and fuel tank. You compete to get enemies and fuel.

Xenos.  The very name strikes fear into every colonist's heart.  A distress call is received from 
space stations orbiting your homeworld, then silence.  A single ship escapes, piloted by a battered 
man who tells the tale of pods that hatch into acid-spitting Xenos. 
 
A small band of engineers has been dispatched to combat the Xeno threat before it takes over all the 
space stations and, eventually, your homeworld.  Assemble your band of engineers and fight the Xenos 
on each station, striving to either clear it or abandon it.  You start out with a standard issue 
laser, but can pick up additiona weapons as you find them, including Phasers, Lightning Rifles, 
Poofer guns, and bombs. 
 
Xenophobe was originally an arcade coin-op by Bally/Midway, released in 1987.  Gameplay premise and 
setting is heavily inspired/influenced by the movie Aliens.

Yars' Revenge (1981) (Atari) (c) 1981 Atari, Inc. / Atari, Inc. 
 
In Yars' Revenge, your goal is to destroy the Qotile laser-base which is located on the right side of 
the screen behind a shield. You control the fly-like Yar, which can destroy the shield piece by piece 
by either shooting it or running into it. Once the shield is down, you will need to use the Zorlon 
cannon to destroy the Qotile. The Zorlon cannon is located on the left side of the screen, and when 
fired can destroy the Qotile with a direct hit. The Qotile isn't completely unarmed against your 
attacks, however. Wandering around the screen is a destroyer missile, which will constantly be homing 
in on your Yar. This missile can not be destroyed, however you can temporarily hide from it in a 
shield which runs vertically in the center of the screen. The Yar will be unable to fire when hiding 
in the shield so you can't stay there indefinitely! The Qotiles second weapon is a swirl which it 
will randomly fire at you and should be dodged. When you finally destroy the Qotile you can move on 
to the next, faster round of gameplay. Several game variations are included which control the 
difficulty and speed of the game.

The Zaxxon defence system must be destroyed in this isometric-viewed shoot 'em up which was 
originally hugely successful in the arcades. The game has 3 stages, first taking you through Asteroid 
City, which is heavily protected by aircraft, guns and missiles. Many barriers are alarmed, leaving 
you with limited space to progress through, and fire must constantly be dodged. 
 
Stage two is a space shoot out against hordes of enemy aircraft - those you failed to destroy in the 
first part of the task. Complete this and you reach the final battle with Zaxxon, with the game 
looping with increased difficulty if you can survive the first time. There are 3 distinct skill 
levels, while controls involve using forward to dive and back to climb, in the manner of flight 
simulation.

the missiles turn into balloon bombs that you mustn't run into and later levels, the balloon bombs 
turn into horizontally travelling missiles if you are level with the balloon. 
 
There are four game variations. Games one and two are one or two player, respectively, at a beginner 
level. Games three and four are one or two player, respectively, at advanced level. 
 
You advance to the next level when all the cities of that level are destroyed. The game ends if you

being shot down by flak cannons (which can cause a drop by up to 15 altitude) and to land safely 
again before the fuel runs out. If more than ten enemies have been shot it is possible to take off 
again with an ammo equal to the number of enemies being hit.

Im Reich der Spinne (c) 1987 Froggo Games Corporation / Froggo Games Corporation 
 
It's the future, when droids do battle.  You send your Spiderdroid in to capture a building by 
covering the structure with its unbreakable Droidweb. Your Spiderdroid lays down a web strand as it 
crawls along each girder. Once you have strung a web strand completely around an opening, the 
Spiderdroid flings a web over that opening.  Your objective is to travel all the building's girders 
so the entire structure is caught in your Droidweb. 
 
But watch out!  The building is swarming with Birddroids out to have your Spiderdroid for lunch.  If 
you get cornered, use your secret weapon! Press the Joystick's button to cast a magic spell that 
makes the Birddroids invisible and unable to eat you... but only for a few seconds.  And remember - 
each of your Spiderdroids can cast only four magic spells. Once you capture the first building, it's 
time to send your advanced Mummydroid to capture the next one, which is guarded by a horde of 
Skeledroids!

In this game, you control Marvin the Cube Master. You move him around a six-sided cube with nine 
squares to a side. 
The object is to get all nine sides to be one color each in the least amount of time or fewest moves, 
depending on the game variation you select. 
 
Marvin changes a space's color by standing on it and you pressing the fire button. Marvin will then 
exchange the color he is with the space. Marvin cannot move onto a space of the same color as he is. 
 
To rotate the cube, just move to the edge and press the joystick in the direction to rotate. 
 
The game variations allow for normal or fast speed or timed race or fewest moves. 
Other variations cause the cube to show all the spaces as black except when it rotates, so you don't 
know what color your on. 
Two of the game variations, one a timed race and the other a fewest moves challenge, restrict you 
rotations to up and right only, but do not black out the spaces. 
 
Eight of the game variations have the computer play the game itself.

Skull Island (c) 1983 Fox Video Games, Inc. / Fox Video Games, Inc. 
 
You are a bank robber, driving around a maze of streets (representing the city) in a 1930's style 
car.  Your purpose is clear: perform "bank heists" by driving across white-pillared symbols that 
represent banks.  As you "rob" each of the banks, they disappear, and a police car appears in its 
place, beginning hot pursuit after a few moments.  You must avoid the cops to stay alive.  
Fortunately you are not completely defenseless, as you have a stock of dynamite, which you can 
strategically drop to destroy the cop cars. 
 
Besides the escape tunnel that will take you from one side of the screen to another (as in Pac-Man), 
there is an additional tunnel that represents the road out of town.  By taking it, you will find 
yourself in the next city.  Each city is increasingly difficult, and the cop cars are faster and 
smarter. 
 
There are 9 banks in each town, and you receive an increase in gasoline each time you rob one.  
Therefore, the goal of the game is to drive from town to town, navigating the mazes of streets, and 
robbing as many of the banks in each town as you are able to.  This keeps your gas supply high, and 
the money rolling in!  If you run out of gas, the game is over.

Fun With Numbers (c) 1977 Atari, Inc. / Sears, Roebuck and Co. 
 
A very simple math game for kids. 
 
Each game of Basic Math gives the player a set of ten basic math problems (i.e. simple addition, 
subtraction, multiplication or division) to solve. The player is presented with two numbers and a 
function, and inputs the answer by cycling through numbers with the joystick. A timer option is 
available to ramp up the difficulty.  The game has eight primary game settings - basically two 
settings for each mathematical function.  Games 1 - 4 allow you to select one of the numbers you will 
be working with, while 5 - 8 give random questions. 
 
Hint: For division problems that have a remainder make sure to put a space between the whole number 
and the remainder, which goes to the right.

Battlezone TC by Thomas Jentzsch (c) 1983 Atari, Inc. / Atari, Inc. 
 
Atari Games' 3D tank game was ground-breaking when released to the arcades, and as such was converted 
officially to many systems. Earth has been invaded, and you and your tank lead the defensive effort. 
You drive around the battlefield from a first-person view, targeting and firing at tanks, planes and 
UFOs. You have a radar to help you see where the enemies are in direction and distance. Objects can 
be used as strategic cover. Controls simulate the tracks of a tank realistically, so the direction 
and speed settings are varied - combining forward right and backward left movements (as you can on 
keyboard versions) sees you change direction more quickly.

Boing! 2004 (c) 1983 First Star Software, Inc. / First Star Software, Inc. 
 
This is a game rather reminiscent of Q*bert. 
 
In this game, you are a bubble named, with great originality, Bubble. 
The object here is to bounce on each of the thirty-six squares and turn them all on. You start at the 
bottom left. On the bottom right starts the Bubble Eater. He will chase you around the play field and 
if he catches you, you lose one of your five lives. Pin starts at the top of a row and moves down. If 
you are hit by Pin, you pop and a life is lost. 
 
The good thing about Pin, other than that it doesn't actively chase you, is that if it lands on the 
Bubble Eater, it will pop it, too. When the Bubble Eater is popped, it turns into a glowing puddle 
for a short time. While it is a puddle, you can bounce on it without getting hurt. 
 
Game variations 
The game select switch just lets you start on levels one, two or three. 
 
Levels 
There are 5 waves per level. 
Level 1: The Bubble can bounce on any square and it will turn on and stay on. 
Level 2: The same as level 1 but all the squares of a horizontal row must be turned on before you go 
to another row. 
Level 3: The same as level 1 but you must turn on horizontal rows 2, 4 and 6 before you turn on rows 
1, 3 or 5. 
Level 4: The Bubble can bounce on any square and turn it on, but if you bounce on it again it turns 
off then you must bounce on it once more to turn it on again. 
Level 5: The same as level 4 but all the squares of a horizontal row must be turned on before you go 
to another row. 
Level 6: The same as level 4 but you must turn on horizontal rows 2, 4 and 6 before you turn on rows 
1, 3 or 5. 
 
Scoring 
You get 300 points the first time a Bubble Eater is popped in a wave. 
You score points each time you turn on a step. In levels 4 to 6, you get points even if you are 
turning on a step a repeatedly. 
You get points for completing a level and/or wave. The amount varies by what level or wave you 
completed.

need to dive back into his rabbit hole to avoid getting a cotton-tail full of buckshot. 
 
You have three levels on the screen. You must select a level then press your button to steal the 
carrot. Once the carrot is stolen, Elmer's hound will dig where the carrot was, forcing you to come 
above ground. You must then make your way to the hole the hound dug and dive in to safety before 
Elmer blasts you. Once you have cleared all three levels, it is on to the next screen. If Elmer 
shoots you three times, the game is over. In a two player game, one player is Bugs, the other is

You must catch pastries from six conveyor belts before they fall on the floor. Each pastry caught is 
boxed and put behind you. Sometimes, a knife and fork come down the conveyor belt. If you are hit by 
the utensils or miss a pastry, the janitor has to clean it up. If he has to clean up too many times, 
he gets upset and storms out and game over. 
 
You can push the button to stop a conveyor belt for about four seconds but if you stop a second one, 
the first belt starts right back up. On games with belt speed up, you can push right on the joystick 
to speed up the belt you are in front of. 
 
At the end of each level, you will have a cup of coffee come down the belt, but not fall off the end. 
When you grab the cup, you get and extra clean-up (life) and the next level begins. 
 
Difficulty switches 
Set the left switch to A to start at level five. Set to B to start at level one. The right switch is 
not used. 
 
The are game variations that force the baker to pause when transferring boxes, making it harder, 
variations that allow belt speedup, variations with fast moving bakers and variations with all

You are at the carnival, and are going to take a chance at the shooting gallery! Your goal is to earn 
as many points as possible by shooting the various targets before you run out of bullets. In addition 
to the assorted targets that float by, there are boxes which can be shot to earn additional bullets. 
You also need to be careful of the ducks! From time to time, a duck will fly down and eat some of 
your bullets if you don't shoot it first. You move on to the next round of gameplay when the rack has 
been cleared of all the targets, and the game ends when you use up all of your bullets.

Centipede 2k (c) 1982 Atari, Inc. / Atari, Inc. 
 
In Centipede, the player is trapped in the Enchanted Forest. Armed with only a magic wand to ward off 
the forest's insect denizens, all of which apparently are attacking in the player in continuous 
waves. 
 
The player must use the magic wand to shoot sparks at approaching insects to score points by pressing 
the controller button. Holding down the controller button will set the wand to rapid fire shots. If 
the player is bitten by an insect, the player will be temporarily paralyzed and lose one of the three 
starting magic wands. 
 
Insect Opponents and Mushrooms 
All enemy insects have a distinctive sound before attacking, which may help the player identify which 
insect is attacking. Enemies and objects in the game are as the following: 
 
1. The Centipede 
The Centipede will attack in 12 waves. In the first wave, the Centipede will have a head attached to 
11 body segments. In the second wave, the Centipede will have a head attached to 10 body segments, in 
addition to a detached head. The third wave will have the Centipede with an attached head, 9 body 
segments, plus two detached heads. These body segments will transform into heads and continue to do 
so until Wave 12. In the last wave, the Centipede will have 12 detached heads, independently 
attacking the player. Centipede heads are worth more points than body segments. 
 
Attacks from the Centipede will come from the top of the screen, moving downward. If a spark hits any 
part of the Centipede, that particular body segment will transform into a mushroom, while the body 
segment behind it will become the new Centipede head. When the Centipede is destroyed, it will 
briefly disappear and re-appear from the top of the screen again. 
 
The Spider 
The Spider will attempt to distract the player from attacking the Centipede. It will destroy any 
mushroom it touches. Spiders will score more points if it is hit in closer distances. 
 
The Flea 
The Flea will appear if the player has destroyed most of the existing mushrooms. It will drop down 
creating a new batch of mushrooms where it falls. The Flea will disappear after two hits. After the 
first hit, the Flea will drop down much faster. 
 
The Scorpion 
The Scorpion will appear in the third wave. It moves slowly but will pick up speed, moving faster. 
While doing so, it will poison any mushroom it touches. 
 
Mushrooms 
Mushrooms fill the Enchanted Forest and may act as obstacles or cover for the player, with added 
effects to enemy insects. It takes for shots to complete destroy a mushroom. There are two type of 
mushrooms: Magic Mushrooms and Poisonous mushrooms. Magic mushrooms are the default mushrooms in the 
game and are also the the result of the player destroying an insect or Centipede body segment. 
Poisonous Mushrooms are the result of the Scorpion touching a mushroom. Poisonous Mushrooms will 
prompt the Centipede near it to move straight towards the player through any mushroom. Losing a wand 
will restore any partially damaged mushroom. 
 
Game Difficulty and Variations 
The game offers four difficulty levels: Novice, Standard, Advanced, and Expert. Game Variations are 
as the following: 
 
1. One Player 
Two Player Alternating 
Two players will take turns when the active player is bitten. 
Dual Player Competition 
Two players will appear on the screen at the same time. Scoring is separate. Shots fired from one 
player will paralyze the other player. 
Team Play 
Two players will appear on the screen at the same time. Scoring is combined. Shots fired from one 
player will not paralyze the other player. 
 
Scoring 
The player will win a bonus magic wand for every 12,000 points to a maximum of six wands. The game 
will end when all wands are lost. Scoring are as the following: 
 
Centipede Head - 100 points 
Centipede Body Segment - 10 points 
Spider at close range - 900 points 
Spider at medium range - 600 points 
Flea - 200 points

one of the buildings in the city. After a building is destroyed, the paratroopers will then begin 
tunneling towards your gun in an effort to destroy it. Occasionally an airplane will fly by and drop 
a large bomb. The bomb needs to be shot before it lands, or it can destroy the entire city! The game 
ends when your gun is destroyed by a bomb or a paratrooper.

Crazy Climber Arcade (c) 1982 Nihon Bussan Co., Ltd. / Atari, Inc. 
 
As Crazy Climber, climb your way to the top of a series of buildings, where a helicopter is waiting 
to pick you up and take you to the next building. As Climber scales a building, he is able to climb 
up and sideways but he cannot climb down. 
While climbing a building, windows will open and close simultaneously. If any window closes on either 
of his hands he will lose his grip. However, if a window closes on both of his hands, he will fall to 
his death, resulting in the loss of a life. You have three Climbers in total, but you are awarded an 
extra Climber every 30,000 points. Besides windows, Climber is faced with other dangers, including: 
 
1. Bald-headed guys who hurl various objects at you. 
2. Pesky condors who fly by, dropping eggs and droppings of an unpleasant substance. 
3. Falling steel girders and iron dumbells. 
4. Electrical "Nichibutsu" signs with a dangling live wire. 
5. Falling "Crazy Climber" signs. 
6. King Kong leaping from side to side of the building and slams his hands against the windows. 
 
The climber must try to avoid or overcome each of those hazards which he will encounter as he 
continues climbing in his attempt to reach the rooftop. If he falls to his death by windows or 
objects,  another climber will replace him and will start at the same location where the last one 
fell. The specific danger will not be present at the same point, so the climber can go further up to 
face the next danger. Most of the hazards are announced by certain recognizable musical themes. 
 
Crazy Climber is awarded a bonus score on each building every time after getting carried off by the 
helicopter. However, each bonus score will decrease by every ten seconds that the climber will spend 
scaling each building as he attempts reach the top. Somewhere in the game, there is "The Lucky 
Balloon", which can lift Climber about ten stories and raise the player's bonus score if he catches 
it.

Donkey Kong Take 2 by Feralstorm (c) 1982 Nintendo Co., Ltd. / Coleco 
 
Released in the arcades in 1981, Donkey Kong was not only Nintendo's first real smash hit for the 
company, but marked the introduction for two of their most popular mascots: Mario (originally 
"Jumpman") and Donkey Kong. 
 
Donkey Kong is a platform-action game that has Mario scale four different industrial themed levels 
(construction zone, cement factory, an elevator-themed level, and removing rivets from girders) in an 
attempt to save the damsel in distress, Pauline, from the big ape before the timer runs out.  Once 
the rivets are removed from the final level, Donkey Kong falls, and the two lovers are reunited.  
From there, the levels start over at a higher difficulty. 
 
Along the way, Mario must dodge a constant stream of barrels, "living" fireballs, and spring-weights. 
 Although not as powerful as in other future games, Mario can find a hammer which allows him to 
destroy the barrels and fireballs for a limited amount of time.  Additionally, Mario can also find 
Pauline's hat, purse and umbrella for additional bonus points. 
 
Donkey Kong is also notable for being one of the first complete narratives in video game form, told 
through simplistic cut scenes that advance the story.  It should also be noted that in versions of 
the game for early 1980's consoles, Donkey Kong only used 2-3 of the original levels, with the cement 
factory usually omitted.

Labyrinth (c) 1982 Starpath Corporation / Starpath Corporation 
 
You've been abducted! Kidnapped! Shanghaied! You find yourself in a huge maze being watched by the 
Mindmaster. He is testing your intelligence, reflexes, agility, etc. The honor of you and the entire 
human race depends on how fast you can solve the Mindmaster's puzzles and six mazes. 
 
You begin in maze one. You must go through the maze and find colored, shaped pegs then find the 
correct shaped hole to put it in. As if that wasn't bad enough, there is an Alien Stalker wandering 
the maze and if he touches you, you lose one chance. You can tell how close he is by the beeping 
sound. The faster and higher it is, the closer he is. He cannot pass through walls or doors. Also, 
starting with maze two, there are force fields in the maze that if you touch them, you lose one 
chance. There are also one-way doors starting with maze four. If you go through one and turn around, 
there is no way back. You can never go through a door when backing up. 
 
There are also skill tests in mazes one through five that you can complete for points. They are as 
follows: 
Maze 1: Agility - Move your cursor from side to side to avoid the falling bricks. The four collisions 
and the test is done. 
Maze 2: Reflexes - Press your joystick in the direction of the arrow 
Maze 3: Recall - Watch the sequence of flashing arrows then move your joystick in the same sequence 
Maze 4: Dexterity - The same as the agility test except the test is over if you get hit once 
Maze 5: Coordination - Land a lander onto a platform without using much fuel. You get up to five 
attempts. 
 
You start each maze with sixty points and every few seconds a point is deducted. The total score for 
each maze is the score you got on the skill test plus whatever is left of the beginning sixty when 
you exit the maze. If you lose all your chances or finish maze six, you will get your final score and 
the Mindmaster's impression of you and the human race.

Galaxian is a shoot 'em up in which the player is at the bottom of the screen, with an arrangement of 
aliens at the top. The player moves left and right to aim at an alien, then shoots a bullet up the 
screen, and the alien it hits is killed. The aliens are classed as Drones, Emissaries, Hornets and 
Commanders, with those higher up the screen scoring more points when destroyed. At set intervals an 
enemy will move down the screen towards you, escorting a bomber, which is a moment of high danger. 
Clear a wave and another is generated.

S.B.I. (Spectravision Bureau of Investigation) file on Chicago Joe and his gang:

Shifty 
2. Scar Face 
3. Mugsy 
4. Lefty 
5. Nitro Ed 
 
Your orders are to snipe any gang member. DO NOT SHOOT AN INNOCENT! Watch out for Nitro Ed. He likes 
to play with hand grenades. One of those and you're pushing up daisies. Good luck. 
 
You move the joystick to aim at a gangster and push the button to fire. Your ammo is limited so don't 
fire randomly. Occasionally, Nitro Ed, on the roof, will hold up a grenade. You must shoot him to 
disarm him. You get money for each gangster shot. The values for level one are: 
 
1. Mugsy=$20 
2. Scare Face=$30 
3. Lefty=$40 
4. Shifty=$50 
5. Disarming Nitro Ed=$100 
 
These amounts increase for each level by $10.  You also get $10 for each bullet you have left after 
each level. There are six levels. The fourth level is a nighttime level. In this level, you must fire 
one bullet to light up the windows. If you do not fire for a couple seconds, they go dark again. 
If you shoot an innocent, you will lose $1000 or you total amount if you have less than $1000. 
 
If a gangster rises all the way out of a window, after a couple of seconds, he will shoot you and you 
will lose one bullet proof vest (life). After you lose all your vests, the game is over and Nitro Ed 
will laugh at you. If Nitro Ed gets off his hand grenade, no matter how many vests you have, the game 
is over. And Nitro Ed will laugh at you. You start with four vests and can earn another at $5000.

treasures. The treasury entrance is at the top of the screen, and you begin each level at the bottom 
and need to climb your way up. To do so, you will need to find a good location where you can throw a 
rope up to the next platform and climb up (there will be a dot on the platform where you can safely 
throw a rope, two on each floor). Before the treasury can be entered, you need to attach ropes to 
each of the possible locations. To hinder your progress, there are guards wandering each of the 
floors. If you're caught, you'll lose a life! To help out, a magic ball will appear on screen from

You want to steal your dream car. But first you must get those other clunkers out of the way. 
 
This is a shifting-pieces puzzle where you are trying to move the white rectangles out of the way so 
the yellow car has a clear path to the exit. Place the circle cursor onto the end of a white or 
yellow car and if it changes from a pink circle with a minus sign to a blue circle with an arrow, you 
can press the button to move the car. Try to free the yellow car in the fewest moves.

Jr. Pac-Man Speed Throttle by Nukey Shay (c) 1987 Bally Midway Manufacturing Co., Inc. / Atari 
    Corporation 
 
Jr. Pac-Man features gameplay similar to the original Pac-Man, but with a few changes. As Jr., 
    you need to eat all of the dots in a maze without running into the four ghosts that are trying to 
    get you. The maze is now much larger, and no longer fits on a single screen. The maze will scroll 
    around to follow the action. From time to time a tasty bonus will bounce around the screen which 
    can be eaten for extra points. There are tricycles, kites, drums, balloons, trains, root beers, 
    and other bonuses that appear as the levels progress. When the bonus items bounce around the 
    screen, any dots they touch will become larger and are now worth 50 points each instead of 10. 
    However, one of these larger dots will cause Jr. Pac-Man to slow down greatly when he eats them 
    making it more difficult to remain one step ahead of the ghosts which constantly pursue him! 
    Located throughout the maze are power pellets

Canguru (c) 1983 Taito Corporation / Atari, Inc. 
 
Jungle Hunt offers four unique adventure experiences, which repeat with greater difficulty once all 
four have been survived.  If you don't survive these adventures, you will not only lose your own life 
but that of the lovely Penelope, who has been captured by cannibals! 
 
The first part challenges your Tarzan skills - can you swing on the vines without plummeting to your 
doom?  The second part pits you against a whole bunch of nasty crocodiles in a mighty river.  
Fortunately, you have a knife to fight back with.  Don't forget to go up for air!  In the third part, 
you face a battle against oncoming boulders of varying sizes and physics.  Once you've cleared all 
these treacherous hazards, you still must confront the dreaded cannibal, who is armed with a wicked 
spear.  Can you get past him and save the lovely Penelope? 
 
Gameplay involves much strategic jumping and knife play (in the river/crocodile phase).  The view is 
always a side view, much like Pitfall! and later platform games.

You are a member of MegaForce and have been sent to the city of Sardoun. Sardoun is under attack and 
you must defend it. You are armed with the Moto-Fighter, a sort of armed motorcycle with flight 
ability. 
 
When you are on the ground, your missiles fire down and forward, at an angle. When you are in the 
air, your missiles fire straight ahead. 
 
The object is to destroy enemy fighters, destroy or avoid ground-launched rockets, destroy fuel 
depots and destroy the enemy headquarters. Any enemy fighters that get past you will head to Sardoun 
and bomb a building. You will see a red flash at the top of the screen with the words "Defend" when 
Sardoun is in trouble. 
 
Every second you are playing, you use one gallon on fuel. If you run out of fuel, you lose a life. 
You can shoot fuel tanks to replenish. If you destroy all the tanks of that depot, a prize will 
appear that you can shoot (but may not want to). See "Prizes" for details. Each tank destroyed is 
worth eighty points and ten gallons of fuel. 
 
Each enemy fighter destroyed is worth 100 points. 
Each ground rocket destroyed is worth 300 points. 
Each tower of the enemy headquarters destroyed is worth 300 to 600 points. If you get them all, you 
get one more point. 
Each tower of Sardoun destroyed is worth 100 to 400 points and ten gallons of fuel each BUT if all 
the towers are destroyed, you will not be able to get any more points that round and will lose a life 
at the end of that round.

You are trapped in a maze and have a limited amount of time to locate the exit. You can find and use 
dynamite to open additional doors in some mazes. There are sixteen mazes total. The game's 
orientation requires you to turn your TV 90°, lay on your right side, use mirrors so the screen looks 
like it is 90° turned or create a tabletop monitor.

Meteroids (1982) (Starpath) (c) 1982 Arcadia Corporation / Arcadia Corporation 
 
Suicide Mission is an arcade action game similar to Asteroids. You control a microscopic submarine 
navigating the bloodstream of someone who has been infected by a virus. Your goal is to destroy the 
virus! Each time you shoot a cell infected with the virus, it will split up into smaller pieces. 
Eventually the pieces will be small enough that they can be destroyed. When everything has been 
destroyed, you can move on to the next, more difficult level. The game features three levels of 
difficulty, and you can choose one of two shooting styles for your submarine (single torpedoes, or 
rapid fire).

Arcade Golf (c) 1979 Atari, Inc. / Atari, Inc. 
 
This is a computer game simulation of a Miniature Golf course. It attempts to refine your sense of 
timing and your perceptiveness in judging distance.  As in a traditional miniature golf course, a 
variety of obstacles are placed in your path to the "cup."  Depending on the game that is selected, 
the course can be played solo, or a two player competition can be initiated. 
 
Rather than a full 18 holes, this Miniature Golf variation has a nine-hole half-course.  Your goal is 
clear: taking the various obstacles into account, hit the ball through the course and complete each 
hole by knocking the ball into the cup.  The number of attempts you make for a single hole is tallied 
as strokes.  While total strokes are unlimited, each hole still has a specific par assigned to it.  
So ideally, you should make it your goal to not exceed the par assigned to each hole. 
 
Using the standard joystick controller, you can position the club to adjust the strength and angle of 
how the ball is hit. Remember that no matter how many strokes have accrued, it is necessary to get 
the ball in the cup before the game continues on to the next hole.

In Moonsweeper your goal is to rescue miners from the moons in Star Quadrant Jupiter. You begin your 
mission in space where you must avoid deadly aurora flares, photon torches and space bullets from the 
sun in this quadrant. From time to time you will see a moon pass by, and by flying near it you can 
descend to the surface. As you sweep along the surface, you will see stranded miners which need to be 
rescued by flying over them. Also on the moons surface are various obstacles which must be avoided or 
destroyed, such as towers and lunar satellites as well as alien surface destroyers. Should you 
survive and rescue six miners (the maximum your ship can carry), then you may take off from the 
surface by using the accelerator rings. There are several different types of moons found in this 
quadrant, each with a different level of difficulty. To help out, your ship is equipped with photon 
torpedoes and shields (though you will lose points while using the shield).

Motocross Racer is a bike racing game where you need to race through three different scenes in the

perspective. First you will race through the desert with a 3-D behind the bike point of view. Rocks, 
cacti, scorpions, and other obstacles should be avoided or you'll crash and lose valuable time. Next 
you'll race a winding path uphill through the woods. This section has a top down view, and you'll 
lose time if you wander off the track or crash into obstacles. The final segment of the race takes 
place on the beach with a side scrolling point of view. Various obstacles and other racers will all 
get in your way here! If you crash too many times, or take too long the game will be over.

Miss Pack Man (c) 1982 General Computer Corporation|Midway / Atari, Inc. 
 
In 1982, a sequel to the  incredibly popular Pac-Man was introduced in the form of his girlfriend, 
Ms. Pac-Man.  This sequel continued on the "eat the dots/avoid the ghosts" gameplay of the original 
game, but added new features to keep the title fresh. 
 
Like her boyfriend, Ms. Pac-Man attempts to clear four various and challenging mazes filled with dots 
and ever-moving bouncing fruit  while avoiding Inky, Blinky, Pinky and Sue, each with their own 
personalities and tactics.  One touch from any of these ghosts means a loss of life for Ms. Pac-Man. 
 
Ms. Pac-Man can turn the tables on her pursuers by eating one of the four Energizers located 
    within the maze. During this time, the ghosts turn blue, and Ms. Pac-Man can eat them for bonus 
    points (ranging from 200, 400, 800 and 1600, progressively). The Energizer power only lasts for a 
    limited amount of time, as the ghost's eyes float back to their center box, and regenerate to 
    chase after Ms. Pac-Man again. 
 
Survive a few rounds of gameplay, and the player will be treated to humorous intermissions showing 
the growing romantic relationship between Pac-Man and Ms. Pac-Man, leading all the way up to the 
arrival of "Junior".

Now it's time for...PIIIIIIGS IN SPAAAAACE!!! 
 
This game is really three smaller games. You select what to play to choosing which character you 
want. 
For Captain Link Hogthrob, it is Chickenvaders. A Pigs in Space take in Atari's Atari 2600 version of 
Space Invaders. 
While exploring the planet Cluck, our intrepid hero was set upon by space chickens. Captain Link must 
destroy them before they make their way all the way to the planet. He does this by firing link 
sausages up at the chickens. But the chickens are not helpless. They are dropping space chicken eggs. 
If one hits Link, he will be turned into...a chicken! You also lose a life. From time to time, Gonzo 
flies across the screen top in his saucer. You can hit him for points also. 
 
Scoring 
Hitting a chicken on... 
Row one=10 points 
Row two=20 points 
Row three=50 points 
Row four=70 points 
Row five=100 points 
Hitting Gonzo=300 points 
Destroying all the chickens=1000 point bonus 
 
If you select First Mate Piggy, you play Pastaroids. Somehow, Piggy has been ejected from the 
Swinetrek into a pastaroid storm. You must guide Piggy from the bottom of the screen to the top and 
board the Swinetrek before it leaves. If you touch a flying meatball or spaghetti strand, you will 
lose ground, and thus time. You can press fire to give a meat ball a karate chop for points but don't 
dawdle. 
 
Scoring 
Karate-chopping a meat ball=100 points 
Boarding the Swinetrek=1000 points 
 
If you select Dr. Strangepork, you play Escape from Planet of the Gonzoids. The Swinetrek has gotten 
trapped in an abandoned pizza mine still being guarded by robotic Gonzoids, created by Gonzo. The 
Gonzoids are standing on ledges, throwing pizzas across the mine, You have a weapon called the 
Boomeray. When you fire, it goes up then curves to the side, hopefully landing on a Gonzoid. The 
direction it curves depends on which way you move before you fire. If you are hit by a pizza, hit the 
mine walls or are hit by your dropping Boomeray shot, you lose a life. 
 
Scoring 
You get one point for every mile you get through the mine. 
Hitting a Gonzoid=100 points 
Escaping the mine=1000 points 
 
The difficulty switches do nothing. The only game selections are one player or two player, 
alternating.

Pitfall! is a platform action game. You play Pitfall Harry who is on a quest to locate treasure deep 
in the jungle. With a little luck you'll be able to find money bags, silver bars, gold bars, and 
diamond rings. But many obstacles will get in the way, some of which merely deduct points from your 
score, while others are fatal. Rolling logs and falling down a hole will deduct points, and 
scorpions, alligators, snakes, bottomless pits, swamps, and fires will cause Pitfall Harry to lose a 
life. You have 20 minutes to try to collect all of the treasures on the numerous screens, if you can 
live that long!

Die Ente und der Wolf (c) 1982 Konami Industry Co. Ltd. / Konami, Inc. 
 
In this remake of the arcade game Pooyan from the early '80s, you play the role of a pig, protecting 
its piglets from wolves. 
 
The first screen takes place near the pigs' home.  Mrs. Pig rides up and down in a cable car, 
shooting at wolves, who are riding balloons downward, towards the ground.  If the wolves land safely 
on the ground, then they can climb a ladder, near the cable-car, and catch Mrs. Pig.  But if she 
shoots their balloons, they splat on the ground instead. 
 
The wolves shoot acorns at the pig.  But Mrs. Pig has a food based weapon too.  If she gets to the 
top, she can get meat, to toss at the wolves and make them jump off their balloons in pursuit.  Each 
wolf taken out this way is worth bonus points (on a doubling scheme: 400, 800 1600...) 
 
The second scene takes place at the wolves lair.  Here the wolves have reinforced balloons--it takes 
multiple hits to make them fall.  Here they float upwards toward a big rock, which they push on top 
of Mrs. Pig, when seven wolves are present.  Additionally, an alpha wolf (wolf leader) appears and 
summons wolves in packs.

You, the Ramroid, are on a track in the center of the screen. You can aim left and right to fire. On 
both sides are colored bars that begin to randomly advance towards the center. You must shoot these 
bars to drive them back, preferably off the screen. If a bar starts flashing, it is a bonus bar and 
shooting it gets you larger points as well as clearing it from the screen completely. Be warned, 
though, that sometimes the bar will reappear on the opposite side of the screen. 
 
A round ends when: 
1. You have cleared all the colored bars from the screen or 
2. The timer at the bottom, which starts at five thousand, reaches zero or 
3. The colored bars have blocked off part of the screen and you clear the rods where you can

on the floor or he can let it bounce but you can only let it bounce once. It cannot bounce twice. You 
serve every time until you miss. If you are serving and your opponent misses, you get one point. You 
can only get points on rounds where you serve. First player to twenty-one points, wins.

Raster Fahndung (2006) (Homebrew) (c) Dec 14, 2007 
 
You are presented with a screen full of squares, thirty-two squares wide by twenty squares high. The 
object of the game is to find a particular set of squares that measure six by six squares. This 
sounds simple but you are timed. You can view the pattern you need by pressing fire but don't stay 
long as this makes the timer speed up to twice as fast while you are in that screen. In a two player 
game, the first player to find the correct pattern collects one point. The game ends when the timer 
runs out or, in two player, one player reaches nine points. 
 
You start with ninety seconds. If you select the easy difficulty, the second puzzle with have five 
less seconds. Time decreases per screen until you reach twenty seconds, the lowest time. On the hard 
setting, you have to clear as many boards as you can in ninety seconds, total.

long or your chute won't open at all! For each jump, there will be varying wind conditions which blow 
your sky diver off course. A wind sock at the bottom of the screen will help you determine the wind 
speed and direction so you can compensate. There are nine jumps total, and the player with the most 
points at the end wins.

Fly slalom around pylons (right of the red ones, left of the blue ones). Avoid skipping a pylon, 
hitting the pylons, trees or hot-air balloons. Try to get the best time you can. If you fly to the 
wrong side of a pylon, you will get a three second penalty for each missed pylon. The total number of 
pylons remaining is at the top of the screen above the time. If you hit a tree, pylon or balloon your 
plane will crash to the ground. You will not die but this will hurt your time as your plane has to 
take off again. Hitting a pylon will not hurt your pylon count. You will still get credit for the 
pylon but will lose time as your plane was slowed. You can press the fire button to throttle up or 
release to throttle down. Move the joystick left or right to turn. You bank into turns so you need to 
time turns as it is not instant. Up and down on the joystick do nothing.

In Solar Fox, your mission is to guide a space ship though a solar cell matrix and collect as many of 
the solar cells as you can. When all of the cells in a matrix have been collected, you move on to the 
next round. Each matrix is guarded by two sentinels trying to stop you. The sentinels wander around 
the perimeter of the matrix, and will shoot fireballs at your spaceship which can destroy it. You are 
unarmed, so your only defense against the fireballs is to avoid them. To help you out a bit, your 
ship is capable of flying at two different speeds. Each round begins with a 'skip-a-rack' timer

you must now carry humanoids to safety through the Stargate of the title.

existing humanoids, and trying to advance your position

A cockpit view space shooter very similar to Star Raiders but not requiring a keypad. In your 
starship, you must warp to sectors of space containing enemy starships. Here you will engage and 
destroy them before they can surround and destroy your starbases.   In a starbase sector, use your 
joystick to guide your reticle to the starbase when it is near you for repair and/or refueling. In a 
fight, you can take damage. If you see a L, it meas your lasers are out of commission. This mean you 
cannot fire (this is not good in a fight!). If you see a W, it means your warp drive is damaged. You 
will use twice as much fuel when warping. If you see an S, it means your shields are out. If you are 
hit again with no shields, you will be destroyed. If you see an R, it means your radar is damaged. 
You will not be able to see the enemies on the starmap until you get the radar fixed. All your 
starbases will still show with damaged radar except any that have been destroyed. When warping, if 
the screen at the bottom is green, you are headed to an empty sector. If it is red, you are headed to 
a sector with enemies in it. If it is blue, you are headed to a sector with a starbase in it. The 
game ends when either all the enemies are destroyed or you are destroyed. Your final score is 
determined by your base score plus 100 points per enemy destroyed minus 500 points per starbase 
destroyed minus 100 points per each time you docked at a starbase minus 1 point per stardate.

is equipped with a hose and an unlimited water supply to help you put out the fires. You need to be 
quick, however, for if you take too long the survivors will die! When you rescue as many survivors as 
you can and make it back out of the room, the floor is complete and a helicopter will transport you 
to the next floor. Although it isn't necessary to put out all of the fires on a floor, you will earn 
bonus points if you do. The higher you get in the building, the tougher the game becomes. Gameplay is 
for one or two players, and several game variations and difficulty levels are available.

Billard (c) 1982 Imagic / Imagic 
 
Trick Shot is a pool game for one or two players. You can choose to play pool (first player to 25 
points wins), billiards (first player to 50 points wins), trickshot (attempt to earn points by 
sinking all of the balls on the table in a single shot), or trickshot practice game variations. 
During the game you use the joystick to control a cursor which aims the cue ball. By holding down the 
button you control the amount of power in a shot (the longer you hold down the button, the more power 
the cue ball is hit with). You may also apply some English by moving the joystick while hitting the 
cue ball. At the end of the game a trophy will appear on screen to indicate who the winner is!

Turmoill (c) 1982 Sirius Software, Inc. / Fox Video Games, Inc. 
 
Turmoil is a fast-paced shooter. You pilot a ship that is trapped within a chamber of seven tunnels.  
Your ship can only move up and down along a vertical corridor connecting the tunnels.  You are not 
alone, however.  A variety of enemies travel along these tunnels, focused on destroying you.  
Therefore, the ultimate objective of “Turmoil” is to zoom up and down the center alley and blast 
aliens as they streak by.  Keep shooting and keep moving, and you will survive to live another day!  
As you move quickly up and down, you must also fire your own weapons into to the left or right side.  
Part of the intensity of this game is driven by the fact that you can't stay in one place for too 
long.  If you do, an indestructible enemy will come flying at you, forcing to move onward once more. 
 
The enemy ships you will encounter in each of the seven tunnels travel at a variety of unique speeds. 
 The faster a given enemy moves, the more points you will receive if you shoot them.  Occasionally 
when you destroy one of the enemy ships, a flashing orb will appear at the far end of the tunnel.  
This is the one exception where you are not restricted to your vertical pathway.  In these situations 
you are allowed to move down the tunnel to recover it.  If you grab it quickly, it is worth bonus 
points.  If you hesitate, it hatches into a fast moving missile and will destroy you if you get in 
its way. 
 
When you start a game of Turmoil, you are given five ships.  If you can blast all of the aliens in a 
level, you'll receive a bonus ship.  In addition to your current ship, you can hold as many as six 
reserve ships at one time.  You will loose a ship if you make contact with any of the passing aliens. 
 There are nine levels to the game, each with multiple waves to complete, and each one faster and 
more challenging then the previous level.  This is considered by many to be one of 20th Century Fox's 
best games.

Video Olympics Black by neotokeo2001 (c) 1977 Atari, Inc. / Atari, Inc. 
 
Video Olympics is an action game containing numerous variations of the game Pong. Two players (or one 
player against the computer) control paddles on the screen and attempt to prevent a bouncing ball 
from getting past them. In the most basic game variations, each player has a single paddle and there 
are no obstacles on the screen. The other game variations add paddles and obstacles, and some are 
loosely inspired by various sports and change the playfield around, but the goal remains the same: 
hit the ball past your opponents paddle into the goal to earn points. A few of these variations are: 
 
1. Foozpong: Each player controls multiple paddles which are arranged somewhat like a foozball 
   table. 
 
2. Soccer pong: Each player controls two paddles (representing one goalie and one player) and the 
   goal is much narrower. 
 
3. Hockey pong: The playfield is set up to resemble hockey

space stations and, eventually, your homeworld.  Assemble your band of engineers and fight the Xenos 
on each station, striving to either clear it or abandon it.  You start out with a standard issue 
laser, but can pick up additiona weapons as you find them, including Phasers, Lightning Rifles, 
Poofer guns, and bombs. 
 
Xenophobe was originally an arcade coin-op by Bally/Midway, released in 1987.  Gameplay premise and

one to five robbers may also be placed in the maze. If you are caught by one of the robbers, you will

To be born with wings... 
 
Become a F-14 Naval Aviator undergoing seek and destroy missions while dodging and gunning enemy 
bogeys in deadly dogfights with your 20mm cannon and air-to-air missiles. 
 
You cockpit comes with state of the art technology, courtesy of the U.S. Air Force: Display and main 
computer, Bogey Alert Indicator, G-Force Indicator, Electronic Counter Measures, and a Cannon 
Overheat Indicator (yes, it can overheat!)...and if your feeling up to it, give the ol'bird a boost 
to Mach 1.0! 
 
The gameplay like other simulation games consists of taking off, flying, combat and landing. Though 
most of the gameplay focuses around dogfighting with enemy bogeys (dodging missiles). In addition to 
that, there are also night-flying missions that add difficulty due to limited vision. 
 
Taking off and landing however, also required additional skill as your doing it on the USS Enterprise 
(No relation to Star Trek), not on your standard airstrip. Pay attention to the F.D. officer as your 
preparing to take off (since he's the boss when it comes to this stuff...and try no to run over 
him...yet). 
 
Your weaponry consists of a M 61 Machine Gun and 3 different AIM Missiles (AIM 7, 9, 54) each packed 
with 15 missiles (that's a lot of missiles!). 
 
After each mission you will receive a Mission Rating which is based on your flying skill, number of 
bogey kill and number of weapons fired.
