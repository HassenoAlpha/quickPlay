Biomotor Unitron (c) 1999 Yumekobo Co., Ltd. / SNK 
Corporation of America 
 
Biomotor Unitron is a RPG for the Neo Geo Pocket 
Color. 
 
After a meteor brings a new source of energy to 
the world, the construction of giant robots 
begins. These robots are used for entertainment 
and fight in arena fights against one-another for 
the title Master of Masters. You play a duo of 
characters that participates in these gladiator 
battles. You can control both characters and have 
to explore and perform quests to earn money and 
items to upgrade your Unitron robot with. You can 
talk to inhabitants of the city and buy new items 
at stores. 
 
The Unitron changes visibly when you apply 
upgrades and a great deal of upgrades are at hand. 
Over two hundred different weapon configurations 
are possible. Each weapon and part has a certain 
material and element. Fire weapons will work 
better against wooden robots than water-based 
robots. 
 
Beneath the city there are large dungeons where 
most quests will have to be solved and most items 
will be found. 
 
The battles are like in Pokémon, completely menu 
based. You pick whatever powers you want to use 
from a drop-down list.

Crush Roller (c) 1999 ADK Corporation / SNK 
Corporation of America 
 
Crush Roller is a game for the Neo Geo Pocket 
Color based on the 1981 arcade game Make Trax, 
which was released as Crush Roller in Europe and 
Asia. 
 
The object of the game is to color the entire 
maze-like playing field with a paint brush. While 
you paint, two enemies walk around in the maze, 
when they hit you, you lose a life. 
 
A level has rollers which you can push forward 
with your paint brush. If you capture an enemy in 
the path of the roller he dies and is temporarily 
taken out of the game. This scores you extra 
points. Each subsequent enemy rolled over is worth 
more points. 
 
Every once in a while another creature will pop 
up, it will run around leaving behind track marks 
in your paint. Painting over this creature removes 
it from the game and scores you additional points. 
His tracks have to be repainted. 
 
When the entire maze is painted you win the level. 
Unlike the original arcade version the Neo Geo 
Pocket Color version has multiple levels.

Densetsu no Ogre Battle (c) Jun 22, 2000 Quest / 
SNK Corporation 
 
A side story to the original Ogre Battle game for 
the SNES, Zenobia no Ouji's side-story takes place 
during the fourteenth chapter ("The Capital of 
Milano") of the original game. 
 
Much like its predecessor, the game is a unique 
blend of traditional RPG and strategy gameplay. As 
the hero of the game, you lead a growing army of 
troops as you progress through the game in a 
series of pivotal battles. Before each battle you 
are given the option to setup your army into 
distinct groups. Then you are given a mission on 
the map and you can then set your army out to do 
your bidding. As your unit groups travel along the 
map on the way to their given objective, they'll 
happen along enemy unit groups. When they meet, 
the game switches to an isometric-view of the 
automated turn-based battle that ensues.

Densha de Go! 2 (c) Oct 21, 1999 Taito GM R&D 
Sect. #2 / SNK Corporation 
 
The 1998 sequel of the popular Japanese train 
driving game by Taito has once again been ported 
to various home systems. For the first time on the 
PlayStation, it is possible to drive through the 
snow, and take a seat in the cockpit of a 
Shinkansen bullet train. 
 
The gameplay is more arcade than simulation. The 
focus is on stopping at the stations at the 
perfect moment and position, keeping up with the 
schedule, obeying signals and speed limits, and 
ensuring the safety and comfort of the passengers. 
Mistakes result in points being deducted from a 
counter. If it reaches 0, the game is over. 
 
The following routes are available: 
 
1. Hokuhoku Line from Naoetsu to Uragawara 
2. Tohoku Shinkansen from Morioka to 
   Shin-Hanamaki 
3. Akita Shinkansen from Akita to Omagari 
4. Keihin-Tohoku Line from Shinagawa to Ueno 
5. Osaka Loop Line from Osaka to Tennoji (not

Dive Alert - Becky&apos;s Version (c) Aug 19, 1999 
Sacnoth / SNK Corporation 
 
Dive Alert: Becky's Version is an RPG for the Neo 
Geo Pocket Color. There is another version of Dive 
Alert called Dive Alert: Matt's Version. The two 
games are rather like joint Pokemon releases 
(Red/Blue, etc) wherein they are overall the same 
game with a variety of smaller differences. 
 
The player takes control of a character named 
Becky. The game takes place in the future and the 
world is primarily surrounded by water. The only 
land is a small patch called Terra. The player 
must prove their worth to be accepted on to Terra 
by proving their skill as a submarine commander 
and destroying enemy vessels. 
 
Becky's version features different characters, 
items and boats from Matt's Version. These are 
logged in a device similar to a Pokédex (from 
Pokemon). Battles take place against enemy ships 
and a radar view is used to help the player guide 
torpedoes towards the enemy vessels. Much of the 
game is text-based with animated cutscenes. 
 
The game features the ability for two players to 
link up Neo Geo Pocket Color units to exchanges 
ships and data, and to battle one on one.  The 
game also features battery back-up and a training 
mode.

Evolution - Eternal Dungeons (c) 2000 ESP / SEGA 
Corporation 
 
A portable version of Evolution: The World of 
Sacred Device. Eternal Dungeon tells the story of 
the young explorer Mag Launcher and his quest for 
the fabled Evolutia, an item of immense power. 
 
The basic premise of the game is to take quests in 
the town and then assemble your party and attempt 
to clear out the many dungeons in the game, 
grinding your characters and getting the loot and 
experience needed to advance the plot and buy 
items, equipment, and upgrades for your Cy-frame, 
a robotic attachment that enables Mag to enhance 
his combat abilities. 
 
As expected for a portable version, the gameplay 
has been significantly downgraded from its 
original Dreamcast version. Town navigation is 
menu-driven and all graphics are now top-down 2D 
sprites, with all dungeons being pre-designed 
instead of randomly generated. Combat is 
turn-based using a menu system from which you 
select your actions for each party member (up to 
3) and execute them, but otherwise remains 
unchanged.

Cotton - Fantastic Night Dreams (c) 2000 Success 
Corp. / SNK Europe Ltd. 
 
Fantastic Night Dreams: Cotton is a 2D 
side-scrolling shooter in which the player takes 
the role of the young witch Cotton, who sets out 
on her magical broom on a quest to get her 
favorite candy. Fortunately for us her obsession 
gets her in the way of several world-threatening 
terrors that she must destroy in standard shooter 
fare. 
 
The game features an experience-earning system in 
which the more enemies the player kills the more 
he can upgrade his weapon by collecting power 
crystals. Players can also charge their weapon for 
special attacks and enlist the aid of Silk, 
Cotton's magical fairy friend who can form up in 
different "option" configurations.

Faselei! (c) Dec 29, 1999 Sacnoth / SNK 
Corporation 
 
Faselei! is one of the last titles to be released 
for the Neo Geo Pocket Color and even features 
digitised lyrics to the game's main theme. Heavily 
story driven, this strategy RPG takes place in a 
time when mechs known as TS are the weapon of 
choice for combat. Gameplay revolves around the 
battles and customising your TS between those 
battles. 
 
Battles are part turn based and part realtime. The 
player inputs their actions at the beginning of 
the turn. The amount of actions they can input is 
dependant on their type of TS. Once they have 
finished their selection everything is played out 
in realtime for the duration of the turn. This 
makes thinking about what your opponents and 
allies will do in advance essential before taking 
your turn.

Fatal Fury F-Contact (c) May, 1999 SNK Corporation 
/ SNK of America 
 
Using the world-famous Japanese "SD" 
(Super-Deformed) artwork style, this is the only 
title of the Fatal Fury series to be released on 
SNK's color handheld. 
 
The game is based on its arcade/console 
counterpart Real Bout Fatal Fury 2: The Newcomers, 
and has its main characteristics, like the 
possibility of execute special moves while 
blocking (a.k.a. Breakshots), the execution of 
high-strength blows (a.k.a. S. Power and P. Power 
moves) and the starring of two new combatants (Li 
Xiangfei and Rick Strowd). 
 
Due to NGPC hardware limitations, some characters 
have been removed from the main cast (as well as 
the background/foreground battle plane system). 
With this, the fighters initially available for 
this contest are: Andy Bogard, Terry Bogard, Joe 
Higashi, Mai Shiranui, Kim Kaphwan, Ryuji 
Yamazaki, Rick Strowd, Li Xiangfei, Billy Kane, 
Wolfgang Krauser and Geese Howard.

Ganbare NeoPoke Kun (c) Jun 08, 2000 SNK 
Corporation / SNK Corporation 
 
In this unique game you keep watch on the wacky 
Neo Poke-kun, a cartoony programmer...thing that 
lives locked in his small Tokyo apartment. You 
don't have direct control of his actions but 
instead interact with him indirectly by switching 
stuff in his apartment on and off, which triggers 
different reactions from him. More importantly you 
can invite different characters to visit Neo 
Poke-kun, which will also trigger different 
reactions from him. Depending on the time of day 
and the visitor you may get different reactions 
from Poke-kun, and if you make him happy enough 
he'll get to work and code a mini-game for you. 
 
These collection of 30 games form the bulk of the 
gameplay, and include different clones of other 
games, shooters, short platformers, and compact 
puzzle challenges similar to Wario Ware 
 
The game has a distinctly bizarre sense of humor 
with tons of wacky animations played whenever 
something happens to your Poke-kun, and while some 
games use basic vector graphics, most use 2D 
sprites.

Kikou Seik Unitron is the sequel to Biomotor

original. This time you control 10 characters. 
Like the original your main priorities are 
upgrading your Unitron robot. The game features 
more dungeons than the original and they are 
partly randomized on each play through. Using a 
link cable you can pit your Unitron against that 
of friends.

King of Fighters R-2 (c) Mar 19, 1999 SNK 
Corporation / SNK of America 
 
Using again the Japanese "SD" (Super-Deformed) 
artwork style (now reworked), the KOF Series makes 
your debut in the new SNK's color handheld. The 
title brings the same gameplay characteristics 
present in its arcade/console counter-part The 
King of Fighters '98, like the possibility of 
choose between two game modes (Advanced or Extra), 
an identical adaptation of the battle stages, the 
addition of "Advantage System" (directly related 
to the power gauges) and the chance to battle with 
a powered version of the "franchise boss", Rugal 
Bernstein. 
 
Unlike the previous game (The King of Fighters 
R-1), this sequence doesn't have a defined 
storyline, but it's implicit that Rugal is still 
alive and returns once again to try conquer the 
world and satisfy his evil ambitions. 
 
The teams included in the game were slightly 
reformulated and now are the following ones (this 
time, Leona Heidern and Iori Yagami are single 
entries): 
 
1. Team Kusanagi (Kyo Kusanagi, Saisyu Kusanagi 
   and Shingo Yabuki)Super Babe Team (Athena 
   Asamiya, Yuri Sakazaki and Kasumi Todo) 
2. New Southtown Team (Ryo Sakazaki, Mai

Last Blade, The - Beyond the Destiny (c) Mar 16, 
2000 SNK Corporation / SNK Corporation 
 
A port of the successful 2D fighter Last Blade for 
the NeoGeo Pocket Color. The port features nearly 
all the characters featured in the original game 
clashing against each other using a limited color 
palette and a new super-deformed character design, 
but otherwise identically as in their arcade 
counterpart. You select your character from a 
selection of swordsmen and then proceed to fight 
and defeat all your opponents in a one-on-one 
fighting tournament involving weapon fighting a la 
Samurai Shodown. 
 
Unique to the port is the fact that it allows you 
to unlock and play as characters from Last Blade 2 
and in fact eventually unlock the full storyline 
for the sequel, making the game sort of a 
compilation of both released games in the series.

you want to hit the ball, then adjust hook, slice, 
and power. In Versus mode, you can earn 
"super-clubs" that can only be used once. These

One of the most popular and influential games of

dot-muncher who works his way around to clear a 
maze of the various dots and fruit which inhabit 
the board. 
 
Pac-Man's goal is continually challenged by 
   four ghosts: The shy blue ghost Bashful (Inky), 
   the trailing red ghost Shadow (Blinky), the 
   fast pink ghost Speedy (Pinky), and the 
   forgetful orange ghost Pokey (Clyde).  One 
   touch from any of these ghosts means a loss of 
   life for Pac-Man. 
 
Pac-Man can turn the tables on his pursuers by 
   eating of the four Energizers located within 
   the maze.  During this time, the ghosts turn 
   blue, and Pac-Man can eat them for bonus 
   points.  This only lasts for a limited amount 
   of time, as the ghost's eyes float back to 
   their center box, and regenerate to chase after 
   Pac-Man again. 
 
Survive a few rounds of gameplay, and be treated 
to humorous intermissions between Pac-Man and the 
ghosts.

Puzzle Link (c) 1999 Yumekobo Co., Ltd. / SNK

Puzzle Link is a game where blocks of matching 
color have to be dissolved. New blocks constantly 
scroll into the screen from the top. The game is 
over when the first blocks reach the bottom of the 
screen. You can dissolve blocks by shooting at 
them. The shots form a line where they impact. If 
that line connects otherwise unconnected blocks of 
the same color they will dissolve. 
 
There are three different modes: In "Normal" you 
have to link two special blocks that appear after 
some time. If you manage to finish the level 
within the time limit you will unlock one of 50 
collectible cards. In "Clear Mode" you have to 
clear a given constellation of blocks. "Battle 
Mode" is a two player link-cable mode.

There are new modes in Puzzle Link 2. Like the 
original, there are the standard challenge and 
puzzle rounds. But new to the series is the 
marathon-style game where you continue eliminating 
pieces as the game gradually increases speed. In 
this mode, more power-ups appear as the player 
performs faster. Here, you get three shots that 
will eliminate the same color tile from the board. 
The game also has link cable support for two 
players.

Evolution (c) 2000 ESP / SEGA Corporation 
 
A portable version of Evolution: The World of 
Sacred Device. Eternal Dungeon tells the story of 
the young explorer Mag Launcher and his quest for 
the fabled Evolutia, an item of immense power. 
 
The basic premise of the game is to take quests in 
the town and then assemble your party and attempt 
to clear out the many dungeons in the game, 
grinding your characters and getting the loot and 
experience needed to advance the plot and buy 
items, equipment, and upgrades for your Cy-frame, 
a robotic attachment that enables Mag to enhance 
his combat abilities. 
 
As expected for a portable version, the gameplay 
has been significantly downgraded from its 
original Dreamcast version. Town navigation is 
menu-driven and all graphics are now top-down 2D 
sprites, with all dungeons being pre-designed 
instead of randomly generated. Combat is 
turn-based using a menu system from which you 
select your actions for each party member (up to 
3) and execute them, but otherwise remains 
unchanged.
