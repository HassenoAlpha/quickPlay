Addams Family, The (c) 1993 Arc Developments / Flying Edge, Inc. 
 
The Addams Family is a side-scrolling platformer based on the movie of the same name. The player 
takes the role of Gomez who searches for his missing family members. To find them he has to explore 
six different parts of the mansion, e.g. the woods, which are basic platform levels: the player moves 
from left to right while jumping a lot and avoiding enemies. Some of them can be dispatched of by a 
jump on their heads. 
 
The main difference to the other versions of this game is a unique level design. There is also a life 
meter which allows to get hit more often before dying.

Alien 3 (c) 1994 Probe Software Ltd. / Arena Entertainment 
 
Alien³ is a video game based on the movie sequel of the same name. The plot of the movie picks up 
directly after the end of Aliens. Ellen Ripley, the main character of the Alien series, is in 
cryo-sleep aboard the space ship Sulaco. Unfortunately, an alien or two has stowed away on the 
Sulaco, and wreaked havoc within the ship.  Thus, it crash lands on the prison colony planet Fiorina 
161.  Ripley and the unarmed prisoners have to figure out a way to survive the aliens terrorizing the 
colony until help arrives. 
 
The game play of the various Alien³ conversions varies from platform to platform. The Genesis Alien³ 
game is a side-scrolling action game with large maze-like levels. In each level, you have to rescue 
all the trapped prisoners and then make your way to the exit, all while surviving multiple alien 
attacks.

Andre Agassi Tennis (c) 1994 TecMagik Entertainment Ltd. / Lance Investments 
 
A game endorsed by the American player who stunned the tennis world in the early 90s with his "Image 
is everything" looks, sporting long hair, earrings and colorful shirts, Andre Agassi Tennis includes 
eight players (male and female and as as expected, only Agassi is a real player) rated according to 
movement speed and both accuracy and strength on serve, backhand and forehand. 
 
Gameplay features all the usual moves: smashes, passing shots, volleys and all kinds of backhand and 
forehand plays, but unlike other games, precise positioning and timing are crucial to avoid hitting 
the ball outside the court, swinging the racket into thin air or more embarrassing, let the ball hit 
you on the head. 
Three courts are available: Grass, Clay and Indoor (Sega versions  add a fourth, Hard), but the 
differences between them are minimal. Game modes change according to the version, with the 16-bit 
versions including a "Skins" game, where each point is worth a sum of money based on the number of 
times the ball was hit.

Arena - Maze of Death (c) 1995 Eden Entertainment Software Ltd. / SEGA of America, Inc. 
 
In the year 2026, a corrupt government has used a television broadcasting company called Astralnet 
Broadcasting Company to secretly control the population and keep them brainwashed.  During these 
times a group of pro-democratic rebels, led by Guy Freelander, has obtained a secret taped meeting 
between top government officials and ABC directors discussing their diabolical plans.  Convinced that 
if they play the tape through ABC's broadcasting, they can convince the repressed population to rise 
up against the current regime.  The only problem that stands in their way is the way to the 
broadcasting center, a death trap nicknamed the maze. 
 
The player takes control of Guy Freelander and must transverse this maze, with 20 levels and 100 
different rooms in total, using a standard gun and a knife to take out security guards, androids, 
mutants and must avoid various pitfalls and traps scattered in these rooms.  The view of the game is 
isometric and has a password feature to allow players to pick up and return to the previous room they 
were in without having to replay the previous levels.  There are no life bars, instead the player can 
take four hits before their character dies with five lives.  After losing these five lives, the game 
will be over.

all liberate the village Orvio and rescue their friend Dogmatix. 
 
You can play as either Asterix or Obelix. You make your way through platform levels, fighting enemies 
by punching them, and jumping to access higher ares or to avoid falling down. There are also some 
items you can collect, such as bombs, with which you can overcome obstacles and advance in the game.

Astrix and the Secret Mission (c) 1993 SEGA Enterprises Ltd. / SEGA Enterprises Ltd. 
 
The druid Getafix is out of magic potion, and Astérix and Obelix are set out on a secret mission: to 
find the necessary herbs, so he can brew the potion again. 
 
In this side-scrolling action game, the player can choose to play either Astérix or Obelix at the 
start of each one of the six levels. Although the main setting of each level is the same to both 
characters (forests, caves, deserts, underwater stages, waterfalls and such) the level design for 
each one may vary. In two player mode (Master System version), players will take turns playing as 
Astérix and Obelix. Both characters jump (by pressing button 2), punch enemies and break blocks (by 
pressing button 1). Astérix can run can run (by pressing and holding button 1 while moving) and 
double jump (by pressing 2 in the middle of a jump). Obélix is stronger and can break several bricks 
in a row when jumping over them (pressing 1 while jumping), and can also slide down hills (by 
pressing down at them). 
 
Astérix can get some potions (thrown by pressing up and 1), which can break rocks, kill or shrink 
enemies. Obelix can get miniature menhirs which can be thrown (by pressing up and 1) against enemies. 
Both characters can also get bones throughout the game, granting access to bonus stages where the 
player controls Dogmatix. Some levels also involve minor puzzle solving, like pushing switches or 
moving rock blocks.

Ax Battler - A Legend of Golden Axe (c) 1992 SEGA Enterprises Ltd. / SEGA of America, Inc. 
 
The legendary Golden Axe has been stolen by an army of evil warriors. The king called a young warrior 
to take it back. His name was... Ax Battler! 
 
Ax Battler: A Legend of Golden Axe is an action/adventure RPG which puts the player in the role of Ax 
Battler, the Barbarian from previous Golden Axe games in search for the Golden Axe. The gameplay 
feels much like Zelda II: The Adventure of Link, with Ax moving around in a top-down perspective, 
changing to a side scrolling view when fighting enemies or entering caves. 
 
The battles are random and Ax won't see the enemies coming. If he's hit during a battle, the battle 
will end instantly and he'll be sent back to the overworld map. If he prevails, he gets magic vases 
from the enemies. Magic vases are the game's currency and are also used to cast spells, just like in 
the other Golden Axe games, but instead of having only the "Earth" magic, he also has the "Thunder" 
and "Fire" magics. Ax can also use special attacks to fight his enemies, learned at "dojos" found in 
each city. 
 
Instead of battery backed RAM, this game uses passwords as a mean to save games. At each town the 
player enters, he'll find a place to learn a new password which, when entered, allows him to continue 
from the very point it was learned.

Ayrton Senna's Super Monaco GP II (c) Aug 28, 1992 SEGA Enterprises Ltd. / SEGA Enterprises Ltd. 
 
Ayrton Senna won the Monaco Grand Prix six times, as well as 3 Formula One world championships, so he 
was the perfect man to license a home sequel to the classic arcade racing game. As before, the action 
is viewed from within the cockpit, but depicted using sprites rather than polygons. 
 
There are three main modes: 
 
1. Senna GP: Features three non-championship circuits with a preliminary race followed by three 
   laps. 
 
2. World Championship: The full 16-race championship. There are two modes in the championship mode 
   that affect how the game is played. Beginner is a regular season, with the same difficulty level 
   as the remaining modes, and cars have roughly the same power. Each race has three laps. In Master 
   things get a twist. There are five groups of cars, and the player starts on the lowly competitive 
   SERGA team. To climb the ranks and get a chance of claim the title the player must challenge a 
   driver from other team and beat him to the top spot. The winner of this particular race gets (or 
   holds) the fastest car. Races are also longer in this mode, and pit-stops are activated, required 
   if the player knocks on too many objects or other cars frequently. 
 
3. Free Practice: This allows the player to drive on any race without caring for championship 
   positions. There are two options in Free Practice: Free Run is just the player against the clock 
   and Image Training is a race, but instead of having to quality and then run the three laps, the 
   player can set the number of laps (between one and six), starting position and the condition of 
   the track (dry or wet, only on some circuits). 
 
While each mode presents it's own variations, the core of each race is the same: Along controller 
setup options, the player can choose between an Automatic or Manual with 4 or 7 speeds gearbox, and 
races against 16 drivers. The car can be instantly wrecked if it goes on top speed against a roadside 
object.

Baku Baku Animal (c) Jan 26, 1996 SEGA Enterprises Ltd. / SEGA Enterprises Ltd. 
 
The Minister approaches the King to tell him that his only daughter, the Princess, wants a new pet. 
But the King says she already has too many, and she can't take care of so many animals. Thus the 
Minister purposes a contest of skill and daring to select the Royal Zookeeper. Master Piggy then 
sends his pupil, Polly, to participate in the contest. 
 
Baku Baku Animal is a variation on the very often copied Tetris type of game. The game has three 
different play modes: practice, normal and hard. It also can be played by two players against each 
other (except for the Master System version). 
 
The objective is to pair animal heads with their respective food. If a rabbit head comes falling, you 
must make it fall on a pile of carrot tiles, dog heads with bones, panda heads with bamboos and 
monkey heads with bananas. There is a bonus item, the "BB coin", which will appear from times to 
times, and remove piled tiles from the playfield. Removed tiles will be sent to the opponent's 
playfield all at once, increasing the difficulty of the task. Polly will face several contestants, 
and she'll win when her opponents get their playfield piled to the top.

Batman Forever is the officially licensed game based on the 1995 movie. The bad guys this time around

This game is an usual hybrid of side-scrolling platformer and one-on-one fighter. The player makes

like in a fighting game. The player's arsenal includes a lot of nifty bat-gadgets and a collection of

Batman Returns (c) 1992 Aspect Co. Ltd. / SEGA of America, Inc. 
 
From Sega 8-bit specialists Aspect comes one of many adaptations of Tim Burton's 1992 superhero 
sequel Batman Returns. Like other versions, it is a side-scrolling platformer. While very similar to 
the Master System version, the Game Gear version has slightly different levels and gameplay 
mechanics. 
 
Batman must move through five stages on his way to defeat the Penguin. These include the streets and 
rooftops of Gotham City, Max Shreck's department store, the sewers, and the Penguin's lair. For the 
first four levels, a route can be selected from two options, allowing for different paths through the 
game. 
 
Enemies standing in Batman's way can be defeated by throwing the Batarang at them, which will take 
out most baddies with one or just a few hits, even though the weapon's range is limited. Other tools 
Batman can use are a grappling hook to pull himself up to higher levels or swing across dangerous 
areas, and his cape, which can be used as a parachute, for more control during falls. 
 
Unlike in the Master System version, Batman can take more than one hit: he has a health bar, which 
can be refilled with powerups hidden in bat symbols.

Battleship (c) 1993 Mindscape, Inc. / Mindscape, Inc. 
 
Battleship for the NES is like the pen and paper battleship game with a few notable differences. The 
changes include the grid size that is 12 by 8 instead of the standard 10 by 10, the 3-grid unit long 
submarine has been removed, and only one shot can be made per turn regardless of if it hits or not. 
The most notable difference is that multiple weapons can be used. Each ship carries a special weapon 
that can fire many missiles many points across a set grid, for instance in an X pattern. The bigger 
the ship, the larger the grid area. Each ship can only shoot the special missile once per game and if 
the ship carrying the weapon is destroyed then the weapon becomes unusable.

Just like in Soko-Ban, it is your goal to push a number of crates onto certain spots in order to 
finish a level. Finding the right way to move all the crates on the right spots becomes increasingly 
difficult and you have to plan numerous steps in advance in order not to block your own way. The game 
features over 25 levels with 10 sub-levels each one. You can always choose the order in which you 
want to complete the sub-levels, but you have to complete all sub-levels in order to advance to the 
next main-level. If you have finished the game or become hopelessly stuck, there is also an option to 
create your own levels.

Bram Stoker's Dracula (c) 1993 Probe Software Ltd. / Sony Imagesoft 
 
Bram Stroker's Dracula is a side-scroller platform game loosely based on the 1992 film of the same 
name. Players take the role of Jonathan Harker whose mission to to destroy Count Dracula by first 
heading to Transylvania and then London. 
 
Jonathan Harker can move left and right, jump and attack with a weapon, the most basic of which is a 
knife. The status display on the screen shows Harker's health bar, countdown timer to complete the 
level and currently held weapon.  Throughout the levels question mark boxes (similar to the Mario 
games) can be found, attacking these will reveal power ups which include health restoration, timer 
increase and new weapons. Among these new weapons are axes, daggers and a shotgun. Question mark 
boxes can also be used as platforms to reach other areas and enemies. Each stage is divided into two 
sections: the "Daytime" and the "Nighttime". These are entirely different levels comparable to stage 
1-a and 1-b. Harker must jump to various platforms and obstacles and defeat minor enemies throughout 
the levels. The end of a Nighttime level is usually guarded by a boss creature who must be defeated 
to progress.

Bubble Bobble (c) 1994 Taito Corporation / Taito America Corporation 
 
Bubble Bobble is the story of two humans, Bub and Bob who wander into the mysterious cave of monsters 
and magically turn into dinosaurs. The only way to transform back is to reach the end of the cave... 
 
Bubble Bobble is a platform game, with each level being a single screen. The enemies must be cleared 
from a level to go to the next one. With one player controlling Bub and the other controlling Bob, 
the player can jump and collect items for points (such as fruit). The real power Bub and Bob have 
however is the ability to blow bubbles. These bubbles can be as platforms to leap on, or to trap 
enemies. Enemies trapped in a bubble must be popped by jumping into them, wherein they'll turn to 
fruit. Additionally, power-ups sometimes float by in bubbles. They include lightning, which flies out 
horizontally at enemies, and water, which drags the player and enemies straight down flowing over 
platforms. Taking too long to complete any level will summon Baron Von Blubba, who will float around 
the screen trying to destroy the player.

Castle of Illusion starring Mickey Mouse (c) 1991 SEGA Enterprises Ltd. / SEGA of America, Inc. 
 
Sega's 8-bit systems received their own version of the Genesis' popular Disney platformer. Story and 
themes remain the same, but the game has unique levels and slightly different gameplay mechanics. 
 
To save his girlfriend Minnie from the evil witch Mizrabel, Mickey Mouse must venture into the Castle 
of Illusion. Crossing six levels (including a magical forest, a toy land and a candy world), he must 
collect the gems of the rainbow in order to confront and defeat the witch. 
 
Each level features unique obstacles, enemies and a final boss. The enemies can be defeated by 
jumping on top of them. An alternative way is to pick up objects lying around (like rocks in the 
forest or blue balls in the toy level) and throwing them at the enemies. Mickey's ability to pick up 
things and carry them around also leads to puzzle-oriented gameplay. By placing objects in the right 
spot and jumping off of them, he can get to areas otherwise out of reach. In some levels, he also has 
to collect keys to open doors. A unique type of object is the treasure chest - by jumping on top of 
one or throwing it, Mickey gets access to its contents, which might include extra lives, a health 
power-up or coins to collect for points.

and what car they drive. Then you drive across the city without crashing into other cars, and catch 
up with the criminal's car. To arrest the suspects, you must keep bumping into their car until it is 
no longer functional. And you have to do this under a strict time limit. You can't afford to crash 
into cars or buildings or you waste time getting on the road again. 
 
However, once you've caught up with your suspect, you are given more time. Your car is also equipped 
with turbo boosts, which you can use to gain extra speed if you are way behind the criminal. Each 
arrest is based on a "suspicion".

stone. A rival manufacturer becomes jealous of Chuck's abilities and kidnaps him.  Now it is up to 
Junior to rescue his dad! 
 
The gameplay in this sequel is similar to the first game, but with some minor differences since you 
are playing as Junior, rather than Chuck. This is a side-scrolling platform game with occasional 
rock-moving puzzles thrown in. Unlike Chuck, Junior carries a club that gives his attacks further

Columns (c) 1991 SEGA Enterprises Ltd. / SEGA of America, Inc. 
 
Columns is loosely derived from Tetris, as it involves arranging falling blocks in such a way as to 
clear them. However, in columns they are groups of 3 same-size but varying color blocks, which must 
be arranged into sequences of 3 or more, either horizontally, vertically or diagonally. Sequences of 
4 or 5 count for double or triple points, and diagonal sequences score the most. The real trick is to 
set up 'combos' - where one line causes other blocks to drop so as to create other lines. 
 
As well as the normal game mode, there is also a 'flash' mode, in which the aim is simply to remove a 
particular block from the base of the pre-formed pile of bricks. The difficulty of this can be 
determined by increasing the number of complete rows which are already in place.

Crystal Warriors (c) Dec 12, 1991 SEGA Corporation / SEGA Corporation 
 
The continent of Tyramus has lived in peace for almost a century, thanks to the four elemental 
crystals of the kingdom of Arliel. However, peace is threatened by the invading armies of the Jyn 
Empire, led by Emperor Grym, who wants to use the four crystals to rule over Tyramus. Fortunately, 
Princess Iris can escape with one of the crystals and now the player has to protect her and the 
crystal and somehow find a way to drive back the hordes of Jyn. 
 
Gameplay in Crystal Warriors is quite similar to Shining Force. The player fights in turn-based 
battles controlling different characters like fighters, healers, rangers and mages, all with 
different strengths and skills. Whenever two units engage in battle, they enter a duel mode lasting 
for up to two turns. In this mode the player can choose between four commands: "battle" (attack), 
"retreat", "spell" and "monster". While the first three commands are quite self-explanatory, the 
"monster" command is interesting. Whenever a non-human enemy is defeated, it can be tamed and be used 
in battles. While most monsters do not have many HP they can serve as good attackers for physically 
weak characters or take some hits in order to protect his master. 
In-between battles the player can visit towns to rest, buy weapons and spells or recruit new party 
   members.

Taisen-gata Daisenryaku G (c) Sep 28, 1991 SystemSoft / SystemSoft 
 
The Game Gear version of the grand old lady of war simulations, Daisenryaku, arranges a war between 
the fictive Red and Blue countries. On one of thirty different maps, units are produced and moved out 
into combat, and the war is only over when the enemy capital has been conquered. 
 
Three basic phases make up each turn: production, movement and combat. Each city or airbase within a 
distance of five hexagons from your capital may produce one unit each turn, as long as your funds 
allow it. Each turn yields new funds, whose amount is proportional to the number of cities and 
airports you have occupied. 
 
Units are moved on the map, which is based on "fake hexagons"

Deep Duck Trouble starring Donald Duck (c) 1993 Aspect Co. Ltd. / SEGA of America, Inc. 
 
Donald meets Hewey, Dewey and Louie, back from their latest adventure with Uncle Scrooge.  But Uncle 
Scrooge has been cursed by a pendant he found while adventuring, and is now floating in the air like 
a balloon!  He gives Donald his adventurer's diary and asks Donald to retrace his steps and return 
the pendant to its rightful place - this is the only thing that will return Scrooge to normal. 
 
Deep Duck Trouble is a platform game where you play as Donald Duck.  You must make your way through 
four different areas of the island - the jungle, an inlet, a volcano, and a valley - and defeat 
bosses at the end of each area.  Donald can defeat enemies by jumping on their heads.  He can also 
defeat them by kicking bricks which will may then hit his enemies.  Donald's trademark temper also 
comes into play: if he eats a chili pepper, he will become furious and plough through anything in his 
way, whether it be bricks or enemies!

Genki's first game is a paddle/pong game with a background story. Once upon a time there were a 
prince and a princess who loved each other. But the evil jealous demon named "Y" turn them both into 
stone paddles. Suddenly, a blue sphere fell from the sky, becoming the ball which the paddles can now 
push forwards, overcoming obstacles and defeating demons. 
 
"Devilish" is different from other paddle games by letting you play with two paddles. The lower one 
behaves just like a usual paddle - you use it to prevent the ball from dropping down. The upper one 
can move and turn, allowing you to hit the ball from different angles and from different parts of the 
screen. You advance through levels by destroying bricks and enemies, going up until the level boss 
enemy appears.

Sega's 8-bit systems received a unique adaptation of Disney's 1992 animated film Aladdin. 
 
Like other versions, it is a side-scrolling action game. The player controls Aladdin, making his way 
through a variety of locations, including the streets of Agrabah, the Cave of Wonders, the Sultan's 
palace and more. Gameplay takes several different forms: some levels are chases, where Aladdin runs 
automatically, but must be made to jump over chasms or rolling rocks and barrels, evade falling 
objects and avoid getting caught by a guard. Other levels are platforming affairs: Aladdin must run, 
jump and climb, find keys or switches to open doors while searching for the exit. Rocks can be 
collected and be thrown to dispatch enemies or hit buttons otherwise out of reach. Finally, there are 
also several magic carpet rides in the game, in which the level scrolls automatically and the player 
must make sure to avoid any obstacles in the way.

Dragon Crystal (c) Dec 22, 1992 SEGA Enterprises Ltd. / SEGA of America, Inc. 
 
Dragon Crystal is a dungeon crawler with RPG elements, along the lines of classics such as Rogue or 
Nethack. Without relying on a story, the game throws you into a randomly generated world which you 
should explore carefully - and most importantly, where you must survive! The complex, maze-like 
levels reveal their structure only after you cover the corresponding map areas. Your goal in each 
level is to reach a teleporter which will take you to the next one. There are also a lot of random 
items scattered around - weapons, armor, money, and food. Money allows you to continue the game if 
you die, food prevents you from starving. The enemies are visible on screen, and you fight them in a 
fast-paced turn-based combat, moving around and pressing direction arrows to strike with the equipped 
weapon. You are always accompanied by an egg which will eventually grow up to be a dragon if you have 
leveled up enough.

Rather than the traditional power-ups, Dynamite Headdy enables you to swap your head for different 
kinds – such as heads that heal you or heads that stick on to walls. You use your head in order to 
climb up on platforms as well, as you can grab hold of things with it, and on certain stages of the 
Mega Drive/Genesis version it is used to turn the game into a side-scrolling shooter, as you gain a 
propeller, jet, or bird head. Basically, Dynamite Headdy is just a traditional platformer at heart.

Evander Holyfield's 'Real Deal' Boxing (c) 1992 Novotrade International, Inc. / SEGA of America, Inc. 
 
Evander Holyfield's "Real Deal" Boxing is a boxing simulation.  Holyfield is the only licensed boxer, 
the rest are fictitious. Rather than a fanciful approach like Mike Tyson's Punch-Out!!, the 
developers went for a more strategic sim. Differently from its Genesis counterpart, the game is 
played from a first or third person point of view, with the fighters facing each other directly. The 
player can choose to see the fight from his or from the opponent's point of view ("through his 
eyes"). 
 
Players can either play a quick exhibition match or fight their way through the Career mode, using a 
created boxer to work their way up the 15-boxer ranking list until they fight Holyfield himself. 
During character creation, players can choose the fighter's head, color of skin, trunks and hair, 
physical and mental attributes. The physical attributes are dominant hand, power, speed, recovery and 
stamina. The mental attributes are style (brawler, dancer, boxer and dodger), killer instinct (low, 
medium or high) and favorite punches (jabs, straights or hooks aimed at head or torso, one for each 
hand). Between matches, career mode offers various exercises to assign the boxer to improve his 
stats. 
 
The players can choose the view mode (normal or reverse), three kinds of control schemes, round 
length (up to four minutes) and fight length (up to 12 rounds).

starts, the game tells you how many people are waiting in line and what product they are waiting for. 
Rounds one and three are played in “Switch Mode”: step on different switches to rotate associated 
sections of the conveyor belt. If you get off the switch, the section rotates back to its initial 
position. One switch may affect more than one section. Since you can only step on one switch at a 
time, you have to bustle quite a bit in later stages. Rounds two and four are played in “Bridge 
Mode”: remove and install small bridges between the belts to control the flow of products. 
 
If a person gets an unwanted product, the time remaining on the timer will decrease. Sometimes, the 
belt carries special items, e.g. a megaphone that makes your scream attack more powerful, or a weight 
that can be placed on a switch.

Fantastic Dizzy (c) 1993 Chameleon / Codemasters Software Company Limited, The 
 
The evil wizard Zaks has cast a spell on the peaceful Yolkfolk, and while many fell under his spell, 
others have other problems to deal with, including Dizzy, who saw his girlfriend Daisy kidnapped and 
taken hostage by Zaks, and it's up to him to restore the Yolkfolk to normal and rescue Daisy from the 
top of the Cloud Castle's tower. 
 
The most technically-advanced of Dizzy's adventure games in many ways, it was the only one to feature 
actual scrolling rather than a flick-screen system, the only one not to be released for the 8 bit 
computers the character originated on, the only one to originate on a console, as well as featuring 
many mini-games, such as Bubble Dizzy and an Operation Wolf clone. 
 
Gameplay involves walking Dizzy through the levels, picking up objects and using them to solve simple 
puzzles. There are plenty of tests of arcade skill along the way as well, as gaps must be jumped and 
baddies avoided - starting with a limited number of lives, the player can earn more by completing 
Theodore's puzzle. Before rescuing Daisy the player must capture all stars that unlock the gates of 
the tower.

FIFA International Soccer (c) 1994 Extended Play Productions / Electronic Arts, Inc. 
 
The game that started the best-selling series licensed by football's world governing body, this first 
installment in the long running series used a dimetric (colloquially known as "isometric") viewpoint, 
previously unusual in football games but quickly imitated by several titles. The televisual 
presentation, one of the unique points of the early EA Sports titles, with hosts introducing the 
matches, was another thing making the game stand out from a market dominated by Sensible Soccer and 
Kick Off games. 
 
Based on international teams (with fictional player names), their abilities in each skill area rated 
out of 10 to give the player an overall impression of how good they are. The options available follow 
the standard set: fouls and offsides can be toggled on and off, the match length can be set, and if 
the timer operates  continuously, or only while the ball is in play. Gameplay privileges quick runs, 
short passes and blistering shots outside the penalty box, and set pieces are controlled by moving a 
box into the target area for the ball, and then passed, lobbed or kicked directly. On the tactical 
side, formations can be selected, with 5 different strategies also available (although not all of 
these combinations make sense) as can the team Coverage - the areas which defenders, midfielders and 
strikers cover.

FIFA Soccer 96 (c) 1995 Probe Entertainment Ltd. / THQ Inc. 
 
"Aiming to be the first football simulation that is realistic in the true sense of the word, FIFA 
Soccer 96 was extremely popular at the time of release. It was hailed as the first really successful 
FIFA release, and opened the way for yearly revisions of the concept. 
 
There were a number of factors that made FIFA96 stand out from the crowd of other football sims. 
Firstly, the game's commentary was revolutionary at the time -- the renowned British commentator John 
Motson comments all the incidents and happenings on the pitch in real-time. The ambient commentary is 
varied, and systems with more than the minimum memory level get extra commentary phrases. 
 
The Virtual Stadium technology has numerous pre-defined camera angles. The game even has a SVGA mode 
for better-than-minimum system 
 
FIFA96 boasts eleven leagues from all around the world, ranging from the unknown players of the 
Malaysian league to the celebrated stars of the English and Italian leagues. 59 International teams 
are also featured, and it's possible to match the teams you want to against each other through 
friendlies, or you can also choose to play domestic tournaments or International ones such as the 
World Cup. If you're not satisfied with the composition of the various teams, you can create your own 
dream team through the custom team creator.

as well as an automatic switch option. 
 
You can play simple exhibition matches or tournaments, or launch into a career mode. In this you 
start at the bottom of the world rankings, and must reach the top by beating the game's players, who 
other than George are all fictitious boxers with varying strengths and weaknesses. The coach gives 
advice before each fight to help highlight weaknesses in your play. There are passwords for each

Formula One (c) 1993 Lankhor / Domark Software, Inc. 
 
F1 is an Official Formula One Racing Game. There are two modes of play available: "Arcade", "Grand 
Prix". In both of these modes you complete a certain number of laps (4, 8, or 12) and select which 
circuit that you want to race on. The circuits include San Marino, France, Britain, Germany, Italy, 
Portugal, Japan, and Australia. Some circuits are easy, while some are difficult. 
 
There are slight differences between the two modes. For instance, "Arcade" allows you to select the 
circuit in any order that you like, whereas "Grand Prix" only allows you to fine-tune your car before 
starting a race. You also need to race a circuit in the order that they appear on the circuit 
selection screen, but you can skip a track if you want. 
 
F1 is a 1-2 player game, meaning that if you have another player handy, you can compete against each 
other.

Galaga '90 (c) Oct 25, 1991 Namco Limited / Namco Limited 
 
Galaga '90 is a port of the arcade game Galaga '88. 
 
Galaga '90 takes the basic gameplay of Galaga and adds nicer graphics, triple ship abilities, parsec 
progression, power-ups, asteroids, bosses and other enhancements. 
 
Periodically the player encounters Challenging Stages, which are set to music and feature "dancing" 
enemies.  The objective is to shoot all 40 enemies before they disappear, for a bonus of at least 
10,000 points. 
 
There are a total of 29 stages.  You can begin with 1 ship with 2 in reserve or start right out with 
a dual ship (but only one in reserve). 
 
Some enemies now have the ability to combine into a much larger single enemy that takes multiple 
shots to destroy. 
Some enemies explode in a brilliant shower of fireworks when destroyed, and occasionally these 
enemies drop a small formation of much smaller enemies that "wiggle" their way down the screen.  Some 
enemies arrive in spherical "eggs" and emit a loud, high-pitched noise when hit. These creatures take 
multiple hits to destroy in flight (just one hit in formation), and their main attack pattern is to 
move about halfway down the screen, stop, fire multiple shots at once, and then fly straight down off 
the bottom of the screen.  Another type of enemy takes at least five hits to destroy, and it grows 
larger with each consecutive hit, making it both a larger target and allowing it to act as a shield 
to other enemies. 
 
Later in the game some enemies are equipped with armor that renders them invincible while in 
formation. When one of these enemies starts its dive, it will flip over and expose its vulnerable 
side, then flip over again and become invincible while it moves back up the screen, then flip one 
more time and finish its dive. While vulnerable, this enemy can be destroyed in one hit, scoring 
bonus points. 
 
In addition, many different kinds of obstacles appear throughout the game, including blue crystals, 
boulders and green blobs.

This top-down puzzle game starts with a screen featuring a number of red cogs at different parts of 
the screen, and a grid of pegs (which become less complete on later levels). Your task on each level 
is to use a number of gears of one of 3 different sizes to ensure that all the pegs are linked 
together. All this has to be completed before the engine overheats. 
 
Making life harder are two creatures with the peculiar name ‘Poffins’. One of these goes around 
removing pegs, and the other causes the engine to overheat further. They can be shot out of the way, 
or have gears placed over them to stop them. 
 
There’s also a bonus round, which is a fruit machine, only with cogs and other things from the game 
rather than fruit.

George Foreman's KO Boxing (c) 1992 SIMS Co., Ltd. / Flying Edge, Inc. 
 
The Master System and Game Gear versions of George Foreman's KO Boxing are fairly identical to the 
other versions in concept, but there are a few notable changes. The game is a reworking of the Master 
System title James 'Buster' Douglas Knockout Boxing, not to be confused with the Genesis title with 
the same name, which is entirely different. 
 
Just like the other versions players are cast as George Foreman to go through a series of boxing 
matches against different opponents to win the championship title belt. Compared to the other titles, 
these versions have new opponents and show the boxers from the side. Players can move left or right 
in the ring to avoid punches. Other moves including blocking, and left and right punches that can be 
varied into jabs and crosses. Matches can last up to ten rounds and when no regular or technical 
knock-out occurs, the winner is based on the jury's points, provided between the rounds. During 
knock-out phases, no buttons need to be pressed to get the boxer back to his feet. At the start of 
the game, a slow or fast speed for the gameplay can be selected. 
 
Each match the player's boxer can use three super punches. These need to be charged and then 
unleashed when near an opponent. It sends them straight to the back of the ring, a dangerous area as 
it is easy to keep punching them into the ropes. Health is slightly restored during the intermission 
and after each won match the player is awarded skill points to be distributed over three 
characteristics. Matches for two players are supported.

In the first installment of the Aleste series for the GG, you play as Ellinor Waisen, the daughter of

As usual, your task is to exterminate level upon level of nasties with your space ship. The usual 
Aleste powerup systems remains fairly intact. You still have powerup pods which release P capsules 
for upgrading your main weapon. On the other hand, secondary weapon upgrades are no longer released 
from ground bases, but from another type of flying pods. When you start out, your secondary weapon is 
a laser, which can later be replaced with powerups ranging from split fire to napalm rockets and 
target seeking power balls. Both primary and secondary weapons are in constant use, since only button 
2 is used for firing both weapons at once. Due to the smaller screen estate of the Game Gear, the 
sprites are larger and the playfield more constrained, for which the game compensates somewhat by 
introducing multidirectionally scrolling sections.

The Citizens Defence Force does not trust the United Nations to keep a troubled 21st century world at 
peace. It confiscates a horde of planes and warships, and as a UN loyalist, it is your job to shoot 
them down. Solving starvation and disease can wait, apparently. 
 
The game is split into 8 stages, which are split into sub-stages over land and sea, each of which has 
a strict time limit, and a target number of planes to shoot down. They take place from behind your 
plane, which can be controlled with ‘up’ referring to ‘climb’ or ‘dive’, depending on player 
preference. You are armed with 10 missiles as well as standard weapons. The plane can survive a few 
hits, so watch the damage report as it goes from red to black. 
 
Fail to complete a section in the time limit and you use up a continue, but the amount of planes 
previously shot down is not reset, making the second attempt easier Chase HQ style. As you destroy 
enemies you gain access to better planes, and the rank reported at the end of the game improves – 
this is also dependent on the skill level you play at.

Head Buster (c) Mar 15, 1991 NCS Corporation|Winds Co., Ltd. / Masaya 
 
Head Buster is a so-called ”future sports” game about robots. On a top-down, horizontally scrolling 
playfield, armed robots are moved around in a manner similar to Super Robot Taisen strategy games, 
albeit without many of the refinements of that series. 
 
Each game starts at the shop, where robots on your team are bought and equipped according to your 
tastes and finances. After that, the game begins in the robot arena, blue team against red team in 
one corner each. The goal is not explicitly to destroy the robots of the opposing team, but to 
destroy their base. In order to reach their base, and to prevent them from reaching yours, a certain 
amount of fighting is required. Each turn is split into a movement phase and a combat phase, and 
since actions of both sides are only executed when a phase is over, you cannot know when moving how 
close you will get to your opponents. 
 
Robots are available in three basic classes, from light to heavy, but can be modified with new 
movement units (different terrain squares have different movement properties), better armour and new 
weapons. Different weapons have both different strength and different ranges, as well as a limited 
supply of bullets. Reloading is done during the combat phase, but requires that your robot stays out 
of combat during that turn. Different sensors and command units can also be added, giving the robots 
better aim or particular abilities such as dodging, shielding and healing.

Home Alone (c) 1992 Brian A. Rice, Inc. / SEGA of America, Inc. 
 
Macaulay Culkin briefly became a child star following the film Home Alone, in which he played Kevin 
McCallister, who is accidentally left behind by his family when they go off on holiday. During this 
time, burglars attempt to break in, and Kevin must foil them. 
 
Playing as Kevin, you start off on his trusty sled, but the main job is to get to the house and make 
it burglar-proof. This involves setting traps throughout the house. Useful objects such as a 
Crossbow, Wire and Pepper can be combined to make fiendish weaponry. You must also lock up any 
valuables you find, to avoid the family losing them.

Hook (c) 1992 Ukiyotei Company, Ltd. / Sony Imagesoft 
 
In this video game adaption of the Steven Spielberg film Hook, the player takes the role of a 
grown-up Peter Pan, whose kids have been kidnapped by Captain Hook. Tinker Bell takes Peter back to 
Neverland where he must again become Pan and reclaim his children. 
 
This particular interpretation is a side-scrolling action game, in which players must hack their way 
past Hook's denizens through 11 levels.  These include forests, icy regions, and towns which Peter 
will have to jump, climb, and swim through. Magic items such as apples and pixie dust can be 
collected for special powers. When enemies are attacked, they simply put their hands up in surrender 
rather than dying, so as to make the game more child-friendly.

Incredible Crash Dummies, The (c) Sep 30, 1994 Software Creations Ltd. / Acclaim Entertainment, Inc. 
 
At a time when computer games were being blamed for violence, bad language, epilepsy and everything 
else the ‘moral majority’ needed a scapegoat for, Virgin gave us: The Road Safety Game. Or not, as 
this is a standard platform game with a twist of questionable taste and purpose. 
 
You play a crash test dummy, trying to progress through levels filled with hazards such as cars and 
fireballs, within the time limits. Contact with each of these loses you a limb, and once you have 
none left, contact means game over. Since the character isn’t handicapped by missing limbs in any 
way, in practical terms you can think of these as hit points  especially as there are screwdrivers to 
pick up which restore one limb.

As in the movie (and the more famous graphic adventure), your task is to find the Holy Grail. Before 
this can be done you must find the Cross of Coronado, a shield and a diary. 
 
This makes for a four-level arcade adventure combining climbs, exploration (with several routes 
through each level, and some traps) and puzzles. Indy is armed with his trusty whip to fight off 
foes, but can also get involved in hand-to-hand combat. The first level takes place in caves 
underneath Colorado, before you reach a moving circus train strewn with traps, a Zeppelin which is 
full of guards and ladders, and then Castle Grunwald in Austria.

They fight! and fight! and fight, and fight, and fight!... Itchy & Scratchy, from The Simpsons, are a 
cat and mouse cartoon duo. Itchy the mouse and Scratchy the cat exist only to find new and creative 
ways to attack and kill one another. As the latest cartoon adventures appear on the television, the 
violence spreads to brand new places. 
 
Itchy & Scratchy is a single player platform side-scroller. The player controls Itchy, the mouse, and 
must defeat Scratchy, the cat, with a variety of weapons. Itchy caries a default mallet, but can pick 
up additional weapons on particular levels. Each of the seven levels takes place in a different 
fictional location and is designed as a maze of doors and platforms. After defeating Scratchy, he 
usually will return with a special contraption to attack Itchy, and must therefore be defeated again.

Successful races bring more money, which can be used to soup up their machine. Boosts to top speed, 
grip and acceleration can be purchased, and your nitro boost must be kept topped up. If you are 
desperate for upgrades, you can buy into your spare credits 
 
Only your off-road driving abilities will be enough to pull you to first place in these races. Play

with an Inspector Gadget-style stretch device, which he can use to view higher areas or claw onto 
ceilings so as to slide across them. 
 
The gameplay takes place across worlds themed around particular types of toys, such as sporting 
goods, candy and aircraft. The levels scroll sideways, although a small amount of vertical movement 
is included. On each level Pond must collect 2 penguins and reach the exit, although there are 
usually multiple exits and lots of secret areas to explore. After completing each pair of two worlds 
(each of which has three sub levels), a boss must be faced.

Judge Dredd is a platform action game based on the British comic book character of the same name and

console jump/shoot/duck formula although it does add some unique twists such as wounding enemies so 
that they surrender and can be arrested. 
 
The initial levels follow the plot of the movie with futuristic lawman Judge Dredd framed and sent to 
the Aspen penal colony from which he must escape and prove his innocence.  Following the fight at the 
top of the Statue of Liberty that ended the film, the game continues on with levels and characters 
inspired by the comic book culminating with a battle against the Dark Judges on Deadworld.

One of many games based on the 1993 blockbuster Jurassic Park, the version for Sega's 8-bit systems 
combines side-scrolling shooting action and platforming levels. 
 
In each of the five stages of the game, one escaped dinosaur species must be recaptured. Each level 
begins with a side-scrolling driving section. Dinosaurs attack the car and must be fend off by firing 
at them with a crosshair. If the player survives long enough, a boss battle against an especially 
powerful dinosaur follows. 
 
After the completion of the driving section the level continues with a platform section. The player 
must jump, duck and climb to survive moving lifts, floors that will crumble under his feet, 
environmental hazards like acid drops, steam leaks or giant boulders and more. Dinosaurs will of 
course also stand in the way, but can be defeated by using several weapons: a rifle, a grenade 
launcher and hand grenades. Navigating the often maze-like levels will lead to the dinosaur that must 
be captured and a corresponding boss fight. 
 
The first four levels (featuring a Velociraptor, Pteranodon, Triceratops and Brachiosaurus) can be 
tackled in any order, but the final level, featuring the Tyrannosaurus Rex, is only unlocked when the 
others have been completed.

Kinetic Connection (c) Mar 29, 1991 
 
The Game Gear version of Kinetic Connection has been rearranged a lot from the original version

As the original version, Kinetic Connection is a jigsaw puzzle game, where the pieces are animated. 
This makes putting the pieces together to form the overall picture both more interesting and more 
difficult, since the player can not analyse each piece at his own pace when the entire puzzle is 
moving about. Pieces also need to be flipped around both on the X and Y axis in order to fit 
together. 
 
The game has 7 puzzles, some of which are carried over from the earlier versions but mostly new ones 
designed with Sega characters. Due to the small screen, the pieces are not kept in a box at the 
bottom of the screen as in the original Kinetic

Once upon a mouse, there was a kingdom that was ruled by the selfish king Pete. One day, a terrible 
shadow crept over the kingdom, threatening the lives of its inhabitants. The king's adviser said the

Your task is to rescue the Lemmings across 120 levels of fast-paced puzzling. These creatures simply 
walk blindly through the world in the hope of reaching safety at the end of the level - unfortunately 
these levels include steep drops, gaps in the ground, barriers and rivers amongst other hazards. 
 
You are in control not of any individual Lemming, but of a cross-hair, which can be moved over any of 
the Lemmings. Along the bottom are a selection of functions which can be assigned to a Lemming, 
including climbing, floating and bashing. You must click to select the appropriate function, then 
click on the Lemming to activate it. Each level has a different range of skills on offer, a different 
amount of Lemmings, and a different percentage target in order to progress.

Madou Monogatari A - Doki Doki - Bake Shon (c) Nov 24, 1995 Compile / Compile 
 
The story of Mado Monogatari A takes place at a time between  Mado Monogatari I and  Mado Monogatari 
II. Arle, the heroine of the series, is a little girl who studies magic. One day, she goes into a 
forest, only to notice that something terrible happened to it and its inhabitants, the fairies. Is 
this the work of the archenemy, Satan-sama? That's what Arle has to find out! 
 
Like most other Mado Monogatari games, it takes place in 3D maze-like dungeons, which you should 
explore, find treasures, and fight enemies. The turn-based, random battles are viewed from the same 
first-person perspective as the dungeon exploration. You fight using a variety of magic spells.

Mado Monogatari I is a puzzle/RPG mixture. Featuring characters and puzzles from Puyo Puyo games, it 
is set in a 3D dungeon which you explore from first-person perspective. Combat takes place on a 
platform, and is a mixture of turn-based and real time styles. Enemies attack you even if you wait, 
but you have time to perform your moves. You should hold down buttons and press direction arrows to 
execute various magic spells.

Eleven years have passed since Arle Nadja, magician girl extraordinaire, has defeated the evil as 
part of her examination in the magical school. Now she is sixteen and she can still remember the 
spells she has learned long time ago. One day she meets a fresh young man who without any apparent 
reason casts a powerful spell on her. Arle finds herself locked in a prison cell. Grabbing the key, 
she runs out of the cell, only to find out she is imprisoned in a huge dungeon populated by vicious 
monsters... 
 
Mado Monogatari II retains the gameplay system of the previous game. You navigate Arle through 
first-person 3D dungeons. Enemy encounters are random. During the turn-based battles, you can attack 
only with various types of magic. Since you don't see your own hit points, the key to winning the 
battles is to choose appropriate spells against various types of monsters.

You play as the young magician Arle Nadja. One day Arle goes out for a walk and meets a mysterious 
woman. The woman tells her that she will avenge the death of Satan, whom Arle has defeated in the end 
of her first adventure. The woman then summons the awful monster Minotaur. Arle has no choice but to 
run away, and she falls down through a trap into a dungeon. It appears she is now alone there, 
because the first creature she meets in this dungeon is a frosh king. He asks Arle to use her magical 
powers to defeat the monsters in the dungeon and to find a way to escape from Minotaur and the 
mysterious woman. 
 
The gameplay of Mado Monogatari III is similar to the two previous games. The entire game is viewed 
from first person perspective. You navigate Arle through maze-like 3D dungeons, encountering randomly 
appearing monsters and fighting them in turn-based combat. In battles you can't attack physically, 
only use various kinds of magic or items.

One night, as Mickey (or Minnie) lay in bed reading a book of fairy tales, he started to wonder how 
it would be to live in a far off land, in a magic castle. As he fell asleep, he woke up in the 
Kingdom of Beanwick, which is constantly tormented by earthquakes. Then, he offers his help to solve 
the mystery behind those earthquakes. 
 
Mickey's Ultimate Challenge is a puzzle game in which the player chooses either Mickey or Minnie to 
play with. They'll find five characters from the Disney's universe in the kingdom, and will be 
prompted to help them in several tasks. 
 
Each task is a different puzzle, given by a specific character. Daisy, for instance, will ask help to 
clean the castle's paintings hanging on a wall. The task is in fact a memory game, where Mickey or 
Minnie must clean the pictures matching pairs. After completing one task, they'll receive a gift. 
 
After completing all tasks, Mickey or Minnie must trade the gifts they won with the right characters. 
For instance, after finishing Goofy's task, they will receive his hammer. The player must then guess 
who among the other characters would like to receive that hammer. 
 
Giving the right items to the right characters will allow Mickey or Minnie access to the last puzzle 
and character.

Micro Machines (c) 1993 Codemasters Software Company Limited, The / Codemasters Software Company 
Limited, The 
 
If you're bored of racing Formula 1 cars, rally cars or MotoGP bikes in their natural habitats, the 
Micro Machines series could be for you. It involves racing miniatures representing particular vehicle 
types across a particular terrain found around the house. The Sports Cars race on the desktop, 4x4s 
in the sandpit, Formula 1 cars on a snooker table, and so on. 
 
These levels were packed with variation. The Snooker tables has the track painted on, although this 
is open to deviation (as are most levels), and had you racing through the pockets and across the rim 
of the table. Tanks raced as well, with the chance of shooting out your opponent if they got directly 
in front of you. The desktop levels include binders to jump across, pencil-sharpeners to avoid, and 
lots of visual jokes in the open homework. 
 
Viewed from overhead with small graphics, the races include up to 4 cars. In one player challenge 
mode you race through the 21 tracks in a set order, selecting your 3 opponents as you go along 
(adding a fair amount of strategy - ideally you should aim to eliminate the better CPU cars early 
on), eliminating one after every third race (assuming that you can finish in the top 2 of a race 
within your 3 lives). If you win 3 races in a row without using a continue you get a time-trial race 
which can earn you an extra life. 
 
The real innovation of the game was in the multiplayer modes. You started with 4 points each, and 
when one car gets far enough ahead to force the other car off-screen, the slider moves in their 
favour. Once it reached the end (which involved beating them 4 times more than they beat you) you win 
the level, although if 3 laps were completed, the person leading at that point is declared the winner 
- with a sudden death play off if scores are level. 9 of the tracks are available in this mode, 
although you can also play this Head to Head system as a 1-player game across all the tracks.

conquered by evil and fall into darkness, Shang entered Goro in the tournament and had him defeat the 
great Kung Lao. Goro has been  reigning supreme as the undefeated fighting champion for five hundred 
years now. As the last tournament required draws near, Raiden, Thunder God and protector of the Earth 
Realm, enacts a plan to tip the scales in the humans favor, Seven fighters step into the arena on 
Shang Tsung's mysterious island: Shaolin warrior Liu Kang, Special Forces operative Sonya Blade, the 
mercenary thug Kano, fame-seeking actor Johnny Cage, the ice wielding Lin Kuei warrior Sub-Zero and 
his undead adversary Scorpion, and Raiden himself. 
 
Mortal Kombat is a side-scrolling 1 on 1 fighting game. Fighting is set as one on one kombat, 
allowing each player to perform a variety of punches, kicks, and special moves in order to defeat 
their opponent.  When the opponent faces their second round loss, the winner can perform a finishing 
move called a "Fatality" on the loser.  The Fatality is a move unique to each fighter that 
graphically kills the loser in a blood-soaked finale. 
 
Mortal Kombat began its life as a 2-player arcade title. It is notable for its use of digitized 
actors to represent the game's fighters, as well as its use of copious amounts of blood during 
gameplay.

Mortal Kombat 3 (c) 1995 Midway Games, Inc. / Tec Toy Indústria de Brinquedos S.A. 
 
Shao Kahn has won. The Earthrealm is no more. In order to revive his Queen Sindel, the emperor Shao 
Kahn used the Outworld Tournament from Mortal Kombat 2 as a diversion while his Shadow Priests revive 
his fallen Queen on Earth. Once enacted, the dimensional bridge between the two realms connects, 
allowing Kahn's extermination squads to invade and destroy Earth, and enslave the population's souls. 
 
A small team of Raiden's "Chosen Warriors" survives the attack: Mortal Kombat champion Liu Kang and 
his ally Kung Lao, Special Forces agents Sonya Blade and Jax, the shaman Nightwolf, the riot cop 
Stryker, the nomadic Kabal, and former Lin Kuei warrior Sub-Zero, who has gone rogue from his clan. 
Facing the warriors are the mercenary Kano, cyber-ninjas Smoke, Sektor and Cyrax, Sheeva, a female 
Shokan, the sorcerer Shang Tsung, and Queen Sindel herself. 
 
Mortal Kombat 3 brings new elements to the 2D fighting series: multi-level playfields, "Dial-A-Combo" 
attacks, a "Run" button to speed up the battles, and "Vs." codes, which unlock new powers and 
abilities once both players enter a code sequence in pre-match-up screens. Also included are more 
stage fatalities and finishing moves as each warrior attempts to go one-on-one with the Centaurian 
enforcer Motaro, and Shao Kahn himself. 
 
Mortal Kombat 3 is the last traditional one-on-one fighting game game in the series to feature 
motion-captured digitized graphics for its kombatants, and introduces online network play to the PC 
version.

Mortal Kombat II (c) 1994 Midway Games, Inc. / Acclaim Entertainment, Inc. 
 
The Mortal Kombat fighters, plus several new ones, return for a tournament held by the evil Shang 
Tsung of the Outworld. The action is one-on-one as before, and famed for its high level of violence 
and blood (other than the sanitised Nintendo version). There are 5 difficulty levels and optional 
credits, as well as the usual two player mode including same character duels. 
 
To win the main tournament, the player must beat each of the other human players, before taking on 
Shang Tsung, Kintaro and finally Shao Kahn. Players have a range of punches and kicks available, as 
well as flying kicks, uppercuts, roundhouses, and the special moves, which vary for each player. 
These include throws, uppercuts, long-distance bullets, bicycle kicks and a teleport feature.

Ms. Pac-Man (c) 1995 General Computer Corporation|Midway / Namco Hometek Inc. 
 
In 1982, a sequel to the  incredibly popular Pac-Man was introduced in the form of his girlfriend, 
Ms. Pac-Man.  This sequel continued on the "eat the dots/avoid the ghosts" gameplay of the original 
game, but added new features to keep the title fresh. 
 
Like her boyfriend, Ms. Pac-Man attempts to clear four various and challenging mazes filled with dots 
and ever-moving bouncing fruit  while avoiding Inky, Blinky, Pinky and Sue, each with their own 
personalities and tactics.  One touch from any of these ghosts means a loss of life for Ms. Pac-Man. 
 
Ms. Pac-Man can turn the tables on her pursuers by eating one of the four Energizers located 
    within the maze. During this time, the ghosts turn blue, and Ms. Pac-Man can eat them for bonus 
    points (ranging from 200, 400, 800 and 1600, progressively). The Energizer power only lasts for a 
    limited amount of time, as the ghost's eyes float back to their center box, and regenerate to 
    chase after Ms. Pac-Man again. 
 
Survive a few rounds of gameplay, and the player will be treated to humorous intermissions showing 
the growing romantic relationship between Pac-Man and Ms. Pac-Man, leading all the way up to the 
arrival of "Junior".

Nazo Puyo (c) Jul 23, 1993 Compile / SEGA Enterprises Ltd. 
 
Nazo Puyo (Secret Puyo) takes the "Quest mode" found in many Puyo Puyo games and breaks it off into a 
game of its own. Whereas the usual Puyo Puyo gameplay is centred around beating an opponent by having 
a more skillful play technique, the puzzle mode (and all Nazo Puyo) games is a leisurly puzzle game 
where you have to fulfill a set goal on a screen already filled with a certain arrangement of Puyos. 
 
These goals may be to simply eliminate all Puyos on-screen, to eliminate all Puyos of a certain 
colour, or to eliminate a certain number of Puyos at once. You may also be asked to do a "rensa", or 
chain reaction, in a certain number of steps. A "rensa" is arranged by making so that if one set of 
four or more Puyos is eliminated, it will make neighbouring Puyos fall so that new combinations 
arise, and are eliminated. The fulfillment of the goals may be complicated by the fact that you are 
given only Puyos of a certain colour to work with. 
 
The game has also an edit mode, where you can make your own puzzles given all the options described 
above.

triple combo" and so on, thereby taxing your Puyo Puyo skills and strategies. 
 
Another new addition is a battery backup, allowing you not only to save your current position, but

Nazo Puyo Aruru no Ru (c) Jul 29, 1994 Compile / SEGA Enterprises Ltd. 
 
One day, Arle (Aruru), the cute girl who is also the protagonist of the Puyo Puyo and Mado Monogatari 
games, decides that she shall have curry rice for dinner. She heads for the market, but all the 
market stalls are run by the usual crowd of baddies from Puyo Puyo. And they won't take cash! 
Instead, before they give her the necessary ingredients, she must solve the Puyo puzzles they have on 
offer. 
 
The game starts out as a normal top-down RPG, where Arle can go from stand to stand and choose in 
which turn to clear the merchants' puzzles. The puzzles are played in the typical Nazo Puyo style, 
with a set field of existing Puyos which Arle must tackle given only a limited number of new Puyos. 
In order to clear a puzzle, Arle must fulfill a certain goal, such as clearing all Puyos of a certain 
colour, make chain reactions of a certain length, or eliminate only a certain number of Puyos (no 
more, no less). Luckily, she can see what Puyos are available for several drop in advance. If she 
fails to solve a puzzle, Arle can retry, but for each failure, she will lose health. Solving a puzzle 
makes her level up through the same system used in Mado Monogatari, with a ring of lights around the 
screen. Raising a level restores health. Will Arle ever be able to cook her curry? 
 
The game also contains a "Toko Puyo" mode, which is the endless mode known from most regular Puyo 
Puyo games.

This game lets you play two-on-two arcade basketball with players from all the NBA teams. Gameplay is 
fast and action-packed, with few rules, no fouls, and deliberately unrealistic jamming. Players are 
rated on eight ability categories, from steals and blocks, to dunks and 3-pointers. 
 
Up to four human players can take part, each always controlling a single player for their team, and 
AI for missing players. This allows for four players to face each other in teams of two, or for two 
players to team up against a third player with a CPU team-mate. 
 
The Tournament Edition ups each team's roster to three players, and allows for substitutions between 
quarters. Shoving players now results in injuries, which lower a player's stats

Olympic Gold - Barcelona '92 (c) 1992 Tiertex Ltd. / U.S. Gold Ltd. 
 
The official game of the Games of the XXV Olympiad, held in Barcelona in 1992, featuring seven 
different events: 100M Sprint, Hammer Throw, Archery, 110M Hurdles, Pole Vault, Springboard diving 
and 200M Freestyle Swimming. 
 
Gameplay features the typical button mashing formula used by Epyx during the 80s. 100M Sprint, 110M 
Hurdles and 200M Freestyle Swimming feature a button mashing sequence with just some changes: in the 
hurdles the player must hit the action key to jump over a hurdle (the timing sets the loss of speed) 
and in swimming, the sequence takes over one and an half minutes and the action button touches the 
edge for the return swim. In these events, the player initially faces a semi-final round and only 
qualifies for the final if ends in the top half. It's possible to watch the other semi-final. 
Hammer Throw combines a strong mashing sequence, along an accurate press of the action button to 
release the hammer, while Pole Vault combines an initial mashing sequence, a first tap on down to set 
the bar, then pressing up and the action button to release the pole and jump over the bar. Archery is 
a technical event where the player has three rounds with six arrows each, the winner being the one 
with the highest score on all three rounds. 
 
The player can choose to compete for eight nations: Great Britain, France, Germany, Italy, hosts 
Spain, United Stats, Japan and the CIS (formerly the Soviet Union). Each nation has it's own sample 
of the anthem and a set of athletes to compete against the player. Each athlete is unique, and will 
perform differently according the the event: in some they are capable of braking World Records, in 
others, lucky enough to get to a final or a top-6 spot. The competition is split in two tables: 
sorted by medals and by total score (the gold medalist gets 24 points, the 12th only 13).

Ottifants, The (c) 1993 Graftgold Ltd. / SEGA Enterprises Ltd. 
 
Bruno is a baby Ottifant. It's an ordinary evening, and Bruno's dad is working late at office. Reason 
enough for Bruno's vivid imagination to run riot, thinking that his dad has been kidnapped by aliens! 
Jelly babies, that fell from his father's pocket on the way to work, blaze a trail to the office. Now 
it's up to Bruno to fight his way through hordes of terrorizing toys, Ottifant-eating plants, tear 
through gloomy caverns of doom and cut across a perilous jungle - workaday objects and boringly 
normal settings as seen through kids' eyes - and rescue his dad! 
 
The Ottifants for the SEGA Game Gear is a 2D side-scrolling platformer where the player controls 
Bruno through five worlds: starting with the house and the basement, through to the building site, 
the office and finally the jungle, whereas each world is in turn divided into three stages. Bruno's 
primary weapon is his trunk, which gives him the ability to blast enemies by firing sweets at them, 
or suck in objects like out-of-reach platforms or boxes by holding down the Fire-button. Furthermore, 
yellow, green and red lollies are spread throughout the stages. Gathering three of them activate one 
of Bruno's special skills and can - depending on the colour combination - transform the baby Ottifant 
into Superfant with the ability to fly, boost his speed with Speedy Shoes, give an extra Continue and 
more. 
 
Picking up jelly babies, blasting enemies and collecting papers gives points and raises Bruno's score 
up to a fixed value of 9,999 pts. There are several entrances to secret rooms hidden in the five 
worlds. But, unlike the Genesis-version, the rooms are quite small and basic and there is no 1,000 
point reward by completing them. On the whole there are two different tunes backing your journey 
through the game: one for the stages and one for the boss enemies. The varied background music and 
sound effects of the Genesis-game are completely missing, as is one entire world: The Garden.

area (after you place him, of course), if he bumps against a block or a "wall" on the game area, he 
will change his direction. As with many block-dropping puzzlers, if a line of blocks and/or ghosts 
reaches the top, the game ends. However, by filling up a meter on the left of the game area, a fairy 
may appear that can clear approximately 6 or 7 lines with ghosts, but it only clears the ghosts, 
although the blocks that were on top of them will drop. 
 
Also, like many puzzlers, it contains a versus mode against another human player. It's similar to the 
many versus modes of puzzle games: eat plenty of ghosts and your opponent will recieve many ghosts on 
his area. 
 
The game also includes a Puzzle mode. It features 100 levels, in which you have to eat all ghosts 
with no more than 4 Pac-Men at least (the number reduces in certain levels), and, unlike the other 
modes, you can change Pac-Man's direction with the press of a button. 
 
All of the handheld versions (including the one on Pac-Man Collection) lack the versus mode.

Pac-Man (c) 1991 Namco Limited / Namco Limited 
 
One of the most popular and influential games of the 1980's, Pac-Man stars a little, yellow 
dot-muncher who works his way around to clear a maze of the various dots and fruit which inhabit the 
board. 
 
Pac-Man's goal is continually challenged by four ghosts: The shy blue ghost Bashful (Inky), the 
   trailing red ghost Shadow (Blinky), the fast pink ghost Speedy (Pinky), and the forgetful orange 
   ghost Pokey (Clyde).  One touch from any of these ghosts means a loss of life for Pac-Man. 
 
Pac-Man can turn the tables on his pursuers by eating of the four Energizers located within the 
   maze.  During this time, the ghosts turn blue, and Pac-Man can eat them for bonus points.  This 
   only lasts for a limited amount of time, as the ghost's eyes float back to their center box, and 
   regenerate to chase after Pac-Man again. 
 
Survive a few rounds of gameplay, and be treated to humorous intermissions between Pac-Man and the 
ghosts.

Panzer Dragoon Mini (c) 1996 SEGA Enterprises Ltd. / SEGA Enterprises Ltd. 
 
Panzer Dragoon Mini is the Japan-only 8-bit version of Sega's popular 32-bit rail shooter, but due to 
(massive) hardware limitations, the game has more in common with other classic Sega game, Space 
Harrier. Taking further away from the original games, there is no rider and the game lacks any 
plotline. 
The player starts by choosing one of three dragons, and from there must shoot at incoming enemies 
(although for most time, just avoiding incoming fire is an easier way to progress in the game). At 
the end of the level (each with two bosses), a password appears and allows the game to be resumed 
later.

PGA Tour Golf introduced many of the conventions commonly seen in the genre since. The three-click 
control method (the first to start the swing, the second setting power and over-swing, the third 
setting draw or fade) allowed for a multitude of different shots, and required a sense of timing. 
 
Four courses are included, one of them a fantasy 'links' course designed by the programmers. Some of 
the holes are fiendish, with bunkers, water hazards and trees, and the need to plan strategies to get 
the best approach to the green. 
 
When playing a tournament there are 60 opponents, each representing top US golfers - ten of these

You are an agent of Paseo on Motavia. One day, in December 1268 A.W, you received a letter at base. 
The sender was Ken Miller. He was a scientist as well as an old friend of yours. He had immigrated to 
Dezolis to conduct his research years ago.  These were the contents of the letter: "How are you?  I 
have succeeded in the discovery of the century. You must come and see it." 
 
You travel to the planet Dezolis and visit a town called Carsonville. There, you find out that Dr. 
Miller has invented a machine that can make human beings immensely powerful. The problem is, Dr. 
Miller is kidnapped, along with his invention. With the help of his sister Laila you have to solve 
this mystery. 
 
This game is a Japanese-style adventure game set in the Phantasy Star universe. You interact with the 
game world by choosing available options such as "See", "Talk", "Move", etc. There are a few puzzles 
to solve, but the largest part of the game is dedicated to exploration and dialogue with the 
characters.

Long ago, the evil Cablon ravaged the Copto planet, a light year away of the Algol system. When he 
was defeated, he was sealed on a planet discovered by Alis, the heroine of the first "Phantasy Star", 
a planet that was also known as Alisland. In this gaiden (side-story) set in Phantasy Star universe, 
you play the role of two young people from the village Tedo - Alec and Mina. One day, Mina finds an 
old artifact. While wondering what that could be, the young people learn that Alec' father was 
attacked and kidnapped by bandits. Determined to find him, the two heroes embark on a dangerous 
journey that will eventually lead them much further than they suspect. 
 
Phantasy Star Gaiden plays pretty much like any other Phantasy Star starting with the second game: 
both towns and dungeons are in top-down view, the turn-based battles are viewed from first-person 
perspective. The gameplay is standard console-style RPG: you should fight random enemies, gain 
experience and gold, buy better equipment, visit many towns and dungeons, etc.

Ren & Stimpy - Quest for the Shaven Yak, The (c) 1994 Realtime Associates, Inc. / SEGA of America, 
Inc. 
 
Ren and Stimpy just found a pair of hooves which belong to the great Shaven Yak, who lost them in the 
last Yak shaving day. Now they must find the Shaven Yak and return him his hooves, or there won't be 
any more Yak shaving days! 
 
In this platform game the player is prompted to choose playing either as Ren or Stimpy at the start 
of new life or some stages. Both can jump and shoot (Ren shoots toothbrushes, Stimpy spits), but each 
one has his own special ability: Ren can perform high jumps, Stimpy can smash things jumping over 
them. Each character starts the game with three lives. 
 
Throughout levels such as "The Blacker Than Black Forest", "The Stinking Dry Desert" or "The Stinking 
Wet Bayou", Ren and Stimpy will face most animal enemies, such as birds, frogs, vultures, 
woodpeckers, snakes, etc. The levels are divided in few or several sub-level, and at the end of each 
level, they'll face a boss. 
 
They'll also find some unusual weapons, as a slice of bread (which flies in circles), a remote 
controller (which casts electric waves) and a soap bar (which casts bubbles). If they get hit when 
using a weapon, they'll lose it, but won't lose health. They'll gain health by picking items like 
TVs, cash bags, bottles and boots.

There is only one mode of play available, a single-player exhibition where the player picks a team to

where there are four preset fighters to choose from along with an option to create customers boxers. 
The career starts out at position #25 in the ranking and players slowly work up the ladder, going to 
the gym in between bouts to build up stats to eventually take on "Big Daddy" himself, Riddick Bowe. 
 
The game is practically a copy of Evander Holyfield's Real Deal Boxing, save for the graphics style

Road Rash (c) 1994 Electronic Arts, Inc. / U.S. Gold Ltd. 
 
Road Rash is an aggressive motorcycle racing game where the player assumes the role of a biker who 
takes part in a series of illegal races across the U.S.A. Starting at the back of the pack the 
objective is always to finish first on a linear course, overtaking the other bikers. This is achieved 
by driving very well or by playing it dirty, knocking opponents of their bikes using clubs, crowbars 
or your bare hands. The other racers fight back in a similar fashion and there are also hazards. All 
the races take place on the regular road with normal traffic (in both directions) and the cops, as 
well as occasional oil slicks and stray cows. 
 
By winning races you can get promoted to a stronger division and earn cash with which you can buy a 
better bike. Whenever you're knocked off your bike or hit something you will have to run back to your 
bike and lose valuable time, plus your bike will suffer some damage. When the player crashes with 
cops nearby, it is possible to get busted and then you have to forfeit the race. 
 
Like the whole Road Rash lineage, the game has arcade-like gameplay with no intention to be a 
motorcycle simulation. While the game has a two-player mode, this is not simultaneous.

your opponent a clear goal-scoring opportunity) results in that player being sent off). The

casting spells. Once in contact with the enemy, a short automatic battle sequence occurs. You gain 
experience points for every attack. Unlike other Shining Force games, you cannot visit towns in this 
game.

Side Pocket (c) 1994 Data East Corporation / Data East USA, Inc. 
 
The main objective is to cross different USA cities and reach the predetermined scores to go ahead. 
But remember: you'll have only 16 balls and every error can be lethal! 
 
The game also comes with modes for 2 players with two variants: 2P Pocket Game (the traditional mode) 
and 2P 9-Ball Game, where the premise is to sink 9 balls before the other player makes them first. If 
you prefer, test your target in Trick Game or even hear your favorite song in Jukebox. 
 
After each stage completed (and some luck), a bonus stage will appear, as well as the chance to earn 
extra balls. You will only need a good target in the parquet block!

Simpsons, The - Bartman Meets Radioactive Man (c) 1993 Imagineering Inc. / Flying Edge, Inc. 
 
Bart Simpson is reading the latest comic about the Radioactive Man but his favourite superhero is not 
featured in it. When he is at the last page, his sidekick Fallout Boy appears. He tells Bart he is 
the only one who can save Radioactive Man who has been sent to the Limbo Zone, a mysterious prison 
that revolves around a black hole. Bart turns into Bartman and he has to fight three super villains 
to collect Radioactive Man's lost powers before facing the mastermind Brain-O the Magnificent. 
 
Players control Bartman through 2D side-scrolling platform levels. He needs to defeat enemies, 
collect goodies, and be careful not to fall into one of the deadly traps on his way. Bartman can 
punch and kick, and collect lightning icons to shoot small bolts. Most of the level sequences require 
precise timing and pixel-perfect jumping precision. Bartman has five life points that are restored by 
collecting radioactive signs.

Simpsons, The - Bart vs. The Space Mutants (c) 1992 Imagineering Inc. / Flying Edge, Inc. 
 
Bart vs. The Space Mutants is a platform game where the player goes into the role of Bart Simpson 
(from the TV show The Simpsons) and must stop the Space Mutants from invading Springfield. 
 
On each of the five levels, Bart must collect (or get rid of) the ingredients that the Space Mutants 
are planning to use to build their machine, such as purple objects or balloons. He also has to 
collect enough "proof" of the aliens existence (brown coins left behind when they are jumped on), so 
his family members will help him when he meets a boss (characters such as Nelson and Sideshow Bob). 
This won't be easy since the Space Mutants are "using" human bodies as disguise. In order to discover 
who are the real Space Mutants, Bart must use his X-ray Specs. 
 
The ways Bart can get rid of those objects sought by the Space Mutants are numerous. For instance, in 
the first stage, Bart must get rid of purple objects. He can dye them red, cover them, wash them, 
etc. Some even involve a little puzzle solving, like playing a trick on Moe to make him get out of 
the bar. 
 
Bart also has some coins that can be used in many ways throughout the game, like buying things, 
getting devices operating, etc. Those coins are essential to solve some puzzles in the game.

S.S. Lucifer - Man Overboard! (c) 1994 Odysseus Software / Codemasters 
 
Your name is Kevin Codner – rescue mariner extraordinaire, answering the distress call of a sinking 
cruise liner, the SS Lucifer. You set off in your little submarine and board the ship where a horde 
of passengers desperately need your keen oversight and "shipsmarts". 
 
In 60 levels you have to rescue as many passengers (dubbed the Dim Passengers) as possible. At the 
beginning the passengers fall through a tube in the level. Similar to Lemmings you have to find a way 
for the passengers to the exit of the level. In order to do so, you must blast hindrances such cargo 
boxes and bulkheads with bombs or, when no bombs are left, reposition the boxes with a crane. There 
are also conveyor belts in the levels. If the belt moves in the wrong way, the passengers either 
can't use it or may even be transported to their dooms, being dropped off into water, fire or steam 
jets. You can usually choose the direction of the belts by pulling a lever. 
 
There are several types of scenarios that Kevin Codner (you) are faced with throughout the game. Of 
course the puzzles get progressively more difficult, involving things like patching up cracked pipes 
to stop a lethal jet of steam from cooking the distressed passengers. You can blast away obstacles 
and stack crates in creative manners. For instance, you can have them fall onto each other to form a 
bridge across a gap or to provide shielding from fire. This is usually done by hoisting them onto 
conveyor belts using a crane. 
 
Each level has a certain "save limit", meaning you have to save at least a certain amount of 
passengers. This again is akin a bit towards Lemmings, and lots of levels have a built-in time limit, 
represented be water pouring into the compartment, rising ominously. When the water rises high 
enough, the passengers will get carried along with it, and they can only swim for a short period of 
time before getting exhausted and drowning, so you'd better be on time with some assistance. 
 
At the end of each level you receive a password (again, Lemmings-style) so that you may pick up your 
game from the current level without having to progress through them all from the get-go.

The Skweeks lived in harmony for centuries, being a naturally peaceful peoples, until Pitark arrived. 
He ruined their bright pink land by removing the colour, and it was only after he died that they had 
the opportunity to clean the land up. Your job is to travel through the 99 continents and clean each 
one in sequence. 
 
Skweek can move in each of the four compass directions, and is armed with a simple weapon, whose 
shots rebound around before they hit one of Pitark's minions, the Schnoreuls - contact with which is 
instantly fatal. Some squares contain arrows which force you in a particular direction, while there 
are also blockades to avoid. Bomb squares blow up surrounding squares but give you time to move away 
from them as they do this, while Shortcut squares allow you to move to another teleport-type square 
by pushing the joystick in its direction.

Super Smash T.V. (c) 1992 Williams Electronic Games, Inc. / Acclaim Entertainment, Inc. 
 
The year is 1999. The world's most popular television show is Smash T.V., an ultra-violent contest 
between two armed-to-the-teeth combatants, set loose in a series of deadly arenas that are filled to 
bursting with hordes of mindless beasts and killer robots. The aim of the game is to blast everything 
in sight and try to grab more cash and prizes than the other guy. Toaster ovens, VCRs, fancy cars and 
luxury holidays are there for the taking... for anyone who can survive long enough to enjoy them. 
 
Smash T.V. is an insane shoot-em-up from the brain of Eugene Jarvis, creator of Robotron: 2084. It 
retains that game's frantic style of play and two-joystick control method, but adds plenty of gore, 
violence, a hint of satire and that all-important two player mode.

Sonic Drift 2 is the sequel to Sonic Drift, also on the Game Gear and the first in the series to be 
released outside Japan. One of the new things in the sequel is a lag boost system, which means that 
anyone who is behind gets a boost to catch up again. This keeps the action in the game. Another new 
thing is that the gadgets touched while racing do not come into effect immediately. They need to be 
triggered manually by pressing up on the D-pad. 
 
There are 3 GPs to compete in and each GP has 6 tracks. The names of the GPs are: 
 
1. Purple Chaos GP 
2. White Chaos GP 
3. Blue Chaos GP 
 
Racing skills can be improved in the Free Run mode on any of the tracks, or, with a Gear-to-Gear 
cable and a spare copy of the game, direct competition against another human player in the versus

Sonic the Hedgehog (c) Dec, 1991 Ancient Co. Ltd. / SEGA of America, Inc. 
 
SEGA's mascot Sonic the Hedgehog made his debut in a famous Genesis title, but Sega's 8-bit systems 
got their own version of the platformer, featuring the same story and gameplay style, but different 
levels. 
 
To stop the evil Dr. Robotnik, Sonic must traverse six zones consisting of three levels each. Most of 
the zones are based on those in the original game, but some are entirely new. Enemies (mechanized 
animals, defeated by Sonic's spikes when jumping or rolling) and power-ups (speed-ups, shields, extra 
lives) are mostly the same as well. Sonic can pick up golden rings for protection (when hit, he 
simply loses all of his rings instead of a life) and bonuses: 100 rings gain Sonic an extra life, and 
50 remaining rings at the end of a level allow access to pinball-themed special stages full of 
bumpers and springs. The final level of a zone is always a boss fight against Robotnik. 
 
Sonic should also collect the six Chaos Emeralds to keep them from falling into Robotnik's hands. In 
a departure from the original game, these are not hidden in the special stages but somewhere in the 
regular levels.

Coming back from the vacation Sonic took after foiling the plans of Dr Robotnik, he finds that Tails 
and all his other animal friends are missing. Sonic finds a letter waiting for him, that reads: 
 
"Dear Sonic, 
 
Robotnik is back, and he's captured all the animals on the island! He is holding me in a place called 
the Crystal Egg. In order to free me, you have to find and bring the six Chaos Emeralds. 
 
Robotnik made me write this. He says he's waiting for you, and he's created six really nasty robots 
in order to 'get rid of you once and for all.' I don't know what he has planned, but Sonic, please be 
careful! 
 
Sincerely, Tails." 
 
That being more that enough motivation for him, Sonic races out to defeat Robotnik again. 
 
The master system version is totally different than the Sonic 2 for Genesis. Tails obviously doesn't 
accompany you, like he can in the Genesis release. Sonic can also not do his infamous buzzsaw roll by 
simply ducking and pressing jump.

Spider-Man - Return of the Sinister Six (c) 1992 B.I.T.S., Ltd. / Flying Edge, Inc. 
 
From the ingame intro: 
 
"Doctor Octopus is plotting the crowning caper of his criminal career... to rule the world. 
He has reunited the Sinister Six and with these super-villains together again, nothing stands in 
their way - except Spider-Man!" 
 
Spider-Man: Return of the Sinister Six is a side-scrolling game which puts you in the role of Spidey 
throughout six levels against Electro, Sandman, Mysterio, Vulture, Hobgoblin and Doctor Octopus 
respectively. Some puzzle solving (like finding a key) is necessary to beat some levels. Spidey can 
duck jump, climb walls, punch, shoot webs to swing (by pressing punch and jump together) and perform 
a jump kick (by pressing the punch button twice). Collecting web cartridges allows Spidey to shoot 
limited web projectiles. 
 
Although hard to die, Spidey has only one life, there are no items to recharge life (but killing some 
guys will do so) and only one continue.

Sports Trivia - Championship Edition (c) 1995 Adrenalin Entertainment / SEGA of America, Inc. 
 
Sports Trivia: Championship Edition is a mix of football and sports trivia.  The main premise of the 
game is set on a football field, choosing plays on either offense or defense they than are answered a 
series of sports-related trivia questions.  Answering more questions correctly in a certain amount of 
time will determine how well their quarterback will pass or how many yards their running back will 
gain.  Alternatively, the same applies to the defense where if a player answers more trivia questions 
correctly, the better the chance of a sack, interception, etc. 
 
There are eleven different sports categories that range from football, baseball, hockey and boxing 
clear up to college sports and even auto racing.  Each question is given in multiple choice format 
and players are allowed five audibles (an alternate question) for each half.  The player has the 
option of either competing against the computer A.I. or against a friend.

Stargate (c) May 26, 1995 Probe Software Ltd. / Acclaim Japan, Ltd. 
 
The handheld version of Stargate is a matching puzzle game, similar to a 3-D  Tetris. Players drop 
tiles into a Stargate, and try to stack three identical symbols. Doing so clears those tiles. 
Mismatched tiles simply build stacks higher and higher, and the player loses if the tiles reach the 
top of the gate. The player is also given a seven-symbol Stargate "address" along the top of the 
screen. Stacking three copies of a symbol listed in the address will clear the stack and counts 
toward completing the address. 
 
There are two game modes building on this basic concept: 
 
1. Skill Mode is a single-player challenge where the player tries to complete as many addresses as 
   they can before being overwhelmed. Speed increases with completed addresses. 
 
Battle Mode can be played against the computer, or against a second player connected with a link 
cable. In Battle Mode, any stacks you clear are sent through the Stargate and appear on your 
opponent's side. A height level meter is added on the sides to show how close you and your opponent 
are to overflowing their gates. You can win by outlasting your opponent (while sending complete 
stacks through to make things more difficult for them) or by being the first to complete the address.

Star Trek Generations - Beyond the Nexus (c) 1994 Absolute Entertainment, Inc. / Absolute 
Entertainment, Inc. 
 
Beyond the Nexus is based on the seventh Star Trek movie and its story: Captains Kirk and Picard must 
team up to stop a mad scientist from destroying an inhabited planet so that he might reenter the 
mysterious Nexus energy ribbon. 
 
The game has several different playing modes. The first is starship combat: seen from the main screen 
of the Enterprise (both the -B or the -D version) you navigate the ship through space, firing phasers 
or photon torpedoes at enemies like Tholians, Klingons and Romulans. Another mode has you navigating 
the ship to its destination by flying through rectangles in space. 
 
On away missions, the view switches to a top-down perspective where you control a single character 
and can fire your phaser at enemies. 
 
Finally, the game has two puzzle modes. In the first one, frequencies must be decoded: this is done 
by putting symbols into the right order. One can only guess the order at first, but after an attempt 
the game reveals how many of the selected symbols are part of the combination and how many are in the 
right place. Using logic, the right order can be determined, but there are only a limited number of 
tries. 
 
The second puzzle mode is used to reroute power from one system to another. To do so, a path must be 
built on a grid for the energy to flow through. The path must be built out of randomly assigned 
pieces that don't always fit together, similar to the concept of Pipe Mania.

Streets of Rage (c) 1992 SEGA Enterprises Ltd. / SEGA of America, Inc. 
 
Streets of Rage, Sega's answer to Final Fight, follows the story of three young police officers (Adam 
Hunter, Axel Stone and Blaze Fielding) in a city controlled by a criminal syndicate led by a "Mr. X" 
where crime is rampant, which leads the three heroes to make a pact to leave the force and topple the 
syndicate by themselves. 
 
Gameplay is straightforward and simple. Three buttons are used, one to jump, other to attack and 
another to perform a range attack from a support police car. Each character has a limited set of 
moves that include punching and kicking or performing a back attack (if in the open), two grapple 
moves (depending if holding the opponent in front or by the back), a flying attack, and if playing 
with another player two additional tag attacks, and different abilities: Adam is slow, but a good 
jumper and a hard hitter, Axel fast and also a hard hitter, but a lousy jumper and Blaze fast and a 
good jumper, but weak hitter. 
Levels are in typical arcade side-scroller fashion: move from left to right (with two exceptions), 
clearing screens from enemies one after another as fast as possible while avoid taking damage with a 
boss in the end. Some levels feature "death drops" where the player must avoid falling, while 
throwing enemies there at the same time, including a typical elevator level.  Several items are 
scattered on the ground, from melee weapons and bonus points (and lives or additional police cars) to 
apples and turkeys (to restore health).

Streets of Rage II (c) 1993 Ancient Co. Ltd.|MNM Software|Shout!Designworks Co., Ltd. / SEGA of

After Axel Stone, Blaze Fielding and Adam Hunter destroyed the evil Syndicate leader, Mr. X, the city 
became a peaceful place to live, and each one of them followed their own paths. One year later, after 
their reunion, Adam's brother Sammy returned from school to find their apartment in a mess, and Adam 
nowhere to be seen, and after calling his two friends, one of them notices a photo of Adam chained to 
a wall, next to someone they knew very well - Mr. X, who returned to turn the peaceful city once 
again into a war zone. Now, Axel, Blaze, Sammy, and Axel's good friend Max, a pro wrestler, must head 
out to stop Mr. X once again...hopefully for good... 
 
Streets of Rage 2 differs from the previous title in several ways. There are changes in both graphics 
(characters now are bigger, more detailed and with more animation frames, and scenarios are less 
grainy) and gameplay (the rocket move was replaced by a special move that doubles in offense and 
defense along several new moves), along other new features such as life bars (and names) for all 
enemies and the radically different new characters.

T2 - The Arcade Game (c) 1993 Midway / Acclaim Entertainment, Inc. 
 
As the title states, this is the home conversion of the arcade rail-shooter based on the film 
Terminator 2: Judgement Day. Up to two players shoot through future and present levels as robotic 
killers reprogrammed to serve the human resistance. 
 
Both players wield a machine gun with infinite ammo that lowers its firing rate (overheats) as it is 
continuously fired. A secondary weapon (missile launchers in the future, shotguns in the present) has 
limited ammo but deals heavy damage. Powerups inside the game world include secondary weapon ammo and 
coolant for the machine guns, and are shot to be collected. 
 
T2: The Arcade Game features seven levels based on specific scenes or general concepts in the film. 
The first four levels act as a prelude, as the player guns down waves of metal Terminators across a 
post-apocalyptic Battlefield, a besieged Human Hideout, and through the security checkpoints of the 
enemy supercomputer SkyNet. After destroying the computer, players travel back in time to protect 
John and Sarah Connor, while also destroying every scrap of SkyNet research at the headquarters of 
its manufacturer. From there, players must fend off the indestructible T-1000 until the final 
showdown in the Steel Mill. 
 
Assets from the movie are used when possible, such as voice clips from Arnold Schwarzenegger, and 
close-up digital stills of Robert Patrick for the final battle against the T-1000. The Genesis and 
SNES versions also support lightguns (the Menacer and Super Scope, respectively).

go separate ways for a while. Tails finds an unknown island and decides to dub it Tails Island. While 
resting there, a large explosion occurs and a Flicky tells him birds are invading the island. 
 
Unlike the other games in the series, this spin-off is less of a traditional platformer, but has a 
much slower pace with rpg elements and a focus on puzzle-solving. Tails can walk, jump, fly 
(momentarily), hang on ledges and throw bombs. He starts with ten health points that can be 
replenished with rings, but the amount can be extended to 99 by collecting chaos emeralds. In the 
twelve stages Tails can collect up to 26 items. Per level however, he is only allowed to bring along 
four and this adds a tactical dimension. One of the most vital tools is the Remote Robot that can 
squeeze through small areas that Tails cannot reach. Underwater he changes into the small submarine 
Sea Fox.

Tails' Sky Patrol (c) Apr 28, 1995 JSH|SIMS Co., Ltd. / SEGA Enterprises Ltd. 
 
Tails' Skypatrol is the first solo adventure of the Sonic sidekick Tails in the Sonic the Hedgehog 
series and it was only released in Japan. 
 
While flying around, Tails discovers an island. It seems to be completely abandoned except for some 
mine cart tracks. As he lands on the island a cart approaches, and Tails hides in the bushes. The 
passing silver cart is driven by a woman who says she is Wendy Witchcart. She proclaims that 
everything on the island is hers and threatens to transform everyone in crystal who does not follow 
her rules. Tails, determined to save all the animals on the island, sets in a chase to the Witchcart. 
 
Gameplay is fairly similar to the Sonic series. Tails need to defeat enemies and complete obstacles. 
He can fly, but is constantly suspended. He carries a golden rind that is used to take out enemies or 
to latch on to devices. Sonic, the emeralds and Dr. Robotnik are not presented, and neither are there 
rings to collect during the levels. 
 
The game came to other territories as an unlockable minigame in the GameCube version of Sonic 
Adventure DX and as one of the titles in the Sonic Gems Collection.

The Terminator licensed game for the Sega consoles was a fairly standard side-scrolling platform

you take on the role of Kyle Reese and his quest to save Sarah Connor from termination. 
 
Because the game follows the movie so closely, the first mission which involves blowing up the SkyNet 
computer and escaping through time is one of the hardest and something that most players remember

from squares over adjacent squares. The result would either create a complex tile, or cancel out, 
resulting in the deletion of a tile. The goal was to clear the board entirely. Higher levels were 
designated by added tile complexity, and larger board grid sizes.

Ultimate Soccer (c) 1993 Rage Software Ltd. / SEGA Enterprises Ltd. 
 
Ultimate Soccer is a football (European) game composed by 64 (unlicensed) international teams, each 
with it's own values for running, ball control and strength. There are five game modes (friendly, 
penalty shootout, tournament, playoff and league), but the lack of password or built-in battery means 
each one of them must be completed in one sitting. 
 
The gameplay can be tweaked for the players' preference by changing several key aspects of the 
physics engine, such as wind strength and direction, ball weight (lighter balls travel higher, faster 
 and farther but are more prone to be deflected by winds than heavy balls, who barely lift of the 
ground and are slowed down by wet grass), tightness of ball control and players speed and momentum. A 
five-a-side mode, where the ball is never out of play is also included. Thanks to the many options 
regarding the physics, the game allows a lot of flexibility in playmaking, from building up the play 
with small passes from the midfield to belting the ball upwards in hope of a goalmouth deflection. 
 
Graphically, the game is similar to EA's Madden NFL series, with pseudo-3D effects allowing the view 
to be tilted up to show more detail up front or tilted down to show more of the field. 
 
The series later continued with Striker on the same console and Striker' 96 on PC, Saturn and 
PlayStation.

Virtua Fighter Animation (c) Mar 29, 1996 Aspect Co. Ltd. / SEGA Enterprises Ltd. 
 
Virtua Fighter Animation is an one-on-one 2D fighting game based on the Virtua Fighter anime series. 
It has two game modes: story and versus. 
 
In the story mode, the player follows the anime's plot, with anime style cutscenes before and after 
each fight. The story is divided in acts, each one of them corresponding to one fight. The player 
starts controlling Akira Yuki, as as he beats his opponents, each one of them joins his party, so 
they can be chosen in the next fights. Besides Akira, the other characters which become available are 
Pai Chan, Jacky Bryant, Wolf Hawkfield, Kage-Maru, Sarah Bryant and Lau Chan. In the final act, the 
player must fight against Dural. 
 
The versus mode allows players to choose any of the seven available characters to fight against the 
CPU. In the two player versus game, Kage-Maru is removed from the character selection. 
 
The Game Gear version has 3 different viewing modes: Normal, Large and Real-Time. The Normal viewing 
mode shows the fighters from a more distant position (smaller sprites) than the Large mode (larger 
sprites). The Real-Time mode simulates the zooming camera effects from the other Virtua Fighter 
games, alternating between the Normal and Large modes. It also has an extended intro sequence, with 
anime style cutscenes. 
 
In regards to gameplay, the game doesn't differ much from any other 2D fighting game, as the player 
can perform punches (button 1), kicks (button 2) and jumps (up), as well as some special maneuvers. 
The Game Gear version has also a block function (START button), absent in the Master System version. 
The fights are regular best of 3 round matches, and players will loose a round if one of this three 
possibilities happen: their energy is depleted, they fall out of the ring or they have less energy 
than the opponent if the time runs out.

Wheel of Fortune (c) 1992 Imagitec Design Ltd. / GameTek, Inc. 
 
Wheel of Fortune: featuring Vanna White is one of a series games based on the famous TV game show. 
The goal is to solve a word puzzle by guessing letters. The players take turns spinning a wheel that 
has designated money amounts in most spaces, but can also bankrupt the player in the wheel lands on 
the wrong space. A player can guess a letter and if that letter is in the puzzle, those spaces are 
flipped to reveal the letter and the player earns the cash amount specified by the wheel spin, 
multiplied by the number of occurrences of the letter. Only English consonants can be guessed-- the 5 
English vowels can be purchased using a player's earnings. 
 
This NES edition of the game allows 1, 2, or 3 human players to play against each other. Human 
players can also elect to play against computer players and at 3 difficulty levels. 
 
The Vanna White Edition differs from previous Wheel of Fortune games on the NES in that it actually 
bears the likeness of Vanna White. Also, there are avatars for the player contestants, and the wheel 
animation is different.

Wonder Boy (c) 1991 Westone Co., Ltd. / SEGA of America, Inc. 
 
Just when things were going great with Tom-Tom and his girlfriend Tanya, some thug of a woodland king 
had to kidnap her and hide her away, and Tom-Tom doesn't have a clue where. That's why he has to 
explore deep dark forests, cross endless oceans, climb treacherous slopes, survive endless volcanoes, 
and even walk through clouds. But Tom-Tom will never be totally alone. You see, when he goes through 
the exotic locations, he has to come face to face with its inhabitants, like bees, spiders, snakes, 
coal-kids, frogs, bats, snails, coyotes, and octopuses, to name a few. The hatchet is Tom-Tom's only 
line of defense against these menaces. 
 
There are ten areas, each containing four rounds each, but the tenth area can't be accessed unless 
Tom-Tom collects all the dolls during his rescue mission. During his journey, he can break open 
different eggs that will reveal hatchets, skateboards, mushrooms, milk, and even guardian angels. You 
can ride the skateboard through each round, as long as you don't collide with an inhabitant. When you 
complete each round while still riding the skateboard, you'll start the next round still riding it. 
As you progress through each round, your vitality will start to get low, but it can be increased by 
getting milk, mushrooms, potato chips,or fruit that appear everywhere you go. As well as the normal 
eggs, there are also speckled eggs that must be avoided, otherwise the God of Death will be released, 
and once he follows you, you'll lose vitality much quickly. At the end of every fourth round, there 
is a king waiting to destroy you with his fireballs or lightning bolts. 
 
There are also warp-gates, but you don't find them, they find you. You see, warp-gates appear in 
rounds 1-4 of each area. If you happen to get one fruit, a special item will appear. These special 
items include handbags, wrist watches, a pair of shoes, a teddy bear, and a bottle of perfume. 
Another girl will appear and take you up to the clouds where the object is to collect as many hearts 
as you can without falling down or getting the item again. Once you have collected all the hearts, 
you can get the item to return to the surface, and more often than not, you'll get further in the 
round.

Wonder Boy - The Dragon's Trap (c) Mar 27, 1992 Westone Co., Ltd. / SEGA Enterprises Ltd. 
 
Wonder Boy III: The Dragon's Trap is a direct sequel to Wonder Boy in Monster Land. When Tom-Tom 
defeats the MEKA dragon, the wounded beast casts a spell on him, turning him into a Lizard-Man. To 
regain your original human form, you have to find the Salamander Cross, hidden by the Vampire Dragon 
in Monster Land. 
 
In this side-scrolling platform game, you can still buy equipment and items, but unlike its 
predecessor, it is not divided in sequences of levels. You are allowed to go anywhere, as long as you 
have the right shape or equipment. During his quest, Tom-Tom has to defeat various dragon bosses. 
Each win will give you a new shape with new abilities such as flying, swimming, walking on ceilings 
or clinging to walls, which also give you to access new parts of the world. The possible shapes are 
Lizard-Man, Mouse-Man, Piranha-Man, Lion-Man and Hawk-Man and the main abilities are defined by 
attacking power, defense points and charm points (needed for equipment by collecting charm stones). 
Also, certain blocks can only be destroyed by specific weapons or are only accessible to certain 
shapes. 
 
The basic actions consist of attacking and jumping, and in the status screen you can equip swords, 
shields and armour. Special attacks include fire balls, tornadoes, arrows, boomerangs and thunder 
strikes. Along the way, you collect keys (only one at all times) and gold left behind by defeated 
creatures, and you often have to revisit places to access new areas. A password is given at the 
beginning of each town to continue from there.

Woody Pop (c) Mar 01, 1991 SEGA Enterprises Ltd. / SEGA Enterprises Ltd. 
 
Every system must have a Breakout clone, and every self-respecting developer must have one, 
especially in the mid-eighties, following the success of Taito's Arkanoid. Sega's answer was called 
Woody Pop. 
 
With a wooden paddle, which in fact is Woody the tree spirit, you bounce your ball against bricks 
laid out in a big house filled with toys. The toys will come out to disturb you. When you hit 
"mystery bricks", wind-up toy soldiers or robots come out, obstructing your ball. On some levels, a 
toy train will cross your path as well. Speaking of wells, the bottom of the screen is not a big 
black hole as in most other games of this kind – instead the whole covers only a part of the wall, so 
that even if you miss the ball, it might bounce back in the corners. 
 
Once a room is cleared, you can choose freely between up to three adjacent rooms to progress to, 
making this game less linear than usual. 
 
Like any post-Arkanoid game, there is a range of powerups released from special blocks. Most are 
known from other games such as the double-ball, the growing bat or the "diamond ball", which destroys 
all blocks in its path without ricocheting. Some invented by Sega are the fire ball, which sets 
blocks on fire, allowing them to destroy even neighbouring blocks, and the big ball, which hits 
bricks with more power, thereby destroying brick with one hit that would otherwise have required 
several.

World Class Leader Golf (c) 1991 Access Software, Inc. / SEGA of America, Inc. 
 
Before the long-running Links series, Access produced the Leader Board lineage, which concludes here. 
Wind, snap and power are the main considerations as you dodge the bunkers, water and rough which make 
for more complex courses than the 8-bit versions of the original. 
 
A course editor is provided.  The courses provided include real courses like St. Andrews, a fictional 
designs such as The Gauntlet, which as the name suggests is designed to push your skills to the 
maximum. 
 
The PC version revolutionized the use of the PC speaker to reproduce voice samples via their patented 
"RealSound" process. Quips like "No doubt about it, he's deep in the sandtrap", "Straight onto the 
fairway", and "Looks like he hit the tree, Jim." are used to provide running commentary on the 
gameplay.

X-Men (c) 1994 SEGA Enterprises Ltd. / SEGA of America, Inc. 
 
X-Men is a sidescrolling beat'em up/platform game, much like its homonymous Mega Drive/ Genesis 
  counterpart. Several X-Men characters are playable throughout the game. The player can choose from 
  two characters from the start, Cyclops and Wolverine, and three Levels are accessible. In the 
  course of the game, the player can unlock five other X-Men, namely Storm, Iceman, Rogue, 
  Nightcrawler and Psylocke. 
 
The story is that most of the X-Men have been kidnapped by Magneto, which is the reason why only 
Cyclops and Wolverine are available from the start. Apparently, unlocking the characters equals 
rescuing him. On the way, there several foes from the X-Men universe to beat, and at the end, Magneto 
once again needs a reprehension. 
 
The basic mechanics of the game are punching, (double-)jumping and jump-kicking. Furthermore, 
pressing Start activates/ deactivates the characters mutant ability, for example Wolverine's claws or 
Cyclops' laser beams. Using it however drains a limited amount of energy, which can be refreshed by 
finding "X"-symbols.

X-Men - Gamemaster's Legacy (c) 1995 SEGA of America, Inc. / SEGA of America, Inc. 
 
This X-Men is a follow-up to Arcade's Revenge where once again the player can take control of their 
favorite mutants Wolverine, Bishop, Gambit, Storm, Rogue, Jean Grey & Cyclops, each with their own 
unique abilities and powers.  Each character has a unique ability vital to some stages such as 
Storm's and Rogue's ability to fly while Cyclops and Gambit has long range capabilities and 
Wolverine's raw power. 
 
The story starts off with the world in peril as a deadly virus called the Legacy Virus is spreading 
throughout the world and is threatening to extinguish all of mankind.  The X-Men learn of a cure that 
has been developed by a scientist by the name of the Gamesmaster and ask for his help, but in order 
to obtain the antidote they must first compete in a series of games scattered throughout the world by 
beating up various enemies and avoiding pitfalls and traps.  To make matters worse, Gamesmaster has 
promised the X-Men's arch-rivals that if they can stop the X-Men from completing their tasks that 
they can have the antidote and destroy the only hope for mankind. 
 
The gameplay is a 2D side-scrolling beat-em-up with eight stages total that range from the Arctic to 
Egypt and the Moon with the ability for the player to choose the location they wish to explore first 
at the beginning of the game.  Players must advance through these stages using their powers, which 
are in limited supply, beating up various enemies and creatures and face off against an end level 
boss for each stage.

In a dark future, Mojo has his own TV show where the participants fight to death. He has imprisoned 
some X-Men from the past to recreate their greatest battles. Wolverine and Rogue have to enter the 
game and rescue their friends, then defeating Mojo to return back home. 
 
In this platform game, the player starts choosing either Wolverine or Rogue. At each new level 
beaten, a new X-Men will be available: first Gambit, then Cyclops, Havoc and finally Shard. If one of 
the X-Men dies, the player has to start the level again, choosing among the remaining X-Men the one 
to play. After all the X-Men have died, the game is over. 
 
Each character can activate his/her power at will. Wolverine can use his claws, Rogue can fly, Gambit 
can throw explosive cards, Cyclops will fire optic blasts, Havoc fires plasma blasts and Shard fires 
energy blasts. The characters have an energy meter and a power meter, which will worn out as they are 
hit or use their powers, respectively. They can find items to restore their energy and power. 
 
Gameplay consists basically in finding the way out of each of the six levels. Once finding it, the 
character will face a boss, usually known characters from the comics like Magneto, Fitzroy, a 
Sentinel, etc. The last boss is Mojo himself.

Yuu Yuu Hakusho (c) Mar 25, 1994 SEGA Enterprises Ltd. / SEGA Enterprises Ltd. 
 
Yu Yu Hakusho: Horobishi Mono no Gyakushu is based on the the manga / anime series Yu Yu Hakusho, 
which is about the teenage delinquent Yusuke Urameshi, who is appointed as an "Underworld Detective" 
after being killed in a car accident  while trying to save a child's life. His task is to investigate 
various cases involving ghosts and demons in the human world. 
 
The game is a classic side-scrolling beat'em up and offers several characters from the manga to play. 
Apart from, as expected, Yusuke the player can choose between Hiei, Kuwabara and Kurama. All 
characters have different values in five attributes like jumping or speed. The game offers some 
variations from the standard beta'em up formula: There are four different levels accessible from the 
beginning and can be played through in any order. However, after completing level, the player has to 
choose a new character he hasn't used yet for the next stage. If a character looses all his health, 
he has to fill it up with the health of the other characters and thus weakening them for the later 
levels. The game also switches to different mode for the boss fights. By turns, the player has to 
dodge an attack from the boss and then do a attack on his own by pressing Punch at the time when a 
moving cross-hair is over the boss.

The Minister approaches the King to tell him that his only daughter, the Princess, wants a new pet. 
But the King says she already has too many, and she can't take care of so many animals. Thus the 
Minister purposes a contest of skill and daring to select the Royal Zookeeper. Master Piggy then 
sends his pupil, Polly, to participate in the contest. 
 
Baku Baku Animal is a variation on the very often copied Tetris type of game. The game has three 
different play modes: practice, normal and hard. It also can be played by two players against each 
other (except for the Master System version). 
 
The objective is to pair animal heads with their respective food. If a rabbit head comes falling, you 
must make it fall on a pile of carrot tiles, dog heads with bones, panda heads with bamboos and 
monkey heads with bananas. There is a bonus item, the "BB coin", which will appear from times to 
times, and remove piled tiles from the playfield. Removed tiles will be sent to the opponent's 
playfield all at once, increasing the difficulty of the task. Polly will face several contestants, 
and she'll win when her opponents get their playfield piled to the top.

Arliel - Crystal Densetsu (c) Dec 12, 1991 SEGA Corporation / SEGA Corporation 
 
The continent of Tyramus has lived in peace for almost a century, thanks to the four elemental 
crystals of the kingdom of Arliel. However, peace is threatened by the invading armies of the Jyn 
Empire, led by Emperor Grym, who wants to use the four crystals to rule over Tyramus. Fortunately, 
Princess Iris can escape with one of the crystals and now the player has to protect her and the 
crystal and somehow find a way to drive back the hordes of Jyn. 
 
Gameplay in Crystal Warriors is quite similar to Shining Force. The player fights in turn-based 
battles controlling different characters like fighters, healers, rangers and mages, all with 
different strengths and skills. Whenever two units engage in battle, they enter a duel mode lasting 
for up to two turns. In this mode the player can choose between four commands: "battle" (attack), 
"retreat", "spell" and "monster". While the first three commands are quite self-explanatory, the 
"monster" command is interesting. Whenever a non-human enemy is defeated, it can be tamed and be used 
in battles. While most monsters do not have many HP they can serve as good attackers for physically 
weak characters or take some hits in order to protect his master. 
In-between battles the player can visit towns to rest, buy weapons and spells or recruit new party 
   members.

Ganbare Gorby! (c) 1991 JSH / SEGA Enterprises Ltd. 
 
Mister Greede, a corrupt tycoon and factory owner, deprives the local citizens of the goods they need 
and deserve. That’s why you have infiltrated his factory. Now you must manipulate the conveyor belts 
skillfully to deliver the correct product to the right person waiting outside, but you have only a 
limited amount of time. Unfortunately, thugs with bats or even guns patrol the factory. Your only 
weapon against these security guards is a battle cry that temporarily stuns them, but not for too 
long. 
 
Factory Panic consists of four rounds, and each round consists of eight stages. Before a stage 
starts, the game tells you how many people are waiting in line and what product they are waiting for. 
Rounds one and three are played in “Switch Mode”: step on different switches to rotate associated 
sections of the conveyor belt. If you get off the switch, the section rotates back to its initial 
position. One switch may affect more than one section. Since you can only step on one switch at a 
time, you have to bustle quite a bit in later stages. Rounds two and four are played in “Bridge 
Mode”: remove and install small bridges between the belts to control the flow of products. 
 
If a person gets an unwanted product, the time remaining on the timer will decrease. Sometimes, the 
belt carries special items, e.g. a megaphone that makes your scream attack more powerful, or a weight 
that can be placed on a switch.

coal-kids, frogs, bats, snails, coyotes, and octopuses, to name a few. The hatchet is Tom-Tom's only 
line of defense against these menaces. 
 
There are ten areas, each containing four rounds each, but the tenth area can't be accessed unless 
Tom-Tom collects all the dolls during his rescue mission. During his journey, he can break open 
different eggs that will reveal hatchets, skateboards, mushrooms, milk, and even guardian angels. You 
can ride the skateboard through each round, as long as you don't collide with an inhabitant. When you 
complete each round while still riding the skateboard, you'll start the next round still riding it. 
As you progress through each round, your vitality will start to get low, but it can be increased by 
getting milk, mushrooms, potato chips,or fruit that appear everywhere you go. As well as the normal 
eggs, there are also speckled eggs that must be avoided, otherwise the God of Death will be released, 
and once he follows you, you'll lose vitality much quickly. At the end of every fourth round, there 
is a king waiting to destroy you with his fireballs or lightning bolts. 
 
There are also warp-gates, but you don't find them, they find you. You see, warp-gates appear in 
rounds 1-4 of each area. If you happen to get one fruit, a special item will appear. These special 
items include handbags, wrist watches, a pair of shoes, a teddy bear, and a bottle of perfume. 
Another girl will appear and take you up to the clouds where the object is to collect as many hearts 
as you can without falling down or getting the item again. Once you have collected all the hearts, 
you can get the item to return to the surface, and more often than not, you'll get further in the 
round.

The Skweeks lived in harmony for centuries, being a naturally peaceful peoples, until Pitark arrived. 
He ruined their bright pink land by removing the colour, and it was only after he died that they had 
the opportunity to clean the land up. Your job is to travel through the 99 continents and clean each 
one in sequence. 
 
Skweek can move in each of the four compass directions, and is armed with a simple weapon, whose 
shots rebound around before they hit one of Pitark's minions, the Schnoreuls - contact with which is 
instantly fatal. Some squares contain arrows which force you in a particular direction, while there 
are also blockades to avoid. Bomb squares blow up surrounding squares but give you time to move away 
from them as they do this, while Shortcut squares allow you to move to another teleport-type square 
by pushing the joystick in its direction.

Sonic & Tails 2 (c) 1994 Aspect Co. Ltd. / SEGA Enterprises Ltd. 
 
Dr. Robotnik has stolen all the Chaos Emeralds, yet again, but when the experiment for his new 
    weapon goes wrong, the Emeralds get scattered across the island. While Sonic & Tails are out 
    searching for them, Robotnik finds the yellow emerald and convinces Knuckles the Echidna that 
    Sonic wants to steal all the other Emeralds. While all this is happening, Nack the Weasel seizes 
    his chance to take the emeralds for himself while everyone else is pre-occupied. Now it's a 4-way 
    race to retrieve the emeralds. 
 
The gameplay is like the other Sonic titles, but this is only available on the Game Gear. The player 
can choose to play as Sonic or Tails (who can fly), and you're trying to reach the Chaos Emeralds 
before anyone else. A change from other Sonic games is that when hit, all rings are not lost, only a 
set amount (30–50 depending on the level) is lost.

weapons ranging from knifes to rapiers and axes, that differ in range and efficiency. Secondary 
weapons are long-range weapons (pistols, bombs etc.) with limited ammunition. The game features 5 
Rounds divided into 3 stages. At the end of each stage, a boss must be defeated.

Virtua Fighter Mini (c) Mar 29, 1996 Aspect Co. Ltd. / SEGA Enterprises Ltd. 
 
Virtua Fighter Animation is an one-on-one 2D fighting game based on the Virtua Fighter anime series. 
It has two game modes: story and versus. 
 
In the story mode, the player follows the anime's plot, with anime style cutscenes before and after 
each fight. The story is divided in acts, each one of them corresponding to one fight. The player 
starts controlling Akira Yuki, as as he beats his opponents, each one of them joins his party, so 
they can be chosen in the next fights. Besides Akira, the other characters which become available are 
Pai Chan, Jacky Bryant, Wolf Hawkfield, Kage-Maru, Sarah Bryant and Lau Chan. In the final act, the 
player must fight against Dural. 
 
The versus mode allows players to choose any of the seven available characters to fight against the 
CPU. In the two player versus game, Kage-Maru is removed from the character selection. 
 
The Game Gear version has 3 different viewing modes: Normal, Large and Real-Time. The Normal viewing 
mode shows the fighters from a more distant position (smaller sprites) than the Large mode (larger 
sprites). The Real-Time mode simulates the zooming camera effects from the other Virtua Fighter 
games, alternating between the Normal and Large modes. It also has an extended intro sequence, with 
anime style cutscenes. 
 
In regards to gameplay, the game doesn't differ much from any other 2D fighting game, as the player 
can perform punches (button 1), kicks (button 2) and jumps (up), as well as some special maneuvers. 
The Game Gear version has also a block function (START button), absent in the Master System version. 
The fights are regular best of 3 round matches, and players will loose a round if one of this three 
possibilities happen: their energy is depleted, they fall out of the ring or they have less energy 
than the opponent if the time runs out.

Monster World II - Dragon no Wana (c) Mar 27, 1992 Westone Co., Ltd. / SEGA Enterprises Ltd. 
 
Wonder Boy III: The Dragon's Trap is a direct sequel to Wonder Boy in Monster Land. When Tom-Tom 
defeats the MEKA dragon, the wounded beast casts a spell on him, turning him into a Lizard-Man. To 
regain your original human form, you have to find the Salamander Cross, hidden by the Vampire Dragon 
in Monster Land. 
 
In this side-scrolling platform game, you can still buy equipment and items, but unlike its 
predecessor, it is not divided in sequences of levels. You are allowed to go anywhere, as long as you 
have the right shape or equipment. During his quest, Tom-Tom has to defeat various dragon bosses. 
Each win will give you a new shape with new abilities such as flying, swimming, walking on ceilings 
or clinging to walls, which also give you to access new parts of the world. The possible shapes are 
Lizard-Man, Mouse-Man, Piranha-Man, Lion-Man and Hawk-Man and the main abilities are defined by 
attacking power, defense points and charm points (needed for equipment by collecting charm stones). 
Also, certain blocks can only be destroyed by specific weapons or are only accessible to certain 
shapes. 
 
The basic actions consist of attacking and jumping, and in the status screen you can equip swords, 
shields and armour. Special attacks include fire balls, tornadoes, arrows, boomerangs and thunder 
strikes. Along the way, you collect keys (only one at all times) and gold left behind by defeated 
creatures, and you often have to revisit places to access new areas. A password is given at the 
beginning of each town to continue from there.
