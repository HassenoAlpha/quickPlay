007: Licence to Kill (c) 1989 Quixel / Domark Software, Inc. 
 
A "James Bond" action/arcade game based on the movie with the same name. Your aim is to avenge the 
death of Felix Leiter, who was killed by the drug baron Sanchez. 
 
Technically the game consists of several different vertical scrolling action sequences. In each stage 
you must fly, drive or walk through a preset terrain. While doing that, you have to shoot enemies, 
avoid their shots and collect items (mainly ammunition). Some levels rely more on shooting, while 
others test your reflexes.

10th Frame (c) 1986 Access Software, Inc. / U.S. Gold Ltd. 
 
Leader Board authors Bruce and Roger Carver tried their hand at tenpin bowling, in one of the game's 
earliest recreations. The process of bowling the ball involves timing a succession of clicks to set 
the right angle, speed and curve, similarly to Leaderboard's system. Three skill levels are provided 
- Kids level sets the speed and hook automatically, while Amateur has more margin for error with 
hook/slice than professional. The game is played from a plan view, with four other (empty) lanes 
visible. Single matches or a league structure can be played.

4x4 Off-Road Racing (c) 1988 Epyx, Inc. / U.S. Gold Ltd. 
 
As well as recreating off road racing, this game has considerable capability to upgrade your vehicle. 
There are four choices of vehicle on offer, each of which has its own weight/top-speed/build strength 
and so on, and thus is suited to different circuits. You can also buy upgrades and repairs, including 
carrying some spares. 
 
There are four completely different types of course, each taking place on a different surface - Mud, 
Ice, Desert and Mountains. Each of these is littered with hazards, which can either be painstakingly 
avoided, or driven through (with the resultant risk of damage).

AAARGH! (c) 1989 Binary Design, Ltd. / Melbourne House 
 
What's that coming over the hill, is it a monster? Yes, as this Rampage-influenced arcade game sees 
you play either an ogre or a dragon. Both are searching an island for an egg which will give them 
super powers. 
 
This is located inside a building, and to find the right one you must continuously smash them up, 
using either the ogre's horn or the dragon's tail. Humans must also be attacked as you see them, as 
their catapults weaken you. Food can be found to restore energy, 
 
Once you have located the egg, a one-on-one beat 'em up battle with your rival ensues - win five of 
these to finally win the game.

Abracadabra (c) 1988 Odisea Software / Proein S.L. 
 
A knight called Clus d'Eledorf falls in love with princess Violeta. The jealous witch Saligia, 
herself in love with Clus, puts a curse on the lovers: the knight has to remain haunting the castle 
Burgenfels as a ghost, while the princess is forever lost in the woods. 
 
Abracadabra is a Spanish text-adventure made with P.A.W. (Professional Adventure Writer), a popular 
Spectrum program. The parser is similar to the Infocom one: it supports most of the standard features 
of it at the time (chain commands, pronouns, adverbs, prepositions and adjectives, for example). The 
game is divided in two sections, with the second one loaded after the first is completed: 
In the first one, Clus has to break the curse and escape his prison. While in spectral form, the 
knight is destroyed if he leaves the castle. He can, however, roam freely through its halls to 
collect its objects and speak with its inhabitants. Burgenfels is a labyrinth with secret doors. 
 
In the second load, a reincarnated Clus has to find princess Violeta, his lost love,  in the 
Greenwald forest.

The Activision Decathlon (c) 1984 Activision, Inc. / Pony Canyon, Inc. 
 
The Activision Decathlon is a series of Olympic games similar to the Epyx games series. Up to four 
players can compete in the ten different events of a real-life decathlon, either in sequence or 
individually. Included are the 100-meter dash, long jump, shot put, high jump, 400-meter race, 
110-meter hurdles, discus throw, pole vault, javelin throw, and 1500-meter race. 
 
The flat running events involve simple joystick waggling, which must be balanced with 
accurately-timed button presses to clear the hurdles - hitting them or breaking stride causes a loss 
of momentum and thus time. For jumping and throwing events, you must build momentum by waggling and 
then press the button to throw or jump at what you feel is the appropriate moment. 
 
For each event, points are earned based on how well you do (this can be based on your running time, 
or how far you throw the javelin or discus, etc...), and the player with the most points at the end 
of the decathlon wins the gold medal.

Addicta Ball (c) 1987 Alligata Software Ltd. / Alligata Software Ltd. 
 
Addicta Ball is a Breakout clone with a twist. Players control a paddle to break down a wall of 
different block by bouncing a ball against them, but instead of removing them to clear a level, 
players need to make a path for the paddle to pass through. As time goes on, the bricks move lower 
down the screen so the path needs to be created as long as there is an opportunity. The game is over 
when the bricks hit the paddle. 
 
There are different kinds of power-ups, weapons, a thruster to move over the screen, and a barrier at 
the bottom of the screen that prevents the ball from disappearing, but it degrades over time. There 
are also some vehicles at the bottom of the screen that can be hit. Cooperative games for two players 
are supported.

to Master Higgins to gather throwing axes, fireballs and skateboards in order to aid his noble quest. 
 
The game is a side scroller, Master Higgins moves across the screen from left to right and finds his 
power-ups in giant eggs. This includes a skateboard which results in a great speed enhancement - 
until Master Higgins gets hit and loses his power. If he is not on a skateboard a hit means instant 
death. Another game mechanic is starvation which gets indicated through a meter which steadily 
decreases. If it hits zero the hero dies and the only way to fill it up is by collecting food on the 
way. Bosses await him at the end of levels, all the way to the Evil Witch Doctor himself.

Vulcan cannons (basically machine guns). In some versions there is an option to let the cannons shoot 
automatically all the time. 
 
The game is viewed from behind the plane with you fighting wave after wave of enemy fighters. But at 
heart it offers the usual shooter mechanics, meaning you spend most of your time dodging and 
shooting. Sometimes you come across a friendly supply plane and if you dock with it you can replenish 
your missiles.

A Lenda da Gvea (c) 1988 
 
Two million years ago, a spaceship crashed on what is today the Brazilian coastline. The alien 
survivors of the crash buried the radioactive wreck and the body of the ship's captain inside a huge 
rock and carved his likeness on it. On present day U.S.A., the Army starts experimenting with 
mind-altering technology on a few subjects. One of them enters a trance and starts relaying what 
happened all those years ago in Brazil. The U.S. government decides to investigate these claims by 
deploying troops near the Pedra da Gávea, the only structure matching the description on the 
brazilian territory. An alpinist hired by the Army as a guide discovers the plot and sends secret 
military documents to a friend, hoping he could unveil the mystery hidden inside the rock. 
 
A Lenda da Gávea is a text adventure from Brazil made with the G.A.C. utility. The parser is not as 
sophisticated as the one found on Infocom games, but it is a step-up from the verb-noun parser of 
Scott Adams adventures (it can't process chain commands, but understands pronouns). 
 
The game's main objective is to gain entrance to the Gávea rock. In order to accomplish this, the 
player has to collect several objects that are scattered around the area of dense vegetation 
surrounding it. Some of these objects are useless, intended as red-herrings. On the screen there are 
two pictures of a snake. As a warning, when approaching a dangerous situation they transform into 
pictures of an anthropomorphic figure of death. Even though the game is entirely written in first 
person, the game bizarrely warns about being hungry and thirsty. If the player don't drink or eat 
something in the game, after a few turns the death screen comes up.

20 years after the last fight with DIA51 an unidentified space fortress appeared and started an 
massive attack. Ray Waizen, the hero of the first Aleste game,  was a serving officer on board the 
first space ship that's been under attack and sadly got killed. His nineteen year old daughter, who 
is also a pilot, must save mankind and take revenge of her fathers dead... 
 
This second, MSX exclusive, installment of the Aleste series is as its predecessor: a very fast 
vertical shooter with a massive and extensive arsenal of weaponry. Many different types of enemy 
spaceships that are constantly attacking you and the area bosses are again huge screen filling

Aleste Gaiden (c) 1989 Compile / Compile 
 
The main difference of this vertical shoot 'm up with its predecessors Aleste and Aleste 2 is that in 
this installment of the series you're not flying a space craft, not even in a remote way. No, you are 
in control of a robot (maybe a humanoid). You are running around defending and attacking the enemy 
while avoiding obstacles and holes in the ground. For the rest it's pretty much all the same: it's 
fast, has many enemies, hard to beat level bosses and has lots of power-ups. If you destroy a space 
ship you will be rewarded with power-ups.

Aliens (c) 1987 Software Studios / Electric Dreams Software 
 
Electric Dreams' game based on the 1986 film Aliens is a first-person strategy game somewhat similar 
to Space Hulk. The player controls six characters from a remote terminal, guiding them through a 
255-room complex in search of the Alien Queen. Each character has a helmet camera and a smart gun, 
each controlled by the player acting in the role of overall operational commander. 
 
The player can switch to any character at any time, and must consider coordinating their movements 
and finding a safe location before switching to the next character. Characters occupy one room at a 
time, and can pan their view a full 360-degrees inside each room. Doors can be locked to halt Alien 
progress, or blasted open to get through (at the cost of permanently destroying the door). Alien 
bio-mass must also be destroyed before it spawns facehuggers, and the Aliens themselves leave lethal 
puddles of acid when killed (and so shouldn't be killed in front of doors!) 
 
Aliens prowl the complex and are attracted to gunfire. They will home in on nearby characters and 
attack, requiring the player to aim that character's gun to defend against the rushing Alien (a 
headshot kills instantly, while three to the body do the same).  If an Alien attacks a character the 
player is not controlling, they will "capture" that character (indicated by a yellow status light).  
The player must guide another character to the position of the hostage and kill the guarding Alien to 
rescue them.  If not, the captured character will be lost. 
 
Ammunition for all characters is limited, and refilled only by making a trip to the complex's armory. 
Similarly, a medical bay can replenish any damage. Characters also have limited stamina, used up with 
every move made. When stamina is low, the player must find a safe spot for that character to rest up. 
The complex also houses a generator controlling the lights, which the Aliens can destroy, or the 
Marines can then repair.

Whereas most platforms, including the MSX, received their own versions of Activision's Aliens, Square 
gave Japanese MSX users a unique spin-off. 
 
Alien 2 is an arcade platformer (or run'n'gun if you like) featuring Ripley on a planet infested with 
aliens. Armed with only a basic gun at first, she faces facehuggers that come out of alien eggs. 
After having dispatched a face hugger, the egg may be shot to reveal an item. Items may be hand 
grenades, stronger guns or wing items which make her jump longer. For some reason, the planet is 
infested not only with aliens and their offspring, but also with snakes. After clearing the surface 
level, Ripley enters a complex where the first boss, a giant, full-grown alien resides. The following 
level takes place within the complex.

Amazônia is a text-adventure in Portuguese from Brazil. One of the first computer games commercially 
released on that country, it has a parser inspired by the ones of Infocom and other companies,

chain commands, but understands pronouns). One unique characteristic of it is the requirement of 
accentuation on the Portuguese words. The game even provides special key combinations as shortcuts 
for accents to ensure compatibility with all systems. 
 
Given the plot line, the gameplay has a strong emphasis on its survival aspect: even though it is 
written in first person, the game bizarrely complains about being thirsty ("Hey, I'm thirsty!"). Wild 
animals randomly appear to threaten the player, and must be dealt swiftly to avoid death.

listener-friendly choices. Your choices affect the show's rating directly, as well as changing the 
forthcoming plot much more than in The Secret Diary of Adrian Mole. 
 
Characters can be removed from the show depending on how you develop certain storylines, but make 
sure not to axe the popular ones. Avoid offending special-interest groups, as the BBC comes down hard

Arcus (c) 1988 Wolf Team / Wolf Team 
 
The people of the kingdom Arkases have mastered the ways of magic, thanks to their connection to the 
world of spirits. However, the humans used their magical powers to wage war on each other and to 
disrupt the harmony. Finally, the Golden Dragon told the king of Arkases that his country will be 
punished for the deeds of the humans. Enter Jedah Chaf, a young man who has left his home village to 
fulfill his dream of becoming a knight. Will Jedah be able to save his country and to restore peace 
in the world? 
 
"Arcus" is a RPG that is played entirely from first-person perspective. You navigate your hero by 
choosing a location from a menu. Once in dungeons, you have a separate menu whenever you encounter 
enemies. You fight them in turn-based combat, attacking physically or casting magic. The game is more 
close to Western RPG style than to Japanese one, and utilizes AD&D terminology for character stats.

Arcus II: Silent Symphony (c) 1989 Wolf Team / Wolf Team 
 
Ten years have passed since the knight Jedah Chaf and his companions gained an audience with the 
Golden Dragon and made the choice that determined the destiny of the Arcusas land. The half-elf Picto 
was one of the five heroes who accompanied Jedah. A new adventure lies in front of him. Rumors of the 
legendary Rune Blade draw him out on a new quest, but his true mission will be to find his legendary 
companions and to rid Arcusas of a new terrible evil. 
 
"Arcus II" resembles a traditional Japanese-style RPG more than the first game. This time the 
navigation is done in top-down perspective in all the locations. The turn-based battles are still 
viewed from first person perspective. The enemies are visible on screen and the battle initiates once 
you come into contact with one of them.

Arkanoid (c) 1987 Taito Corporation / Taito Corporation 
 
The original Breakout concept involves controlling a bat at the bottom of the screen and using it to 
catch and direct a ball so as to hit all the bricks which are arranged at the top of the screen. It 
was unpopular for over a decade, before Taito revived it with some new ideas in this arcade game. 
 
The game's plot redefines the bat as a Vaus spaceship, the ball as an energy bolt, and the bricks 
form a mysterious wall stopping the ship from progressing to safety. 
 
By the mid-80s, power-ups were popular in most types of arcade games, and Arkanoid features them. 
They are caught by positioning the bat below them as they fall (meaning that you risk missing the 
ball if you go for them at the wrong time). The power-ups include lasers (which are mounted to each 
side of the ship and allow you to shoot out the blocks), a catching device (so as to be able to fire 
the ball off at a different angle every time you hit it) and one that slows the ball.... sorry, 
bolt.... down. Needless to say, the game inspired tonnes of clones, few of which added anything else.

Army Moves is a one-player game which is divided into two parts. In part one, you drive a jeep and 
must avoid collision with other jeeps and being shot at by helicopters. Then, you fly around in a 
helicopter and the oject is to bring down airplanes without being shot at by the airplanes 
themselves, submarines, and any other ground fire. Make sure you land on the pad near the end. 
 
In part two, you start out in the jungle and must jump from rock to rock without crashing into 
toucans (shoot at them to make them fly higher) and being blown to bits. Then you have to make your 
way to the general's offices shooting soldiers on the way, and finally, locate the secret documents. 
When you complete the seven sections of Army Moves, you'll receive a higher bonus. 
 
Some versions have a high score table to record your achievements. The second section must be loaded 
seperately, using a code attained from completing part one, on some versions.

Astro Robo Sasa (c) 1984 Mass Tael Co., Ltd. / ASCII Corporation 
 
This is a shooting game with a twist. You are in control of a small character who has to go through a 
serious of stages. Each stage consists of one screen only and contains several energy packs hidden 
behind various obstacles. Your goal is to eat up all the energy packs at a given stage, or (which is 
sometimes easier, but with dire consequences to the later stages) destroy them. If you manage to eat 
the energy packs, you'll gain more energy points, which carry over to the next stage. You'll need the 
energy points because every shot from your gun costs you one, and each collision with the various 
enemies flying around can deplete a large bulk of them. 
 
The twist of the game is in the movement: instead of simply flying around, you must shoot into the 
direction opposite of the desired movement. For example, if you shoot several times to the left, 
you'll be thrown to the right. Everything is built around the reactive force of your gun and the 
gravity force, which will slowly make you descend onto the ground if you don't shoot continuously. 
Preserving the precious energy points and trying to propel yourself exactly to the obstacles which 
you must destroy on your way to the energy packs is the only way to successfully complete the game.

In Monty On the Run the intrepid coal thief Monty Mole fled to the rocky island of Gibraltar. 
However, the Intermole agency is on to him, and his only hope of escape is to trek across Europe, 
collecting enough cash to buy the Greek island of Montoss and live there in luxury. 
 
This is Monty's third game, and the structure is similar to the previous two. It's platform and 
ladders based, with 80 screens each representing some area of Europe - the Eiffel Tower and the 
Leaning Tower of Pisa are among the identifiable landmarks. 
 
There are different ways of travelling through the levels - some bouncy platforms coupled with a new 
super-leap move allow for big progress to be made, while Monty can also suspend from the ceilings and 
dodge his way across. Monty can now fall without being hurt, although landing on water can cause 
multiple lives to be lost in quick succession. 
 
There are many items to collect  - the most important are Eurocheques for money and airplane tickets. 
Once on a plane you must fight off the encroaching Intermole planes for extra points.

red button that could wipe out the world! 
 
You must use diplomacy, make treaties, issue risky, covert CIA or KGB actions, or riskier, direct 
military intervention to prop up 3rd world countries or help their insurgents and win them to your 
governmental philosophy: Capitalism or Communism. The world is a big place... and the other guy could 
start a nuclear war over a country as tiny as Tunisia. This game is the ultimate Cold War simulation. 
Every action requires careful analysis and the ability to judge your opponent (computer or human) and 
his reaction. 
 
The game features 62 countries, each carefully researched with up to date (as of 1985) information 
regarding their government, demographics, resources, etc.  This game is very challenging, and will

In the year 3037, the most competitive sport in the known universe is Ballblazer. For the first time 
ever, humans from the planet Earth have won the right to compete in the final round of the Ballblazer 
Championship, to fight for Earth's honor and the title Masterblazer! 
 
Ballblazer is a 3D futuristic soccer-like game, where the player (inside a Rotofoil) is set on a 
one-on-one 1,155 square playing field (the Grid). The objective of the player to kick a floating ball 
(Plasmorb) inside the opponent's goal (Goalbeams). A player may compete against a human or computer 
opponent. 
 
The Rotofoil is equipped with a multi-purpose forcefield. This forcefield when in short distance of 
the Plasmorb will act as a pull field, automatically pulling the Plasmorb towards to player. When a 
player in possession of the Plasmorb shoots, the forcefield will act as push field and launches the 
ball. When the match starts, the player must move down field and attempt to gain possession of the 
Plasmorb using the joystick and blast the Plasmorb to an intended direction. 
 
The player should also be aware that the Goldbeams move slightly every second and the distance 
between them will shrink. The highest scoring goals are goals made when Goldbeams have disappeared 
across the horizon (Over The Horizon/OTH shots). A player may also attempt to steal possession of a 
Plasmorb by rushing beside the opponent and blast the Plasmorb away. The game ends when time runs out 
or a player wins 10 consecutive goals. If the game ends in a draw, over-time will apply and the first 
player to score will win the game. 
 
Scoring 
 
Close-in goals - 1 point 
Goals near Goldbeams - 2 points 
OTH shots - 3 points 
Players may steal points from each other by making goals. 
The total combined score of both players cannot accede more than 10 points. 
A player winning 10 consecutive points automatically wins the game.

Banana (c) 1984 Studio GEN / ASCII Corporation 
 
In Banana, you are a round little thing on the Amazonas river, hunted by the man-eating Boconda 
tribe. A bit like Q*Bert, you jump around on stones in the river. Jumping is done by placing a 
cursor, with limited range, above a stone. If you don't place it right above the stone, you instead 
jump into the water. This isn't necessarily lethal, since you can jump up on adjacent stones, or you 
can go with the flow, as long as you take care not to pulled by the strong current into a spot where 
there are no stones to seek refuge on. It is also in the water that you will catch bananas coming 
down the stream. 
 
Bananas are necessary to get rid of the Bocondas

Bandit Kings of Ancient China (c) 1991 KOEI Co., Ltd. / KOEI Co., Ltd. 
 
In the 12th century, the Emperor Hui Zhong is faced with an internal rebellion led by Imperial 
Minister Gao Qiu.  The Song Dynasty comes to an end, and Gao Qiu became the new ruler.  You take the 
role of an exiled ruler, and you must build your stats up to be able to challenge- and destroy- Gao 
Qiu and restore Hui Zhong to the throne. 
 
The game is a military strategy game, like most of Koei's games, but instead of conquering a country, 
the goal is to depose the despotic ruler of China.  You start out lowly, and have to work your way up 
by conquering smaller prefectures, forming alliances, and fighting small battles.  You have to earn 
the right to attack Gao Qiu's home prefecture, though- he is off limits until you are powerful.

Bank Buster (c) 1988 Method Solutions LLC / Method Solutions LLC 
 
The only way to break into a well-stocked bank is to head underground, and smash your way through 
layer after layer of earth. This makes for a game influenced by Breakout, but with many subtleties of 
its own. 
 
You have full control over the bat, able to move up and down as well as left and right. The latter 
can be useful as only part of the bottom of the screen actually results in the ball going out of play 
- a wall protects much of the floor. There are inbuilt trees which can't be played through, and 
dynamite sticks which can clear large sections of earthing at a time.

Bank Panic (c) 1985 Sanritsu Denki Co., Ltd. / Dinamic Software 
 
Bandits are holding up a bank and have taken people hostage, and as a gunslinger, it's your job to 
shoot them. The bank has 12 doors, and the bandits are behind each one of them. When they pull a gun 
out at you when you open a door, you have only a few seconds to shoot them before they shoot you. If 
you shoot them too early (ie: before he sticks his gun out at you), it is considered unfair, and you 
won't score any points, but if you're too late, he'll shoot you and you lose one of your three 
lives.If you waste too much time, a bandit will come out from one of the doors and stick dynamite on 
it. You must then shoot the dynamite to get rid of it. 
 
If you're lucky, either a man or a woman will throw you a bag of gold coins. If you shoot any of 
these people by accident, you also lose a life. More often than not, the person will throw his/her 
hands up, saying "I haven't got anything". That's when they will be replaced by bandits. 
 
Some men will carry three to five pieces of gold on top of their heads, and shooting at all of the 
gold will award you with a bag of gold coins. Others will be tied up with rope. If you shoot the 
rope, there's more money for you, because not only will you receive one bag of gold coins, but you'll 
get three bags of gold coins. 
 
There are more than ten rounds in Bank Panic, and each one ends when a person behind all 12 doors was 
able to throw you a bag of gold coins. The rounds get difficult the further you get. For example, in 
later rounds, a few bandits will block your shot, and you have to then shoot twice. Also, regardless 
of what round you're on, you can shoot so many bandits before time runs out.

When a command is highlighted pressing fire will perform that action thus saving on extra buttons 
being needed to play. There are two weapons at your disposal. A sword which you start the game with 
and later a bow which is handy for long range attacks. There are many traps to avoid and various

Barnstormer (c) 1985 
 
You are a stunt pilot who are supposed to crash into a water tower, but your path is blocked by a 
multitude of hot-air balloons. To get them out of way, you must hit their baskets with flour bombs 
thrown out of your plane. While your plane can fly both up, down, left and right, it has a great 
inertia, and thus you risk at all times to run into one of the balloons or into the borders of the 
screen at an uncontrollable speed. Your speed also makes the bombs fall at different paths, which 
means that hitting the small baskets requires both precision and timing. The air is also filled with 
clouds that can release deadly bolts of lightning. Once all balloons are grounded, you should fly to 
the beginning of the screen and then pick up your speed so that you can smash straight through the 
water tower at the far end of the screen. 
 
Points are given for bombing balloons, flying through storm clouds, picking up fuel from the ground 
and breaking the tower. Extra lives are given each 10 000 points. Every second level takes place in 
daytime, every second one at night.

Batman (c) 1987 Ocean Software Ltd. / Pack-In-Video Co., Ltd 
 
Robin was repairing the Batmobile when he was kidnapped. Before Batman can contemplate rescuing him, 
he must reassemble the car from its seven parts. There are all over the Batcave, in this isometric 
arcade adventure taking in over 150 screens. 
 
Initially Batman lacks his super powers, which must be collected. The Batbag allows you to pick up 
and drop objects, Jet Batboots allow you to jump, the Thruster allows Road-Runnering (movement while 
you fall), and the Low Gravity Batbelt keeps you in the air for longer. 
 
Short-term bonuses of invincibility, extra energy, and extra life and an enhanced jump can be 
collected, but there is also one which neutralises all power-ups. You have eight lives, but each 
cluster of Batstones acts as a restart point - when it is game over you can return to that spot, with 
lives and equipment as they were.

Blasteroids (c) 1989 Atari Games Corporation / Image Works 
 
As the name suggests, this arcade conversion updates the basic Asteroids gameplay. That means to say 
that the main gameplay consists of flying through single-screen wrap-around levels shooting at rocks, 
which split into smaller rocks when hit, eventually becoming small enough to disappear. 
 
In this case the Asteroids are protecting Mukor, an evil being who is poisoning planets under the 
Colonising Corp’s control. 
Each level is split into either 9 or 16 sub-levels, which are chosen through a square in which any 
remaining level which is adjacent to the last level completed can be selected. There are 3 different 
ships (Speeder, Fighter and Warrior), which can be switched between at any time. Power-ups (including 
improved weapons, shield recharges and a faster thrust) can be collected by flying into them.

This is an overhead-viewed racing game similar in style to Super Sprint. There are 7 courses of 
increasing difficulty, incorporating ramps and bumps which significantly affect the bike's handling. 
Each course has a time limit you must complete 3 laps of the course within, or it's game over. The 
further inside the time limit you are, the more points you score. 
 
There's a computer opponent, but the scoring isn't affected by whether you beat him just so long as 
you qualify. There is a two-player mode. A unique feature at the time is the action replay, which can 
be viewed in slow motion.

Boggy '84 is one of those games of which countless numbers were made in the early eighties during the 
homecomputer boom. It is slightly similar to Mappy or Space Panic but without the refinements of said 
games. 
 
You are a man who must collect a set of keys on a level with several floors. You can jump between 
floors using springboards, which gives you an advantage over your enemies, who must use the ladders 
to climb between floors. You must also use those in order to descend to a lower floor, mind you. 
Later levels add touches such as a a ski slope which you must ascend while avoiding the baddies. 
Hitting them from below will put them out of action, though.

Bokosuka Wars (c) 1984 
 
King Ogreth of the Basam Empire has invaded your country and either captured or turned into rocks and 
trees all your soldiers. You, king Suren, are left completely alone. In a desperate attempt, you 
decide to walk to king Ogreth's castle and to defeat him. You hope you'll be able to find some way to 
bring your soldiers back to you... 
 
In this strategy game, your goal sounds simple – just walk a distance of 600 meters and defeat king 
Ogreth. But to do that is not simple at all. Bumping into trees and rocks, king Suren can bring his 
soldiers to life. Once there are some knights in his small army, he will also be able to free 
imprisoned soldiers. King Ogreth's units will constantly attack you on the way. The results of the 
battles are calculated automatically, according to the strength of your units. So before you engage 
in a battle, you have to be sure you have the upper hand (you have gathered enough soldiers, they 
have trained in easier battles, etc.). If king Suren dies in a battle, the game is over - you'll have 
to start from the beginning no matter how near you were to your goal.

Each bomb explodes into a cross-shaped blast (4 directions) which can destroy either enemies or 
blocks. Power-ups may be found to increase the size of the blast, place additional bombs, increase 
the speed of the Bomberman or to walk through walls. Your goal on each level is to destroy all 
enemies and escape through the exit before the time limit is up.. Hitting the exit with a bomb blast

Take control of a football team in a division below the top one, and try to lead them to glory in 
both league and European competition. You start with a squad of 12 players, whose names can be 
changed, but have room for 15 players in total, with chances to buy and sell players. You can take 
out a bank loan, the level of which depends on your division. 
 
The team's formation can be customised, and as outfield players are not limited to a single position, 
you can customise the team's strengths and weaknesses in quite a precise way. Matches are played out 
by listing scorers as they happen, and are followed by a full list of the division's other results. 
Finances change after each match to to wages, gate receipts, and possible incidents such as riots and 
illegal player approaches.

Break In (c) 1987 The Bytebusters / The Bytebusters 
 
As the title implies, this is a game about breaking into banks, as well as a Break-Out clone. 
 
Each level is a bank, consisting of several rooms. You can only leave a room after your ball hits a 
key. As a burgler, you are symbolised by a pair of eyes, on top of which a paddle rests. Similarly to 
Woody Pop, parts of the bottom of the screen is covered up, so that you need not guard the ball as 
much as in other games. Unlike most Break-Out clones, you can move freely over the entire screen so 
as to hit the ball at the perfect spot. If you miss the ball and it passes through the void at the 
bottom, it falls back into the earlier rooms, just like in the Amiga classic, Poing. If you catch it 
there, you can send it back to the room your were in. In the last room of each bank, you should hit 
the money that is in there, before you hit the square with a calculator, which will calculate your 
score for that bank. Later vaults feature a bell which must not be hit, or it will wake a guardian 
that will hunt you across the screen. 
 
As in all post-Arkanoids, powerups are available, in the shape of a circle that bounces across the 
screen, all the while changing colours. Depending on which colour it is when you pick it up with your 
paddle, you get one bonus out of a range which corresponds to the basics of most games in the genre, 
such as wider paddle, sticky paddle, multiball and firepower.

is used to reflect a bouncing ball into the bricks. When the ball hits a brick, it will destroy it. 
You start with five balls, and the game ends when all five fall off the bottom of the screen. Also 
included are several game variations, including breakthru (the ball will go straight through bricks 
instead of bouncing back), timed breakout (you have a time limit to gain as many points as you can), 
and invisible breakout (the bricks are only visible for a short while after one of them is hit).  
Other variations allow you to catch the ball or control the direction of the ball.

proceeds. Each manager competes with human and computer controlled teams in a ten strong league and 
the F.A. Cup. From the second season onwards, each team will also enter a European competition 
(League Champions to the European Cup, F.A. Cup Winners to the Cup-Winners’ Cup, and the remaining 
clubs will go to the UEFA Cup). 
 
The winner of Brian Clough's Football Fortunes is the manager who survives to the end of the game and 
has the highest number of game points. Game points are points awarded by the computer program, based 
on each managers performance in League and Cup competitions and on the amount of cash the player has 
left at the end of the game.

The late martial arts hero features in this platform game, with the aim of reaching a wizard in an

In each area you must collect the many strategically-placed lanterns before exiting through the 
newly-revealed passageway. Some rooms also have escalator-type sections to run along, and the 
standard (although slightly illogical in this context) ladders. 
 
On the way, you'll fight two enemies - a ninja and a green sumo warrior named Yamo. You can defeat 
them by punching, kicking, dropping on their heads or luring them into hazardous terrain, or even by 
making them accidentally hit each other. Even after they are killed, however, they keep coming back 
for more after a few seconds. Since they can move pretty intelligently (they even climb ladders), you 
should watch out for them. 
 
There are lots of hazards to avoid by either walking round or jumping - walls of electrical charge 
and exploding bushes for example.

Bubble Bobble is the story of two humans, Bub and Bob who wander into the mysterious cave of monsters 
and magically turn into dinosaurs. The only way to transform back is to reach the end of the cave... 
 
Bubble Bobble is a platform game, with each level being a single screen. The enemies must be cleared 
from a level to go to the next one. With one player controlling Bub and the other controlling Bob, 
the player can jump and collect items for points (such as fruit). The real power Bub and Bob have 
however is the ability to blow bubbles. These bubbles can be as platforms to leap on, or to trap 
enemies. Enemies trapped in a bubble must be popped by jumping into them, wherein they'll turn to 
fruit. Additionally, power-ups sometimes float by in bubbles. They include lightning, which flies out 
horizontally at enemies, and water, which drags the player and enemies straight down flowing over 
platforms. Taking too long to complete any level will summon Baron Von Blubba, who will float around 
the screen trying to destroy the player.

Budokan: The Martial Spirit (c) 1991 Electronic Arts, Inc. / Dro Soft 
 
Budokan is a martial arts game covering Karate (unarmed combat), Kendo (using a wooden sword), 
Nunchaku (using piercing chain weapons) and Bo (using a staff). The player has a realistic range of 
moves and must use them wisely, as Ki (life-force) is drained for every move made, whether successful 
or not, and both this and your stamina level must be kept high. 
 
You can practice your skills alone, or spar against the instructors or your friends. Finally, when 
you feel you are ready, you can travel to the martial arts world championship tournament at Budokan.

Bumpy (c) 1989 Loriciels / Proein S.L. 
 
The first game in the Bumpy series is, just like its sequels, about a head that can bump a lot. You 
control whether the head shall bump left or right, and how far up it will bounce, across a series of 
bouncy platforms. Once you have picked up all items on the screen, the exit appears so that you can 
go on to the next screen. 
 
While most platforms are perfectly harmless, some have additional qualities, such as being 
destructible, thereby granting access to other parts of the screen. Some platforms are on fire, which 
will turn out lethal unless you have picked up a water droplet in advance. 
 
Bumpy was remade for 16-bit platforms as Pop-Up, and then ported back once more to the Amstrad CPC.

Burai: Gekan - Kanketsu-hen (c) Nov, 1992 Riverhill Software Inc. / Riverhill Software Inc. 
 
The game is a direct follow-up to  Burai: Joukan, continuing its story. The eight heroes who were 
chosen by the magical pearls to stop the plans of the evil Bido to resurrect the dark god Daar 
continue their journeys. The young demon warrior Jakimaru is angry at Hayate for killing his 
companion, and he offers his service to Bido, who still hopes to defeat the eight heroes. As before, 
the player can choose to start as any of the heroes. However, since some of the heroes got together 
during the course of the previous game (Alec and Kuuku, Hayate and Lilian, etc.), there are only five 
different chapters to start with. 
 
The core gameplay remains the same - top-down navigation, random enemies, turn-based combat. However, 
the battles use the same turn-based perspective as over-world navigation (as opposed to the 
first-person view in Burai: Jouken).

But Daar had followers, among them a powerful warrior named Bido. He intends to resurrect Daar and 
attack the king of Kypros. His minions attack three strongest knights who serve the king. But before 
he died, one of the knights released eight magical pearls. Each pearl can choose a hero, and eight 
heroes together would be able to stop Bido. Those heroes live in different places and belong to 
different races - humans,  dragons, lizard-men, dog-like wosshus. Among them there are simple 
fighters, a thief, a powerful sorcerer. But they all know - the future of Kypros lies in their 
hands... 
 
Burai: Joken is a Japanese-style RPG with top-down navigation, world map and towns, random enemies, 
first-person turn-based battles, party management, etc. Its stand-out feature is the ability to play 
as eight different heroes. Each hero starts in a different part of the game world. The characters 
have different abilities and spells at their disposal, but overall follow the same gameplay template. 
The intro sequence presents the heroes in a particular order (starting with the thief Hayate, who was 
caught and thrown into prison), but the player can choose to start as any of the eight heroes.

BurgerTime (c) 1986 Data East Corporation / Dempa Shimbunsha 
 
You play as Chef Pepper and your goal is to make giant hamburgers while evil eggs, sausages and 
pickles chase you around the game area. 
 
To properly make a hamburger you must assemble all of the ingredients together, dropping them from 
higher up onto the the burger area below. To actually do this you have to let Chef Pepper step all 
over the burger ingredients. As soon as an ingredient (a piece of lettuce for instance) has been 
stepped on, it will fall to the next level below. Falling food will squish any enemy following you 
and will also"bump" any other ingredient bellow it farther down. Also, as an emergency defense 
against the enemy food, you can collect pepper shakers which will allow you to puff out a small 
pepper cloud which will momentarily stun enemies, allowing you to walk past them. 
 
Higher levels result in new level design, faster enemies and more ingredients to assemble. 
 
The PlayStation 2 version is a port of the original arcade game and comes with a soundtrack disc, a 
DVD, a guide book and some other bonuses.

Chaos Angels (c) 1989 ASCII Corporation / ASCII Corporation 
 
One day, a lone traveler came from the desert to a small camp. There, he sat down, weary from his 
long travel, enjoying a short rest. "Have you heard of the Tower of Ouroboros"? - asked him a bearded 
old man who was sitting nearby. - "A legend says that if fulfills all your wishes. Many heroes tried 
their luck there. None has returned. Dangers lure at every corner in the tower, deadly enchantresses 
who will bring demise on anyone daring to set his foot there". Without answering, the young traveler 
left the camp, and soon he was standing at the tower gate... 
 
"Chaos Angels" is a semi-erotic RPG similar to the first two  Dragon Knight games. The entire game is 
viewed from first-person perspective. You gradually explore the huge 3D dungeon, the Tower of 
Ouroboros, fighting enemies and gaining experience points. The combat engine differs from most other 
Japanese-style RPGs: for attacking, instead of choosing an appropriate command from a menu, you hit 
the enemy by moving towards it. You can also sometimes see the enemies approaching and turn to 
different sides during battle. Like in Dragon Knight games, the enemies are mostly sexy girls wearing 
revealing clothes or simply naked.

Chase H.Q. (c) 1989 Taito Corporation / Ocean Software Ltd. 
 
As an undercover agent of Chase Headquarters, your job is to patrol the streets and track down five 
criminals. You are given a mission briefing before you start which gives information on the suspect 
and what car they drive. Then you drive across the city without crashing into other cars, and catch 
up with the criminal's car. To arrest the suspects, you must keep bumping into their car until it is 
no longer functional. And you have to do this under a strict time limit. You can't afford to crash 
into cars or buildings or you waste time getting on the road again. 
 
However, once you've caught up with your suspect, you are given more time. Your car is also equipped 
with turbo boosts, which you can use to gain extra speed if you are way behind the criminal. Each 
arrest is based on a "suspicion".

Chicken Chase (c) 1986 Bug-Byte Software Ltd. / Bug-Byte Software Ltd. 
 
Players control a cock who is making sure that his wife delivers at least one of her children into 
the world. The cock automatically goes into the back room to mate with his wife, who lays an egg 
shortly afterwards. After this, it is up to the player to make sure that there is at least one egg 
among the two rows of nests, and that the egg is not destroyed by snakes, rats, raccoons, porcupines, 
and the like that are smart enough to climb the ladders leading up to the nests. 
 
The creatures enter the henhouse from either side, and must be moved along by pecking at them. As the 
cock walks around the henhouse, its energy will decrease. It must be replenished by eating chicken 
feed at both sides of the henhouse. Only then will the cock move faster. 
 
Upon entering the back room, the player must wait until one or more hearts appear at the top of the 
screen, as they indicate the number of eggs the mother will lay. Since there are ten nests, up to ten 
hearts can only appear at a give time. 
 
When an egg sits in the nest long enough, a egg will hatch out, and the resulting chick will make its 
way toward the back room, ring the bell outside the door, then go on in. If one of the creatures 
destroy an egg, or the only egg in the nest hatches out, the player loses a life, and the game is 
over when all lives are lost.

Choro Q (c) 1984 Taito Corporation / Taito Corporation 
 
The Choro Q video game is based on Takara's Choro Q cars (also known as Penny Racers). In each level 
of this platform game you - a Choro Q car - have to build two other cars. The components from which a 
car must be built are chassis, engine and coachwork, what of course must occur in the correct order. 
During your attempt to build cars you are pursued by hostile cars and tanks. When the first car is 
assembled entirely it then will change into a coin. Collecting that coin gives you temporarily 
invulnerability, so you can chase the hostile cars and tanks for bonuses. Don't drive too fast or you 
will fall from the platform or crash into the wall.

Choy-Lee-Fut Kung-Fu Warrior (c) 1990 Positive / Positive 
 
He raised from the Hell and sighed. On his face the wrath of a demon and the ambition of thousand 
devils. He sprouted like a bad seed in the temple of Shaolin, whose walls lodged the best fighters of 
all times. The destiny has decided that the last hour for the good has arrived, because the yellow 
devil seized the original manuscript where Cheng Heung wrote the art of the Choy Lee Fut. 
 
Supported on the force of the five magical animals, the speed and the technique of a good apprentice, 
we will cross the temple of Shaolin until finding the monster and recovering the scroll. We are 
expert in punches, we handle the sabre with ferocity and make the flexible lance more penetrating and 
versatile. And all thanks to the Chi. As first action, we will have the possibility of training with 
the Dummies (the wood men), where we will practice the distance, the speed and the use of 
complementary techniques. From which we will get up ourselves into the dynamics of the fight and the 
confrontations hand-to-hand with the partisans of the evildoer. 
 
The movements are varied, all of them based on the Fung-Fu techniques. With different arms we will be 
able to execute different movements using the same keys. Everything depends on the animal that our 
personage will adopt. The graphical theme also changes according to the fight scenes, including the 
face of the old man that observes us.

Chuckie Egg (c) 1984 A&F&nbsp / A&F&nbsp 
 
In the game you play Hen House Harry who has to collect 12 (a dozen) eggs from each level, while 
avoiding the ducklings.  The levels each occupy a single screen, and are made up of platforms, 
ladders and lifts (or elevators), and are thus similar to those in classic platform game Donkey Kong. 
 Corn can also be collected, which stops the time limit from ticking down and also stops the bonus, 
collected when the level is completed, from decreasing.  The ducklings also eat the corn, however. 
 
There are only 8 distinct levels.  The ninth level is a copy of level 1, the tenth is a copy of level 
2, and so on.  However, on the second time around the ducklings that can use the platforms and 
ladders are replaced by the Mother Duck, who can fly around the level going through the platforms and 
ladders.  On the third time around, you have to face both the Mother Duck and the ducklings, and 
similarly on subsequent goes round, when there are more ducklings.

You are Charlie, a member of a circus troupe. Your job is to please the crowd by performing five

Stunt #1: You and the lion must jump through several rings of fire. Remember to avoid the jugs that 
emit fire. You must do this for 100 meters. 
 
Stunt #2: Walk the tightrope for 70 meters, avoiding the monkeys that get in your way. Jump the cyan 
monkeys for 500 points. 
 
Stunt #3: Roll on a ball for 80 meters, jumping from ball to ball. You can move balls backwards if 
the target is too close to make a successful jump. Avoid contact with the ground. 
 
Stunt #4: Ride a horse for 200 meters, bouncing on trampolines along the way. Be careful not to miss 
the jump or go over the tops of trampolines. You can speed up or slow down the horse. 
 
Stunt #5: Finally, trapeze from swing to swing for 50 meters. If you miss, make sure that you land on 
the platforms below so you bounce back on a swing. 
 
Once you have completed all five stunts, you have to do them again and hopefully, more points will be 
awarded.

in deserts, as well as inhospitable mountain ranges or mysterious walled cities. 
 
The plot of the game turns around a fabulous treasure, an immense amount of accumulated wealth during 
centuries by the priests of an old culture dedicated to the adoration of the god Cobra. According to 
the tradition, the temple where the priests jealously kept their jewels, diamonds and objects made 
with the most precious metals, was constructed on a ship, reason why it resisted the great deluge. 
Now the fortune hunters have as obsession finding at all costs the palace of the god Cobra. But for

The star of Thing on a Spring returns in this sequel. The evil Toy Goblin is up to his old tricks, 
with his giant toy factory producing thousands of evil toys. In order to shut down the factory, Thing 
must travel through the factory's 11 different levels and  collect the tape, floppy disk, listing 
paper and ROM chip scattered throughout. 
 
The levels are filled with slopes, conveyor belts, interconnected pipework (years before Sonic the 
Hedgehog), and lots of foes to avoid. Question mark times have variable effects: stepping onto them 
reveals bonus points, objects, or a large weight that squashes Thing flat. 
 
As Thing takes damage from enemies or weights, his oil level is reduced. When Thing runs out of oil, 
he becomes rusted and the game ends. To move between levels, Thing must enter the pipework through a 
vent and bounce around the pipes to find an exit.

Colony (c) 1987 Icon Design Ltd. / Mastertronic Ltd. 
 
Mankind has established a distant colony, but the area is infested with ants, ladybirds and other 
parasites, all ready to cut through the perimeter fencing and eat your people's food. As a service 
droid it is your job to prevent this, and maximise the output. 
 
Achieving this involves a lot of planning and resource management. There are several buildings at 
your disposal, containing seeds, solar panels, weaponry, fencing and traps. You must plant the seeds, 
use the solar panels to maximise their growth, and then harvest the finished product so as to trade 
it. You can carry a gun to take care of the bugs, but this needs recharging frequently, and the 
location of the munitions store must be determined. 
 
When the bugs break part of the fence, you need to replace it to stop lots more coming through. This 
can be done more quickly by reducing the compound size, which causes the trade-off loss of growing 
room.

Columns (c) 1990 SEGA Enterprises Ltd. / Telenet Japan Co., Ltd. 
 
Columns is loosely derived from Tetris, as it involves arranging falling blocks in such a way as to 
clear them. However, in columns they are groups of 3 same-size but varying color blocks, which must 
be arranged into sequences of 3 or more, either horizontally, vertically or diagonally. Sequences of 
4 or 5 count for double or triple points, and diagonal sequences score the most. The real trick is to 
set up 'combos' - where one line causes other blocks to drop so as to create other lines. 
 
As well as the normal game mode, there is also a 'flash' mode, in which the aim is simply to remove a 
particular block from the base of the pre-formed pile of bricks. The difficulty of this can be 
determined by increasing the number of complete rows which are already in place.

Comando Tracer (c) 1988 Zeus Software / Dinamic Software 
 
In the year 2046, the Industry of Intelligent Androids (MOXAT) has created the DERGON system, a 
revolutionary artificial intelligence standard based on human thoughts. 
 
Contrary to what was expected, the new system is going to be a catastrophe for mankind: those 
intelligent machines spread throughout the entire confederation of planets XATOR sowing death and 
desolation. 
 
The only way to stop them is to destroy the planets in which they are located. With this purpose, 
MOXAT has been placing high-powered explosive charges for more than two years in the affected 
planets, and now it is time for you to detonate them. 
 
"Comando Tracer" is an arcade game in which we control a spaceship that is able to wear weapons and 
ionic piles, which we will need to detonate the explosives of each planet, before we arrive to the 
transport platform in order to go to the next planet/level.

Computer Scrabble (c) 1985 Psion Software Ltd. / Leisure Genius 
 
Computer Scrabble is the earliest official computer version of the popular word game. The game has an 
11000-word dictionary containing the most frequently-used words in Scrabble. As a result, some very 
obscure words (mostly of 2 and 3 letters - keen Scrabble players will know that these are often the 
most profitable scoring method) are included, but common words such as 'bigot' and 'sheen' are 
queried by the game - simply tell it that your move is a word and it will move on trustingly. 
 
Inputting words is done by moving the cursor across or down to the starting position of the word, and 
then pressing to key the word in, pressing space before the letter you wish to use a blank tile as. 
All words formed are accurately scored. The game can juggle your tiles and allow you to manually 
rearrange them, and you can watch the computer 'think' as it notices possible moves and their 
scoring. There are four difficulty levels, with the highest capable of combined scores over 700.

Three star stones have been hidden in locked treasure chests within a castle inhabited by dragons, 
guards, spiders, tarantulas wizards and the like. Battle Hero Redham is brave enough to take on such 
a task, and it is only by obtaining these that he can rescue Taleria. 
 
Although Redham is armed with a small supply of daggers (more can be collected), these can only be 
fired while he is stationary, and the graphics are drawn large so that not much is seen on each 
screen. This means that a lot of advance route-planning is required, although most creatures can be 
killed by landing on their heads (horizontal contact with them is however fatal). The tarantulas are 
perhaps the deadliest foe, as they move so quickly. Treasure chests are located along the route, 
containing various potions and poisons as well as extra weapons.

The car has high and low gears, and is susceptible to damage from contact with another car. Once you

As the name indicates, Corsarios is a game focused on sea affairs, which consists of two independent

hordes of pirates whose only obsession will be killing us. Some of them will use all kind of deadly 
weapons, such as the famous saber or a blunderbuss. Luckily for us and unfortunately for them, our 
protagonist is quite capable when it comes to fight with punches and kicks. So if all goes well, you 
will find a small boat which is awaiting you at the other extreme of the island. 
 
The second part, to which we can access without the need of finishing the first one, takes place in a 
pirate galleon. There we will have to represent the role of the hero once again and we should try to 
rescue the beautiful damsel. Now the game system is quite different from the first part, because we 
will be no longer able to directly blow our enemies, but we will have to use a sword to finish with 
all of them. The objective consists in ascending to the pirate flags which are in the different masts 
of the ship and, in the end, to arrive where the girl is before she ends being food for sharks.

Crazy Golf (c) 1983 Mr. Micro Ltd. / Mr. Micro Ltd. 
 
Nine holes of chaotic top-viewed ricochets and hazards make up this early Crazy Golf game. They can 
be skipped for a score of 12 if you get stuck. There are no moving hazards, so gameplay is 
essentially a golf-themed precise positioning puzzle. Furthering this aspect, it does not matter what 
pace the ball it at when it reaches the hole (it never rebounds out of it) and that rebounds are 
always at precise 90-degree angles without taking pace out of the ball. 
 
Sixteen shot angles and sixteen shot paces are available. The first hole is simply a row of 
vertically-placed barriers with only small gaps at each end, but later holes include randomly-placed 
ball-sized blocks, curved barriers almost enclosing the hole, and square blockades leaving only 
narrow corridors to play (bounce, more effectively) the ball through. The final hole combines all 
these for a par-12 challenge.

The hero, who does look a bit like The Cure's Robert Smith dressed in Mega Man's clothes, starts out

traversing the cursed landscape, you enter a castle, which will be directly recognisable to anyone

Equipped only with a whip, the hero must choose his battles. However, strewn across the levels are 
keys which will open chests containing bonuses which will render (short-term) invincibility, lengthen 
your whip or grant you a subweapon, such as a throwing dagger or an hourglass to freeze time 
momentarily. Subweapons consume hearts, which can be found not only in chests, but by destroying 
monsters or whipping down candles from the castle's walls. 
 
The Cure features a soundtrack with several pieces throughout, swap-screen "scrolling" and both

Cybernetic Hi-School Part 2: Highway Buster (c) 1990 Gainax / Gainax 
 
Something strange is afoot in town. A midnight rider is assaulting drivers on the highway, bombarding 
them with tricky quiz questions. If the driver can't answer the questions, he and his car is blown 
up. Out of fear of the so-called Highway Buster, people dare no longer use the highways. 
 
As a student at the Cybernetic Hi-School, the player is given the task by the headmaster of finding 
out who the Highway Buster is, and ultimately defeat him. 
 
The game is a minimalistic adventure game, where the player goes around the campus and town using 
seven commands. Talking to people advances the plot, though the player have no input on what to say, 
merely receiving what others tell them. Their first task to get on with the case is to get a vehicle, 
which they are lent by the headmaster. Before they can leave school grounds, though, they must pass a 
test to get a driving permit. This is where the other main part of the game commences. 
 
Cybernetic Hi-School is not only an adventure game, but also a strip-quiz game, which is slightly 
novel compared to the more common strip poker and strip mahjongg games. If the player gives the right 
answers to the driving knowledge test conducted by the female police officer, she will strip for them 
(for reasons unknown). When she is naked, the player will get their permit, and can leave the 
premises to find the leader of the school's touring club, who they must also beat in a quiz to see 
her naked and acquire the driving techniques they will need to beat the Highway Buster. All questions 
in the game are driving related, although they later on stray from the more mundane legal paragraphs 
to about car and bike related pop culture trivia.

Cybernetic Hi-School Part 3: Gunbuster (c) Nov 20, 1990 Gainax / Gainax 
 
Just like the two previous Cybernetic Hi-School games, the third part is a strip quiz game. This 
time, it is centred upon Gainax's famous Gunbuster animation videos. 
 
You, as an alpha-class Top, are supposed to win three keys to pilot the Great Gunbuster robot against 
the cosmic threat to humanity. The keys are held by Jung-Freud, Kazumi (oneesama) and Noriko, and you 
must retrieve the keys by defeating each character in a quiz game, which has the side-effect of 
stripping them of all their clothes. 
 
Each character asks questions around a certain theme

Cyberun (c) 1986 
 
The planetary system called "Zebarema" is the only place in the universe where you can find 
cybernite, the hardest material known to man, and key to generating enormous power and wealth. To 
exploit the unique resources of the planets, a ship is constructed and sent to Zebarema. 
 
All this boils down to a Jetpac-influenced game where you fly your ship around a hostile planet, at 
first picking up pieces of your ship in order to make it fully functional, then finding resources. 
You have a laser gun and a plasma weapon at your disposal to fight the enemies which float around or 
are actively hunting you. The sky is also filled with dangers such as acid rain clouds, hovering 
lasers and meteor showers. The undulating terrain is equally dangerous.

The Dam Busters (c) 1985 Sydney Development Corp. / Comptiq 
 
Dam Busters is an early flight simulation, set in World War II. It focuses on Dam Busters who 
historically were used to heavily bombard strategic objectives, in this case dams. 
 
This task is not easy, as en route you will face heavy opposition forces. Fortunately, you won't be a 
sitting bomber in the air. Your aircraft is equipped with machine guns (left and right) with 
unlimited rounds of fire power, so fire at will as the enemy approaches. 
 
When the time comes, you will have to bomb the target manually. So, get ready to unload the cargo and 
give them hell!

secret weapon which poses a threat to world security. After DM says that it is an easy task, he and 
Penfold leave for Germany in their mousemobile. Unfortunately, finding the Pi-Beam would be difficult 
since the Baron has set many traps that DM needs to overcome. 
 
Danger Mouse in the Black Forest Chateau is an adventure game which involves the player reading a

Dark Sider (c) 1986 City Factory / City Factory 
 
Have you ever wondered how and why evil appeared among us? It all started with jealousy. That was the 
first dark emotion that possessed human beings. Out of jealousy came doubt, then envy, anger, and 
finally hatred. Peace could no longer be maintained. Minions of darkness appeared among humans. The 
king and his counsel find a way to seal the heart of darkness, but it came to life again and 
destroyed the counselors. Now you, a nameless hero, is the king's and the country's only hope. Go, 
hero! Save our land from the forces of darkness! And don't ever, ever be jealous!! 
 
"Dark Sider" is a traditional console-style RPG with slight erotic content. Along regular monsters 
you'll fight some who resemble scantily dressed sexy girls. You navigate your hero from top-down 
perspective, and fight randomly appearing enemies in turn-based combat viewed from first person 
perspective.

The actor Charles Bronson played the iconic role of vigilante Paul Kersey in 5 movies where he takes 
the law into his own hands when he doesn't get justice and criminals get off.  This game is based on 
Death Wish 3 which came out in 1985.  A friend of Kersey in New York has been killed and he takes to 
the streets to help the police lay waste to gangs that are brutalizing and rioting in the city. 
 
He has a bulletproof vest that will protect him from several shots and can wield 4 guns: the 475 
Wildey Magnum, shotgun, machine gun, and rocket launcher.  Avoid shooting grannies on the streets, 
mean street-walkers and the police who occasionally will help you take out the baddies.  If you start 
shooting policemen, they will turn on you too. 
The upper half of the screen shows you the side-view of the street or building you are in.  The lower 
half shows your score, high score, injury meter, a scrolling police report so you can know where 
crime is taking place, a compass direction, a map which will also show you where weapons and bosses 
are located, and which weapon you are holding and the ammo left. 
When you enter a building, you can fire out the window for higher points but beware of enemies that 
may come up behind you.

Deus Ex Machina (c) 1985 Automata U.K. Limited / Nu Wave UK 
 
Deus Ex Machina is an unusual and experimental game by Mel Croucher. In 1987 all UK records of the 
Department of Health and Social Security, Police and State Security are then coordinated in a central 
data bank. The year after, passport, censorship operations and communications were integrated. By 
1994, the computer controlled all defense and internal security. Tuesday evening, the machine 
rebelled ... 
 
Players take control and follow the life of a "defect", in the shape of a human body, that has formed 
inside the machine. It is taken through all stages of life, from cells to senility, with many quotes 
from and references to William Shakespeare's The Seven Ages of Man from the play As You Like It ("All 
the Screen's stage and all the men and women merely players. They have their exits and their 
entrances, and one person in their time plays many parts, their Acts being Seven Ages"). The game is 
advertised as audio-visual entertainment. It contains no sound, but there is a cassette tape that 
needs to be played along with the game. Both sides contain 23 minutes of sound, forming 46 minutes 
which is also the length of the game as it is meant to be played in a single sitting. The tape's 
soundtrack contains singing, musical compositions, and speeches by a number of famous voice actors. 
They vaguely clarify the different stages of the game and often tease the player based on what is 
happening. The full transcript of the speech is also included in the manual. 
 
The player has to guide the defect through the different stages of life, constantly followed by the 
defect police. The game cannot be lost, but based on a number of actions a percentage shown all the 
time will vary. The player's controls consists of four directions, and the combination can form 
diagonal movement. The effect of the controls is different for every screen. Deus Ex Machina is based 
on a number of vignettes with limited gameplay. There are no win conditions for any part and controls 
do not appear to affect the game's progress. Screens have the player move a green dot between strings 
of DNA, ward off the defect police examining the body, jump over words such as "LIES" or "WAR" - 
where the relevance and atmosphere is generally provided through the background soundtrack. The game 
can be played without sound, but it does not make any sense that way. There are in-game instructions 
to synchronize and turn the tape.

Dig Dug is a 1-2 player arcade game in which you have to use your shovel to dig your way through the

chase you around. The only weapon that you carry is an air pump, which you can use to inflate the 
monsters to the point where they explode. (if you start to inflate them but stop doing so, the 
monsters will get turned back to their normal selves.) Furthermore, rocks are scattered throughout 
the earth, and you can use these rocks to squash them. If the monsters do not find you for several 
seconds, they will eventually get turned into ghosts, which are able to walk through the earth. They 
are invincible and cannot be killed. From time to time, vegetables will appear in the center, and you 
can get these for points.

You are Akineki Nakashima, a 17-year-old Japanese student and computer freak. You developed a program 
that allows you to communicate with demons via your computer and to summon them. To test your new

traverse the mazes of the demon realm and to rescue Yumiko. 
 
The MSX version of "Megami Tensei" has little to do with the NES version (and with Megaten RPGs in 
general) gameplay-wise. It is an action game with RPG elements, in which you must fight your way 
through a series of mazes infested with demons, whom you must defeat in real time combat. You find 
many items and become stronger as the game progresses, but the emphasis of the game is not on 
character development but on action-oriented combat and exploration of the dungeons.

Donkey Kong (c) 1986 Nintendo Co., Ltd. / Ocean Software Ltd. 
 
Released in the arcades in 1981, Donkey Kong was not only Nintendo's first real smash hit for the 
company, but marked the introduction for two of their most popular mascots: Mario (originally 
"Jumpman") and Donkey Kong. 
 
Donkey Kong is a platform-action game that has Mario scale four different industrial themed levels 
(construction zone, cement factory, an elevator-themed level, and removing rivets from girders) in an 
attempt to save the damsel in distress, Pauline, from the big ape before the timer runs out.  Once 
the rivets are removed from the final level, Donkey Kong falls, and the two lovers are reunited.  
From there, the levels start over at a higher difficulty. 
 
Along the way, Mario must dodge a constant stream of barrels, "living" fireballs, and spring-weights. 
 Although not as powerful as in other future games, Mario can find a hammer which allows him to 
destroy the barrels and fireballs for a limited amount of time.  Additionally, Mario can also find 
Pauline's hat, purse and umbrella for additional bonus points. 
 
Donkey Kong is also notable for being one of the first complete narratives in video game form, told 
through simplistic cut scenes that advance the story.  It should also be noted that in versions of 
the game for early 1980's consoles, Donkey Kong only used 2-3 of the original levels, with the cement 
factory usually omitted.

The lovely Marian was rescued from the clutches of the Black Warriors gang by Billy & Jimmy Lee in 
the first Double Dragon game, but now the gang has killed her in retaliation of their early defeat. 
The Dragons must now embark on a mission to avenge her death and defeat the Black Warriors for the 
second and final time. 
 
The original arcade version of "Double Dragon II" was essentially an improved version of the first 
game. In addition to offering renewed audio and visuals, as well as new traps, moves and enemy 
characters, "Double Dragon II" discarded the conventional punch and kick buttons in favor of a 
direction-oriented attacking system similar to the original Technos beat-em-up Renegade. 
 
The NES version offered new stages, new moves and illustrated cut-scenes, as well as a new final boss 
and a new ending. Unlike the first NES game, it offered 2-Player Co-Op gameplay with the option to 
turn off the friendly fire. 
 
The Game Boy version of "Double Dragon II" is an English localization of a "Kunio-kun" game (the 
Japanese franchise which inspired "Renegade" and "River City Ransom" and has nothing to do with the

1.  A medieval fantasy tale entitled Princess Fantasy, in which the player controls a knight who 
   accompanies a princess on a journey. Depending on the personality choice, the knight can either be 
   brave and compassionate, or cynically take advantage of the helpless girl. 
 
2.  A typical "naughty doctor" story, in which the player - as either male or female school doctor 
   - has to "examine" young and pretty female patients, trying not to scare them away by employing 
   too direct methods. 
 
3.  An encounter between a famous female pop idol and her fan (also female), which leads to a 
   bizarre sexual experience. The player can choose to control the events from the point of view of 
   either the star or the fan. 
 
The gameplay is essentially that of a visual novel. At almost every screen, the player is given a 
number of choices, which correspond to answers or actions, according to the situation. Some choices 
are required to trigger the next event and advance in the game, others are "neutral", having no 
effect on the progress, while a few are considered "bad" by the game, leading to Game Over. Scenes, 
dialogue choices, and story events may vary slightly or significantly, depending on the choice of 
character in the beginning of a scenario.

D.P.S. SG (c) Dec 15, 1990 Alice Soft / Alice Soft 
 
D.P.S. SG is the second entry in the  D.P.S./Dream Program System series. Like the other D.P.S. 
  games, it is a collection of three short scenarios, which are unrelated to each other story-wise 
  and can be played separately. Those scenarios are presented as cartridges played on a fictional 
  console named Dream Program System. Each scenario allows the player to choose between two different 
  protagonists, or two different personalities for the protagonist. All of the scenarios feature 
  nudity and/or sexual situations. 
 
The scenarios in this game include: 
 
1.  A traditional account of a private lesson given by an experienced male tutor to a cute teenage 
   girl. It can be player as either the teacher or the student, the latter involving deliberately 
   giving wrong answers to English questions in order to gain time to seduce the teacher. 
 
2.  An episode entitled Fahnen Fliegen (German for "flags flying"), depicting capture and torture 
   of a female war prisoner by an SS officer. The player can choose to control the officer, 
   effectively torturing the victim himself, or take the role of a soldier who tries to ease her 
   pain, hoping to gain her sexual favors. 
 
3.  A scenario set in the  Sengoku period of the Japanese history, in the house of the famous 
   warlord Oda Nobunaga. It is possible to play this scenario as Nobunaga himself, or as his 
   daughter, the spoiled princess. In either case, the goal is to seduce the cute maid who works in 
   the house. 
 
The gameplay is the same as in other D.P.S. games. At almost every screen, the player is given a 
number of choices, which correspond to answers or actions, according to the situation. Some choices 
are required to trigger the next event and advance in the game, others are "neutral", having no 
effect on the progress, while a few are considered "bad" by the game, leading to Game Over. Scenes, 
dialogue choices, and story events may vary slightly or significantly, depending on the choice of 
character in the beginning of a scenario.

Dragon Buster (1987) (Namcot) (c) 1987 Namco Limited / Namco Limited 
 
"Dragon Buster" is a conversion of Namco's arcade game from 1984. The game is composed of several 
large levels, each one containing various stages: a cave, a tower, a castle, etc. Your goal in every 
level is to reach the final stage where you face the level boss. There are often several ways to 
reach the final stages, and not all stages are necessary to visit. Equipped with a sword, you move 
through the platform-like stages, clearing them of diverse monsters, collecting power-ups and trying 
to stay in good health until the level boss, since you can't heal your character between the stages.

Dragon Eyes (c) Mar 02, 1991 Game Technopolis / Game Technopolis 
 
Dragon Eyes is a "space opera" kind of story, focusing on a young girl named Ines, who lives on the 
planet Miu of the Phi Sun. She grew up together with a space agent named Klind, to whom she refers as 
"brother". One day, her superior from the planet Garudoria informs her that Klind has disappeared 
during one of his missions and might be in danger. Ines travels to Garudoria to find additional 
information, and soon becomes involved in a vast space conflict... 
 
Dragon Eyes plays like a traditional Japanese adventure, with commands such as Examine, Talk, Think, 
and Move appearing on every screen. Choosing one of those commands usually leads into a sub-menu of 
objects. There is also limited usage of items, which is sometimes required in order to advance in the 
game. 
 
There are a few scenes with graphical nudity, but no explicit sex scenes.

Dragon Knight (c) 1989 Elf Co., Ltd. / Elf Co., Ltd. 
 
Strawberry Fields was once a peaceful land. Ruled by the lovely queen Luna and populated only by 
women, the country knew no trouble. The Goddess Tower protected the inhabitants of Strawberry Fields. 
But recently, something happened in the tower. It is said that a dragon descended upon it, spawning 
an army of dragon knights who were threatening the peaceful land. The queen Luna summons you, a 
wandering adventurer, to descend into the depth of the Goddess Tower and to purge the evil from the 
land. 
 
Dragon Knight marked the beginning of Elf's popular semi-erotic RPG series (the most known of which 
is Dragon Knight III, known in English as Knights of Xentar). Dragon Knight is played entirely from a 
first-person perspective. In the town, you move around by selecting destinations from a menu. Once 
you enter the tower, you navigate your character through 3D mazes, fighting random enemies in 
turn-based combat.

Dragon Knight II (c) 1991 Elf Co., Ltd. / Elf Co., Ltd. 
 
Strawberry Fields - a magic country populated almost exclusively by beautiful young girls (that is, 
if we don't count the Wise Old Man and a couple of other male exceptions). All went well in this 
peaceful place, until the evil witch Mesaana abducted some of the country's lovely inhabitants and 
placed a curse upon them, turning them into hideous monsters. Enter Takeru Yamato (whom you might 
knows as Desmond, the hero of Knights of Xentar), a young adventurer who happens to be in Strawberry 
Fields at that time. Takeru is told that in order to remove the curse one has to find three sacred 
writings, buried deep within three dangerous dungeons. Looks like a job for our adventurer - 
especially because the rescued girls will probably be very grateful! 
 
Dragon Knight II is the predecessor to Knights of Xentar, the only Dragon Knight game that was ever 
translated into English. This is a first-person game that is mainly dedicated to dungeon exploring. 
Takeru has to explore the three dungeons, fighting enemies and sometimes talking to dungeon 
inhabitants. The enemies are the girls who were turned into monsters by Mesaana. In town, Takeru can 
also buy weapons, armor, and items, and talk to various people.

Dragon Quiz (c) 1991 Compile / Compile 
 
Taking its name as pun on Enix's ever-popular Dragon Quest series, Dragon Quiz is an RPG where 
battles are not fought with weapons or magic. 
Set in the very peaceful Quiz kingdom, the story revolves around a prince and his fair maid (no names 
given, you must name your characters yourself). One day, the Quiz king gives his son a pet dragon 
which the prince soon becomes very fond of. Unfortunately, his girl friend is not equally fond of 
losing his attention, so she takes the dragon and leaves, intending to abandon it in a far-off place, 
so that it may never return and contend for her prince's love. 
Thus, the prince sets off to find his girlfriend and his pet dragon, somewhere in the Quiz kingdom. 
During his quest, he meets both friends and foes and lots of monsters. 
However, since this story is set in the Quiz kingdom, the battles are not fought using the usual RPG 
formula of weapons and magic spells. Instead, the monsters pose trivia questions which you must 
answer. If you don't give the right answer, you will lose health points. If you get it right, you win 
money, with which you may buy equipment or lodging to regain your health. Some adversaries won't let 
you pass unless you have enough correct answers, which means that your quiz prowess is somewhat 
equivalent to experience points in normal RPGs. 
Since Dragon Quiz is a tongue-in-cheek game from Compile, the questions range from linguistic matters 
(usually questions about Hiroshima dialect) and game trivia to technical matters or the Thunderbirds. 
If you know your 80s pop culture, Japanese and game history, you may get very far in this game. If 
you don't, it's unplayable.

Dragon Slayer: The Legend of Heroes (c) 1990 Nihon Falcom Corp. / Nihon Falcom Corp. 
 
"Dragon Slayer" tells the story of a young prince named Selios. One day his old teacher Raiyas sends 
him to a nearby cave to retrieve a magic weapon. When the prince returns, he finds the house attacked 
by monsters. Raiyas tells him to seek help in the castle of a baron, whose country has always been 
allies with theirs for a long time. However, the baron betrays Selios' trust and imprisons him. The 
young prince manages to escape, but without the possibility to return he has no choice but to wander 
through the land, trying to find trustworthy companions who would help him to save his country. 
 
This is a traditional medieval-themed Japanese RPG with turn-based combat viewed from first-person 
perspective (like in  Dragon Warrior games). The enemies are semi-random: they do appear out of 
nowhere and attack suddenly, but they are visible on the screen, and if you flee from a battle they 
will still be there to pursue you.

Dragon Warrior (c) 1986 Enix Corporation / Enix Corporation 
 
Dragon Warrior is the first famous console RPG. You assume the role of a descendant of Erdrick, a 
brave warrior of the past. Once upon a time, Erdrick defeated the evil Dragonlord with the help of 
the Ball of Light. Now, Dragonlord stole the Ball of Light, and your mission is to recover it and to 
restore peace in the world. 
 
In Dragon Warrior, you move your character around in a top-down world. In cities and palaces you can 
talk to people, rest in inns and buy stuff in shops. There's a variety of weapons, equipment and 
armor to buy. 
 
When wandering around in the wilderness, you occasionally encounter enemies, and fight them from 1st 
person perspective. Combat is turn based: you select menu options while fighting - you can attack 
with your weapon, cast a spell (using up some of your magic energy), use and item or try to run. 
Killing monsters gives you experience, and, as is typical for RPGs, you level up and improve your 
stats when you gain enough experience. 
 
Like in later RPGs, you have limited hit points, lose them when you are attacked by enemies, and die 
when you run out of them. When your character dies in a battle, he is automatically restored in a 
nearby town.

Drakkar is an action game where you take the role of Erik, a viking that has been contacted by the 
gods and was told to to collect the three objects that will let him become the king of his people: 
the parchment of wisdom, the Caesar laurels and the trophy of war. But he will not face his path 
disarmed, the gods have given him a shield that will protect him from the Roman arrows. 
 
Erik has travelled back in time with a magical drakkar (the ancient viking ship) and has to pass a 
forest that takes directly to ancient Rome, where there are his goals, but first he must consult the 
gods (in the game presented in the form of dragons) as the order for collecting the objects varies 
depending on the game. 
 
Our hero is armed with a truncheon and shield that has been given by the gods, but the biggest 
drawback is that such a weapon (plus the axes that he can get later) serves only to certain enemies, 
while in other occasions he should just avoid any kind of contact with them. 
 
The first group of enemies, namely the ones that can be destroyed, belongs to bats and the Roman 
soldiers armed with swords, maces or arches. The second group belongs to snakes and rats from the 
forest, fish in the ponds, the notes to the angels of heaven, which in addition to subtracting energy 
to Erik, leave him immobilized at the mercy of their enemies, and chandeliers, that although lethal, 
can just be found in the rooms near the parchment. 
 
But not everything was going to be bad for Erik, and so, besides the shield of the gods and axes, he 
can also recharge part of his energy through pears and fish, succulent delicacies have been 
distributed for the comprehensive mapping.

Duck Hunt is a shooting simulation where the player goes out with his faithful dogs to hunt ducks. It 
requires the use of the Zapper light gun. In game modes A and B, players view a swampland from a 
first-person perspective. The dog scares ducks (one or two at a time) out of the swamp, and they go 
flying around in the air. The player has three shots and a limited amount of time to shoot the ducks 
before they fly away. Each round only allows a limited number of misses in order to move on 
successfully. As the rounds progress, the ducks begin flying faster and faster, and fewer misses are 
allowed. 
 
Mode C features target practice on clay pigeons rather than ducks. The perspective and rules here are 
the same, with only three shots to destroy two clay pigeons before they disappear off the horizon. 
Destroy enough clay pigeons to move on to the next, tougher round.

Eagle Fighter (c) 1985 Casio Co. Ltd. / Casio Co. Ltd. 
 
Eagle Fighter is a basic vertical shooter with a 3D effect. 
You control a space craft that has to shoot and kill the alien invaders. 
What this game makes different from many other shooters is that before you can shoot the aliens you 
have to get your space craft airborne and it must be in air before the end of the runway! 
Once airborne, you can shoot all aliens. But remember, there is only a limited supply of fuel on 
board! You must shoot all aliens before you run out of fuel. 
After you've shot all aliens you have to get your space craft back on the ground to refuel for 
another mission.

Licensed around stunt legend Eddie Kidd, this game gives you the chance to recreate his death-defying 
feats. You start off attempting to jump oil barrels on a bicycle, with the bigger feats of jumping a 
motorbike over cars come later. 
 
You get no speedometer to help you judge speeds, but you can learn to gauge exactly how the bike 
handles and what it can do. 
 
You can position the start of your run-up, with wind needing to be factored in as an affect on the 
distance. Wheelies can be practices on the approach ramp. The further on you land, the better the

rooms laid out before him. You must guide Lolo through a room of tiles and collect all of the Heart 
Framers in the room. Doing this opens up a Jewel Box, which contains an item. Successfully acquiring 
the contents of the Jewel Box will clear the room of all monsters and open the way to the next 
room(s). All the rooms are connected but not all the room entrances or exits are closed. 
To fight the monsters Lolo has a weapon: the Magic Shot. Two shots can be obtained by collecting 
certain Heart Framers. There are numerous types of obstacles in the rooms. Emerald Framers are green 
blocks that Lolo may push around freely. To make it all more challenging there are also numerous 
terrain obstacles, like water, sand and grass which have all different drawbacks for Lolo.

El Cid (c) 1987 Dro Soft / Dro Soft 
 
This is a fictitious adventure protagonized by "el Cid Campeador", a Castilian hero who contributed 
magnificently to the Spanish "Reconquista" (the re-conquest of the Hispanic territories which were 
invaded by Moors, time period which starts on 722 and ends on 1492 with the taking of the last 
Hispanic territory, Granada). 
 
But talking about the game, we are on the XI century, a dark time full of incessant fights between 
the the good and the evil. A legend whose antiquity was lost in the abyss of the times, assured the 
existence a parchment that, with being read by the evil forces, would trigger such big wave of 
disasters that Satan would be able to seize the Earth and assure its dominion as prince of the 
darkness. 
 
Our audacious protagonist, when knowing the legend of the parchment, was decided to recover it for 
the forces of the good, since the legend also affirmed that if this document would be read by two 
persons of good intentions, their effects would be annulled for ever. 
 
With this objective in mind, he began to search the magical key, that released the spell that had 
hidden the parchment. But the task was not going to be simple, like him, many horsemen had decided to 
find the parchment, some with glory anxieties and others by less worthy reasons. Luckily for Rodrigo 
(el Cid), the many years of fight against the Moors had fortified their noble arm, reason why the 
combats by sword are no secret for him.

Elevator Action (c) 1985 Taito Corporation / Taito Corporation 
 
You are Agent 17 (codename: "Otto"). Your mission is to secure all top secret documents from a 
security building and escape in the getaway car, located in the basement of the building. 
 
Enemies spies are scattered throughout the 30-floor building and they have only one mission: execute 
Agent 17 at all costs. There are several ways in which Agent 17 can kill them: 
 
1. Shooting them with his gun. 
2. Kicking them by jumping onto them. 
3. Shooting a light on the ceiling while in an elevator, dropping the light onto one of them. 
4. Crushing them with an elevator. 
 
Whenever a light has been dropped, the hallways will be dark for a short period of time, making the 
enemy spies harder to see. The same holds true for hallways that are already dark. 
 
While Otto is in an elevator, he will have complete control of it by moving up or down. Agent 17 can 
still get killed if he's already in an elevator if a bullet's trajectory is aimed at it.. When Otto 
is not in an elevator, it will move from floor to floor automatically, even when enemy spies are in 
it. Otto is able to leap over the elevator gaps, but he must be as close to the edge as possible 
without falling off in order to make the jump safely. If there is an elevator cable in the way, 
however, it will block him, causing him to fall. 
 
Just because the game is called Elevator Action doesn't mean that elevators are the only means of 
travel. There are also escalators which you can ride up or down, useful if you want to avoid gunfire 
and don't have time to jump. 
 
Otto must go into the rooms with red doors to collect the top secret documents. If he tries to get to 
his car without getting all the documents, he cannot escape and must go back and collect the 
remaining documents. Once he has all the documents and drives away, he then proceeds to the next 
building. 
 
If Otto takes too much time to collect the documents, the alarm will go off, and he will have trouble 
controlling the elevators, which will take time to react. Bad guys will be especially aggressive. The 
alarm doesn't go off when Otto loses a life, it only resets after finishing a building. Besides 
ducking, bad guys may also drop themselves and lay flat on the floor. It's virtually impossible for 
Otto to shoot bad guys when they do this. Also, Otto cannot duck when in an elevator.

order to improve them we will have to chose difficulty level and then train flexions, displacements 
(with cones, flags...), ball juggling, dribbling, penalty shots, etc. 
 
And finally, on the second part (load), we will try to win the World Cup, for that, we will choose 
game length, control method and our team, then, we will be playing in one of the four (rather

European Games (c) 1987 
 
Like so many other "Games" games, European Games is primarily a joystick-waggler, with some precision 
elements thrown in. Taking place over five or six disciplines, depending on platform, you generally 
go left to right (or hit the right keys) with your joystick on those judged on speed, while pressing 
the fire button once a metre reaches its top (as in golf games) is the general method for disciplines 
such as shooting. 
 
Throwing is handled by releasing your hammer when the power bar is at the top, with additional 
rotation control on the Commodore. 
 
Cycling* is pure joystick action from left to right to simulate pedal motions. 
 
Shooting* requires positioning of your man and then timing your trigger to the power (accuracy) bar. 
 
Swimming involves more joystick action, but you also need to keep an eye on your air supply. Going up 
for air slows you down, though. 
 
The long jump involves yet more joystick action, until you reach the touchboard. Then you need to 
press the jump button at the right time, optionally choosing jump angle. 
 
Rowing** is like swimming, but without air. 
 
Weight lifting involves more power bar pushing, keeping the bar high constantly and lifting the 
weight before the time runs out. 
 
*MSX only. 
**Commodore only.

before he goes down. 
 
The game has three play modes. There is training mode to train your player before you enter a 
tournament. A ranking mode where you can select one of the three championships, Rookie, Japan and 
World. Each championship can be played at five difficulty levels. 
The third mode is the tournament mode.

Before you start you must create your character and set his initial abilities, strength, speed and 
stamina. 
Each won bout increases these abilities slightly. 
The abilities of your opponent and you are visible in the status bar at the top of the screen during 
the game. Strength is represented with a boxing glove, speed with a shoe and stamina with a dumb 
bell. 
 
This game can be played by one player against the computer or by two players against each other.

Fantasy Zone II: The Tears of Opa-Opa is the sequel to Fantasy Zone, in which you control Opa-Opa, a 
pretty colored ship with wings on its side. You must destroy the large creatures in each world before 
moving on to the next. Your task becomes difficult by other small creatures that happen to pass by. 
If you destroy a large creature, they will drop a dollar bill, which you can pick up and use at the 
shop to buy items and powerful weapons such as laser beams, x-way shots, and big wings. Another way 
to get money is to shoot certain kinds of enemies all in a row. 
 
More often than not, some large creatures will reveal a warp gate rather than a dollar bill. You can 
go through the warp gate to get to another part of the land, and destroy more large creatures. Only 
one of them will have a warp gate in the form of a 'stop' sign - that is your ticket to the round 
boss, but you must defeat all large creatures in order to pass through it. Also like in the original 
can you walk on the ground to avoid approaching enemies, and spend money in the shop to get new 
weapons (but they only last for a limited time).

In year 691 of the celestial calendar, the dimensional control computer "Laxis" ran amok under the 
influence of an unknown interdimensional energy, striking out against mankind. Using its dimensional 
powers, Laxis escaped to another era. Using your dimensional controller-equipped power suit, the 
Arouza, you must hunt down and destroy Laxis. 
 
Starting out in space, you control Arouza, which bears an uncanny resemblance to the metal knights in 
Herzog, as it flies towards the enemy. In the Space Harrier vein, you see your character from behind 
while enemies appear from the horizon. On later stages, set above the planet surface, the resemblance 
is stronger, especially since you can run on the ground. You have two weapon systems, consisting of a 
gun and target-seeking missiles, which have a limited supply. Arouza can be upgraded using powerups 
released when killing certain enemies. Upgrading is a good precaution before you encounter the 
end-of-level bosses, since you only have one life (with a power bar, mind you) to waste.

Hironobu Sakaguchi's Final Fantasy... the first of one of the longest role-playing game series known 
to mankind. Final Fantasy is the game for the NES console that started it all. 
 
The world is veiled in darkness. Winds don't blow, the seas are stormy, and the earth rots. All 
people can hope for is that the ancient prophecy will be finally fulfilled. "When the world is veiled 
in darkness, four warriors will come..." And indeed, they come - the four characters you have 
previously chosen. Their first quest is to free a princess from the evil Garland, and then the real 
journey begins... 
 
Final Fantasy is played with an adventuring party rather than with a single character. Before the 
game starts, the player chooses four characters from six different classes: Fighter, Thief, Black 
Belt, White Mage, Red Mage, and Black Mage. Which four classes the player chooses for his characters 
is entirely up to him. He also gives the characters names. 
 
In the game, the party walks around in a top-down world, visits cities, caves, palaces and other 
places to buy equipment, rest and get hints and new quests, and fights baddies when they are 
encountered. Final Fantasy uses a turn-based combat system

The Flintstones is a game based on the popular cartoon series The Flintstones by Hanna-Barbera 
Productions Inc. 
 
It's weekend! Fred Flintstone thinks of only one thing: bowling 
with his friend and neighbor Barney. 
Unfortunately, his wife Wilma got other plans for him. Fred has to paint the living room and Wilma is 
not going to help him with it. No, she goes shopping. 
And if that's not enough, Wilma also tells Fred that his mother-in-law is coming over. 
 
The Flintstones game is divided in four parts. 
 
Part 1: Painting the walls of your living room. 
To go to the bowling alley before it is closed Fred has to paint  the walls as quickly as possible. 
To paint the walls Fred uses the tail of a living squirrel. 
Pebbles tries to leap out her playpen and starts crawling around and starts scribbling on the walls. 
If Fred wants to put Pebbles back in the playpen then he has to drop the squirrel, that immediately 
starts wandering off. When Pebbles is back in the playpen Fred has to chase the squirrel and dip its 
tail in the paint again. 
 
Part 2: Driving your car on the way to the bowling center. 
Finally, when all walls are painted Fred can go to the bowling 
alley! 
Fred has to drive to the bowling alley but unfortunately the roads are in a very bad condition. The 
road surface is dire and covered with rocks! 
And if one of the wheels hit a bump it will break off the car and disappear into the distance. 
 
Part 3: A bowling competition between Fred and Barney. 
At the bowling alley the following bowling parameters can be set: the spin and speed of the ball and 
the starting position of the player. 
Each turn gives two throws (except he gets a strike). A game 
takes ten turns. while a match takes three games. 
 
Part 4: Saving Pebbles at a construction site. 
On his way home Fred discovers that Pebbles has disappeared!  Don't let Wilma find that out! 
Fred finds Pebbles at a construction site on top of some 
scaffolding. He has to climb the scaffolding to rescue her. 
If Fred fails to rescue his daughter then Barney rescues her and Fred will be branded as a failure!

Football Manager (c) 1987 Addictive Games Ltd / Endurance Games Ltd. 
 
The football management game style has been one of the most enduring since Kevin Toms pioneered it in 
1982. You start in the 4th division with the team of your choice, and can play on indefinitely in the 
hope of reaching the top division and dominating it, as well as winning the cups. Players can be 
bought or sold, with their transfer values varying according to the size of any bid. Their skills and 
morale vary as the season goes on, with resting key players in easy matches often a key move. You can 
take out a loan, limited depending on your division, while day-to-day bills must be covered. Matches 
feature short animated highlights sequences of key moments.

The story of Foxy is rather basic: a hostile army from a country known simply as "Red" attacks the 
capital city of the "Blue" nation. Not only the enemy tries to invade the most important strategic 
points of the city - enemy generals also try to capture and enslave the "Blue" girls! Naturally, they 
must be stopped! As the commander of the Blue army, it's the player's task to face enemy forces in 
battles, rescue the girls, and drive the Reds out of the city. 
 
Foxy is a pure strategy game, without any RPG elements. The player is taken from one battle to 
another

Fray in Magical Adventure (c) 1990 Micro Cabin Corp. / Micro Cabin Corp. 
 
Fray In Magical Adventure is a side-story in the  Xak series. The events of the game are parallel to 
those described in the  second Xak games. The player controls Fray, a young girl whom Latok, the 
protagonist of Xak series, has saved during the events of the  first game. Fray falls in love with 
Latok and decides to prove him that she can be more than just a "damsel in distress". She studies 
magic in a university for three years, and afterwards begins a long journey to find Latok and to help 
him in his battle against evil. 
 
This is a top-down action game, which can be called a shooter of the "run and gun" variety, even 
though it is set in a medieval world. Fray can only use her staff, which works as a ranged weapon, 
casting projectiles. By pressing down the action button, it is possible to increase the size and the 
power of the projected missile. With the exception of towns, the screen scrolls vertically when Fray 
moves forward. Like in most shooters of this type, Fray receives damage when she touches an enemy or 
hit by its projectile attack. Fray visits towns on the way, where she can buy weapons, armor, 
potions, and magical spells.

Freddy Hardest (c) 1987 Dinamic Software / Dinamic Software 
 
The most irreverent playboy of all the galaxy, heir of a great fortune, has a totally irresponsible 
life, given to uncontrolled drunks, endless celebrations and excesses of all kind. After one of his 
last "little" parties he decided to take the controls of his spaceship in not very appropriated 
conditions to pilot, so our sidereal playboy went to play with meteorites under the effects of 
drunkenness. Evidently this diversion could not have finished very well, he crashed with a meteorite, 
lost the control of his spaceship and fell with it to planet Ternat's moon, where it's located the 
enemy base of Kaldar. Injured and laughing, he managed to left the smoky spaceship and slowly noticed 
that in such a place he wouldn't be received in a very friendly way. Already recovered of his dunk, 
Freddy Hardest, who although could not look it, is one of the most intelligent members of the 
Sidereal Free Planet Confederation's SPEA Agency Service of Counterespionage, he must start the 
adventure.

Your task in this arcade conversion is to guide a frog across a treacherous road and river, and to

which will kill the frog and cost you a life if contact is made. 
 
The road is full of cars and trucks, at variable speeds. The river water itself is fatal, as are the 
snakes which hover within on later levels. Frogger must use the arrangement of logs, turtles (which 
are only there for a short time) and alligators (but stay away form their faces), and then jump into 
one of the open home-cells, ideally one containing a fly for extra points. Once all holes have been 
filled, you move onto the next, harder, level.

numerous bad guys out to get him! Frank can defend himself from the bad guys in two ways: he can push 
the apples located throughout the play field on top of the enemies and crush them or Frank can use 
his power ball. This ball can be thrown at an enemy to destroy it. He has only one power ball, 
though, so he will need to wait for it to return to him before it can be used again. 
 
When you successfully collect all of the cherries, you will move on to the next and more challenging 
level. 
 
This game is very similar to the first Mr. Do! game except that in Fruity Frank you don't collect

in which you have a free chance to shoot as many aliens as possible and rack up bonus points. 
 
Certain aliens have tractor beams they can use to capture one of your ships.  If that wasn't your 
last "life," you can try to shoot that alien down and recapture your ship, giving you two ships at 
once and doubling your firepower. 
 
A summary screen appears when the game is over, giving you both your final score and you final "hit

Gaudi: Barcelona no Kaze (c) Jul 28, 1989 Wolf Team / Wolf Team 
 
Gaudi: Barcelona no Kaze was the first adventure developed by  Wolf Team. It takes place in the 
Spanish city of Barcelona, which just the year before the release of the game was chosen for the 
celebration of the 25th Olympic Games. This is important to mention as the game takes place in the 
summer of 1992, the time at which the Olympic Games were being held in Barcelona. 
 
The game is a classic graphical adventure with static images and text, with the occasional appearance 
of small menus that ask you which action you want to execute next. Hard-boiled stories will be 
touching each corner of the most emblematic spaces of the city (which had been digitalized for the 
occasion, with special mention to the monuments designed by Spanish architect Antoni Gaudí). The 
stories have all the elements of a thriller, including terrorist attacks, characters with a dark 
past, romance, crime, etc. all this accompanied by elegant Latin jazz throughout the adventure.

Ghosts, goblins and even the life draining Death are your enemies. Enemies stream out of generators,

Keys are needed to open the many doors within the levels, and in some situations a door will contain 
only bonus items, not a progressive route.  Scattered magic potions act like smart bombs and clear 
the screen of all enemies. Beware of poison though, this reduces your energy level. 
Treasure is abundant throughout the levels and adds to your score.

Humans and aliens are living in harmony in the future, until a tabloid journalist stirs up hatred 
towards aliens. They respond by invading the planet, and it's down to you to clear up a situation 
scarily similar to reality in this arcade conversion. 
 
Gemini Wing is a vertically-scrolling shoot 'em up, which is distinguished by its unusual power-up 
system. Instead of gaining occasional tokens which lead to lasting weaponry improvements, occasional 
flurries of tokens are released to ensure a quick burst of improved fire. The organic backgrounds are

Genghis Khan (1988) (Koei) (c) 1991 Positive / Positive 
 
Genghis Khan is basically a strategy game, but not just. A very important part of your ability as 
governor will depend on your arcade experience when it comes to conquering the territories 
surrounding Mongolia. You mission will be to invade the Chinese Empire, and for that you must tear 
down the Great Wall using gunpowder. 
 
Unfortunately it will not be available from the beginning, so you will have to conquer Baghdad where 
the secrets of gunpowder manufacture are kept, and then dedicate your task in destroying the barrier 
that prevents you from the victory. But it will not be that easy, you will also have to defeat 
several enemies of varying difficulty. 
 
The game makes you choose between arcade, strategy or a mixture of both. In the first category you 
must use the joystick to defeat the owner of the chosen land. The screen turns into a side-scrolling 
game in which a Mongol warrior, sword in hand, must face the enemy hordes. Each soldier you kill 
equalizes to five in total, and every blow you receive means a loss of five units of yours.

Ghostbusters (c) 1985 Activision, Inc. / Activision, Inc. 
 
Based on the movie of the same name, the Ghostbusters are the ones to call who will "bust" any ghost 
hauntings. It does this through the use of nuclear accelerated "proton packs" and traps, whereby the 
ghosts can be captured and transferred to a secure storage facility. However New York City has 
suddenly become a very haunted place, and the number of ghosts has suddenly increased. The 
Ghostbusters must reduce the paranormal (PK) level in the city, representing ghost power, before the 
Temple of Zuul awakens and ressurects an evil goddess, Gozer. 
 
Ghostbusters is an action game that combines an overhead view and a side-view. From Ghostbusters HQ, 
the player must monitor the map of New York City for "ghost alarms" as well as casual spirits, and 
plot a route to the alarmed area. The player then controls the Ghostbuster vehicle as it drives 
through traffic. Here, the player is able to capture casual ghosts on the way if they are en route. 
Once at the location, the game switches to a side-view. Two of the ghostbusters will take position 
and activate their proton beams and toss a trap to the ground. The player will attempt to  maneuver 
the ghost(s) over the placed trap. Once activated, the trap attempts to capture any ghosts directly 
above it. Successful capture will earn the player money, which can then be used to purchase new 
Ghostbusters vehicles and new modifications for the vehicle. Unsuccessful capture will see the ghost 
fly away. 
 
As the game progresses, the PK energy of the city increases. Ghostbusters must keep it under critical 
levels by being constantly  successful at ghost captures. Eventually the Temple of Zuul will 
activate, and if the PK levels are still manageable, the Ghostbusters can venture there for a final 
showdown with Gozer.

Ginga Eiy Densetsu (c) Nov 09, 1989 Bothtec, Inc. / Bothtec, Inc. 
 
This is the first in  Bothtec's  series of games based on Yoshiki Tanaka's science fiction novel 
cycle Legend of the Galactic Heroes. The games are set in the fictional future as depicted in the 
novels: humanity has spread all over the Milky Way, and split into two powerful states which are 
having a permanent war with each other: the Galactic Empire, and the Free Planets Alliance. Two 
genius strategists are leading the forces of their respective states: Reinhard von Müsel for the 
Empire, and Yang Wenli for the Alliance. 
 
The game is dedicated entirely to large-scale strategic battles and is not particularly story-driven. 
There are five different scenarios to choose from, which put the player in control of either Imperial 
or Alliance forces and revolve around "historical" battles based on the novels' lore, with exact 
dates and victory conditions. 
 
The combat takes place between space ships, and is set entirely in outer space. The player usually 
takes control of a "home planet", which is able to deploy a limited number of units. The player then 
navigates the units in turn-based fashion on the top-down map. Enemies typically appear after a few 
turns

Ginga Eiy Densetsu II (c) Dec 23, 1990 Bothtec, Inc. / Bothtec, Inc. 
 
The second game in the  series based on Yoshiki Tanaka's Legend of the Galactic Heroes novels. The 
novels (and the games) are set in a futuristic world, where humanity has conquered the entire Milky 
Way and split into two powerful warring states, each encompassing different systems and planets: the 
Galactic Empire (modeled after Bismark's 19th century Prussia), and the democratic Free Planets 
Alliance. 
 
The game plays very similarly to its  predecessor: the player selects a scenario and tries to fulfill 
the victory requirements it imposes. There are five possible scenarios in the game. Unlike the first 
game, there is an option to choose which space fleet to control (Imperial or Alliance) for each 
scenario. The player takes control of planets allied with the chosen state. It is possible to deploy 
an entire fleet of a planet into the battle, or have it supply separate units. The players navigates 
the units (space ships of different kinds) on the top-down map in turn-based fashion, attacking or 
defending against enemy ships. The ship encounters are automatic and displayed as small animated 
cut-scenes. There are more ship types than the previous game, more different animations during 
battles, and detailed characteristics and portraits for various generals fighting for the two states.

Gingahyry Vifam (c) 1984 
 
Based on Nippon Sunrise's animation series of the eighties, your goal in Vifam is to guide your 
mothership to a specific planet while surviving the assault of enemy robots. 
 
The game is divided into three screens, or monitors: 
Monitor 1 is a two-dimensional starmap, where you guide your ship through the planet system while 
avoiding being pulled into a planet's gravity field. If this happens, the game switches to a screen 
displaying the planet in close-up, and you must immediately accelerate out of its vicinity. The radar 
screen displays both approaching enemy robots and an arrow pointing to your destination. You have a 
limited fuel supply, so time must not be wasted. 
 
If the red dots on your radar come too close, you must switch to monitor 2, where you fly the robot 
Vifam in a first-person perspective through space in order to shoot the enemy down. After that, you 
can return to the mother ship and resume your voyage. Monitor 3 is used for servicing Vifam. 
 
Once you've reached the red planet, the game wraps around and you must do the same voyage again.

Holy Cross – Vanquishes ghosts. 
Sacred Sword – Kills ogres. 
 
Only one magical object may be carried at any one time, and it cannot be dropped. The only way to get

emphasis is therefore on picking up objects in the right order. This can get very tricky not only if 
a monster is in front of a desirable object, but also if it is behind an object which you can't pick 
up or can't use against any enemy within your reach. To complicate matters, many levels contain tiles 
which only allow movement in one direction, so that one can easily get stuck and must forfeit. 
Luckily, the monsters are immobile, so that at least timing is not a variable in the quest for the 
Sangraal. To aid you in your quest, you are given a password every five levels. 
 
This adaptation was made for the MSXdev '05 coding contest.

Guardic (c) 1986 Compile / Compile 
 
Guardic is a top-down 2d shooter based on the classic premise of pitting a single starfighter against 
a horde of enemies with the fate of the galaxy at hand. A particularly interesting touch in Guardic 
is that instead of fighting through a scrolling field filled with enemies, the game places your ship 
in "rooms" with a fixed amount of opponents that take up the most part of the screen. After defeating 
every enemy on screen you advance to the next room and so on... Power ups are not activated until you 
reach the next room (with some exceptions) and even then you have to choose which ones to activate 
before you enter the fight, which gives the game an additional strategic touch.

Gulkave (c) 1986 Compile / Pony Canyon, Inc. 
 
Deviating slightly from Compile's usual vertically scrolling fashion, Gulkave is a rather orthodox 
horizontal shooter. Flying across – or inside – a parallax scrolling landscape, your spaceship must 
singlehandedly take out eight fortresses. In your way stand enemy spaceships that either try to crush 
you or fire at you, as well as some asteroids thrown in for good measure. For each hit you take, your 
ship is not destroyed. Instead, you have a power (barrier) bar that decreases gradually until you 
finally lose a ship. At the end of each level, bonus points are given according to your remaining 
barrier. Losing a ship means you lose all your weapons upgrades as well. As usual with a shooter from 
this maker, the powerups come in the shape of numbered pods that are released from Zanac-style 
blocks. Different upgrades give higher shot counts, more simultaneous bullets or bigger energy waves. 
At certain score intervals, you're granted bonus ships. 
 
The game was released in the eighties for both for the MSX and for Sega's SG-1000 console, the latter 
version having two levels less.

Gun.Smoke (c) 1987 Capcom Co., Ltd. / Topo Soft 
 
Gun.Smoke is a top-down scrolling shooter that casts the gamer as a lone gunman, out to save the 
   gold rush town of Hicksville from a fearsome group of bandits known as the Wingates. Each level 
   has a particular target enemy, although his or her henchmen must also be taken out. 
 
Although it largely takes place on foot, the gameplay resembles Commando, with its top-down action. 
The screen scrolls at a constant rate, and enemies come at you from the edges, to be shot or avoided. 
You can grab various power-ups along the way. Finding a horse will allow you to get hit twice before 
you die rather than just once. There are scenes in which you raft up a river and use the tracks of a 
railway line. 
 
On the NES you can tap the A button to fire up and right, the B button to fire up and left, or A and 
B simultaneously to fire straight ahead. One-button control systems mimic all this.

Guru Logic (c) Dec 30, 2003 Compile / Karoshi Corporation 
 
When Guru Logic Champ was released for the Gameboy Advance, it soon became apparent that the game was 
simple enough in concept to be ported to much simpler systems. One Spanish programmer took it upon 
himself to port the title to the humble MSX1, and released it as part of the MSXdev'03 contest. 
However, he never asked the then-defunct Compile for permission. 
 
The game uses the exact same rules and even the same puzzles as the GBA original, as well as the 
original sprites. The graphics make good use of the limited power of the MSX, with many colours, and 
even renders the player character using multicolour sprites. Due to the limitations in the number of 
sprites that may be displayed, only one duck is responsible for shooting the blocks that fill in the 
picture that is to be completed for each level (the GBA original uses two ducks). While the game 
replicates the original gameplay, it lacks the storyline and does not display a coloured version of 
the completed pictures, something which would not fit into the 32K of memory used by the game. 
Instead, Guru Logic for the MSX1 concentrates on the puzzle gameplay that is central to the game, 
giving a clear impression of what Guru Logic Champ might have looked like had it been conceived ten 
years earlier.

Hacker (1988) (Pony Cannon) (c) 1988 Activision, Inc. / Activision, Inc. 
 
Hacker is an adventure/trading game based on what was then a unique idea. You're starting into the 
adventure as a real hacker would do, lacking information of what is to come, only driven by your 
ambition. Consequently, the game opens with a plain text screen, prompting you for the login 
password. To break into the system is the first puzzle you've got to solve. 
 
Once in, you'll soon find out that you've accidentally stumbled upon a conspiracy of global impact. 
From then on, you'll maneuver a robotic drone around the globe through a tunnel system deep in the 
earth. In major cities, you may surface and talk to contact persons, who'll trade items for cash. 
When delivered to the correct city, you can exchange these items for a piece of evidence. If all 
evidence is collected, you're to inform the FBI. As if figuring out the correct routes and trades 
wasn't hard enough, frequent system malfunctions and security checks test your skill as well...

There is trouble in the mines! Volcanic activity has trapped numerous miners, and it is your job to

dangerous creatures and lava, and find out where the miners are located before you run out of energy. 
To help on your mission, Roderick Hero has several useful types of equipment. A prop pack will allow 
you to hover and fly around the mineshaft and (hopefully) avoid the many dangers within. Your helmet 
features a short range microlaser beam which can be used to destroy the bats, spiders, snakes, and 
other creatures you'll encounter in the mines. From time to time, your path through the mine may be 
blocked by stone or lava walls. You begin each mission with six sticks of dynamite which can be used 
to destroy these obstacles (be careful you don't blow yourself up, though!) If you run out of 
dynamite, your laser beam can also be used to destroy the walls, though this will take longer and use 
up more energy. As the levels progress, the mine shaft will become longer and more maze-like, 
creatures will more frequently block the path, and lava walls and pools will appear which are 
dangerous to the touch.

Herzog (c) 1988 Technosoft Co., Ltd. / Technosoft Co., Ltd. 
 
The first, obscure instalment in the Herzog series is also one of the early precursors of the 
modern-day RTS (real-time strategy game) genre that was popularised by Dune 2. Unlike the common RTS 
game, the playfield is a long vertical stretch instead of the well-known map stretching in both X and 
Y axes. 
 
Another now unique trait is that there is little emphasis on building up a base to produce units 
which are then directly commanded into action. Instead, a base is already located at each end of the 
path, and the player is given control over a hovering battlemech. New units are bought using funds 
accumulated during play. These units, ranging from single foot soldiers to tanks and AA batteries, 
advance from the home base towards the enemy base. The player may pick up a single unit (or five 
soldiers) and move them closer to the enemy base in order to speed up the attack. A radar on the top 
of the screen gives an overlook of the battlefield. 
 
The opposing faction has got the same resources, and the enemy battlemech will make raids towards 
your base, forcing you into mech-on-mech battle. This element turns Herzog into a rather unique blend 
of strategy and shoot'em up. 
 
The game takes place in a balkanised region, where the last war has given birth to a new state, 
called Ruth. A military coup d'état in the now-independent state leads to a new war, which the 
peace-loving Mercies must win.

Hole in One Professional (c) 1986 HAL Laboratory, Inc. / HAL Laboratory, Inc. 
 
This is the second golf game from HAL Laboratory after Hole in One. Like it's predecessor, Hole in 
One Professional is a standard 18-hole golf game, played from a top-down perspective. Players can 
compete in stroke play with up to four players, or match play against a friend or the computer. When 
playing against the computer, the player will play against an opponent that uses metal clubs, which 
hit farther than the standard wooden clubs. 
 
In addition to stroke and match play, players can obtain passwords that allow a replay of any 
spectacular shots that are made (eagles, holes-in-one, and double-eagles).

Hole In One Special (1987) (Hal) (c) 1987 HAL Laboratory, Inc. / HAL Laboratory, Inc. 
 
After the huge success of the first two releases HAL Laboratory released a third golf simulation 
game. Again it is a standard 18-hole golf game, played from a top-down perspective. 
Hole In One Special can be played  up to two players at three difficulty levels: average, expert and 
pro. 
You can compete in stroke play, match play and tournament play. The tournament play can be set at one 
to four days. 
 
During the game the following options can be changed: the direction of the ball, pick a club, set the 
curve of the ball and the stroke power. 
 
The main difference with the other two releases in the Hole In One series for MSX is that Hole In One

Your two best friends Phil and Beverly have been captured by a dark overlord! He is keeping them 
captive in an active volcano, and you need to rescue them. As Howard the Duck, master of Quack Fu, 
you need to make your way through the maze-like landscapes, and jump or fight the many obstacles 
blocking the path using kicks and punches. Water must be navigated around, because this 'superhero' 
duck can't swim. Or fly without the parachute you regularly use. 
 
Quicksand, enemy mutants and more will all get in your way before you can finally parachute into the 
volcano and defeat the dark overlord! Howard the Duck is based on 'Escape From Volcano island', a 
cartoon featuring Howard, but was released to tie in with the movie of the same name.

Humphrey (c) 1988 Made in Spain / Zigurat 
 
Everything began after the opening of the last film of our attractive protagonist. When finalizing 
the projection, everybody was pending of the exit of Humphrey and when this one appeared, well, that 
seemed uncontrollable. 
 
All fans jumped on his back and began to embrace, to kiss, to clear the clothes to him... just a 
little bit and had been the first film actor  attacked in public. 
 
Humphrey finished in hospital with all kind of contusions and a nervous crisis that him left 
postrated in the bed during several months. When he recovered, he changed of house with the intention 
to obtain some privacy and to avoid that they took place more incidents like the one than took to the 
hospital. 
 
But it seems that our friend was nothing lucky. The decorator had painted all the rooms with 
different colors that Humphrey had chosen and that caused certain alteration in his deranged nervous 
system.

Hunchback (c) 1985 Century Electronics / Tomo Soft International 
 
Victor Hugo never could have expected that his creation Quasimodo, the Hunchback of Notre Dame, would 
run such an obstacle course as is dished up in this game, dodging fireballs and arrows while leaping 
over pits and pikemen, sometimes with the help of a swinging bell-pull rope, in hopes of rescuing his 
beloved Esmeralda from the top tower -- all while being slow-but-steady chased across the castle 
parapets by an invincible knight in full armour.  Once you get the hang of any individual obstacle, 
the game starts throwing them at you in tandem, until toward the end you're tracking the swing of the 
rope, the thrust of the lance, the approach of the arrow and the advance of the knight all 
simultaneously!  Succeed, against all odds, and you get to do it again, but faster!  Even an 
able-bodied protagonist would have a hard time juggling all these threats, but I have a feeling a 
dedicated player with patience and good timing can overcome them.  Let's call it a hunch.

Hundra (c) 1988 Zeus Software / Dinamic Software 
 
Jorund, king of the Vikings, and father of our protagonist, has fallen for the deceits of Loki, 
Viking God of the lie. This deceit had as consequence the confinement of Jorund in the kingdom of 
Lukx, from where nobody has ever returned. 
 
Because of this deceit the Viking king has profaned the prohibited garden of the Norns. In there are 
found a great part of the treasure that the Gods keep jealous, as well as some of the nymphs more 
beautiful than ever a human eye has contemplated. 
 
Before such attractiveness, Jorund fell for the deceit of Loki and profaned the garden. The wrath of 
the Gods fell on him and their punishment did not take long: they would border to him to perpetuity 
to the kingdom of Lukx, where their inhabitants would give good account of the bones of our 
protagonist. 
 
But Hundra was not resigned to that her father died in that exile, and therefore, could not reach 
Valhalla, paradise of the viking warriors. 
 
Decided to change the fate of her father, she went to the Viking Mount Olympus where she convinced 
the Gods that her father had been deceived. They admitted their mistake, and saw that the punishment 
had been excessive

Hustle! Chumy (c) 1984 Compile / NISSO Corporation 
 
You are Chumy, the mouse. You live in the sewer, and you are hungry. Luckily, the sewer is filled 
with cheese, only it is guarded by menacing creatures such as rabbits, turtles and bats. 
 
In order to get his cheese, Chumy must go between platforms connected by ladders, all the time 
avoiding the other creatures. Luckily, Chumy can jump very far, across and above the nasties. Chumy 
also has an arsenal of cans to throw at the enemies. Most die after just one hit, whereas others are 
more impervious to attacks. The rabbits are particularly dangerous, since they may pounce at you 
unexpectedly, they being able to jump just as far as Chumy. When Chumy eats cheese (or bombs or 
biscuits), he moves slower due to the extra weight. When the mouse has fed on all the cheese, it can 
take the dust chute down from the top level to the bottom, and make its way to the exit and on to the 
next level. Control Chumy with the cursor keys and X for jumping, C for throwing. 
 
This game has also been included, in a slightly revised form, on Compile's Disk Station #0.

Hydlide II: Shine Of Darkness is a role-playing adventure game and the second installment in the 
Hydlide series. 
 
In a different space a wonderful world existed called Fairy Land which was dominated by swords and 
magic after the times of domination by monsters and evil had ended. The people of Fairy Land were 
intoxicated with peace. 
 
At that time an incident occurred. A Consciousness filled with evil awoke and it created new monsters 
and brought the dead back to life and wanted to dominate Fairy Land again. 
 
The monks were one of the first who noticed this and warned the people about it but they didn't 
listen and left the monks disappointed. 
 
The monks prayed to God and asked Him if there was a Savior. God, impressed by the monks prayers 
warped the space-time of Fairy Land with the human world and selected an innocent boy who lived in 
the human world. 
 
The player controls the innocent boy and must roam the lands of Fairy Land and free it from evil 
while only equipped with a magical sword. 
Attack and defeat evil enemies and gain additional powers. 
In the villages you'll find shops where you can buy and sell items. Start your quest to defeat the 
Evil now.

Swimming involves moving left and right as fast as possible, while pressing fire when a breath is 
required. Skeet shooting and archery both come down to timing - though elevation and wind factors 
affect the latter. Gymnastics involves timing a succession of presses to ensure that the jump is long 
and the landing graceful. The triple jump involves one press for each part of the jump, whereas the 
weightlifting involves merely brute strength.

A young man wakes up, only to find himself in a bed, in an unknown house, in an unknown place. A 
lovely girl enters. She says that her name is Ryuuna and that she is practicing the art of White 
Magic as a priest. However, the young man cannot remember anything. He cannot even remember his own 
name. Ryuuna says that he was found unconscious outside of the village, with a pendant lying nearby. 
There is just one name written there, his name: Seraphis. Also, there is a strange engraving on his 
hand. Who is he really? 
 
Illumina is a rather basic Japanese-style RPG. The party of the heroes walk over the top-down world 
map, visiting towns and descending into dungeons. With a few exceptions, the towns are displayed as 
identically-looking pictures of locations, with menu-based navigation,  Wizardry-style. The random, 
turn-based battles are also first-person, but the dungeons have the same top-down view as the map. 
Playable characters belong to defined classes (such as Ryuuna being a priest with various white magic 
spells that can be leveled up). If any character is killed in a battle, it's Game Over. There are 
several scenes with nudity and sexual situations in the game.

Illusion City - Gen'ei Toshi (c) 1991 Micro Cabin Corp. / Micro Cabin Corp. 
 
In the beginning of 21th century a terrible disaster, that was called "demoncoming crisis", 
devastated the continent of Asia. The city Hong Kong suffered most from the mysterious demonic 
attack. Terrible diseases made the once prosperous city to a ruin. But once people came back to see 
what happened to the isolated city, they saw it was ruled by a new order - a corporation called SIVA. 
The new order proclaimed New Hong Kong to an independent state. PR China and United Kingdom signed an 
agreement in which they both disposed their rights over the city. 
 
You play the role of Tianren, a "diver" (demon-hunter) who lives in Hong Kong. His place of birth and 
the identity of his parents are unknown. Together with a girl named Meihong he was brought up in the 
house of a wise Master. Traveling through the huge city, gathering information and fighting demonic 
forces, Tianren will have to unravel the mystery surrounding the corporation SIVA and the 
supernatural beings from Chinese mythology. 
 
Even though the game is set in an unusual futuristic "urban" environment, it plays like a traditional 
Japanese RPG, with turn-based combat (viewed from an "over-the-shoulder" perspective similar to  
Phantasy Star IV), weapon and armor upgrades, special attacks, etc.

This makes for a four-level arcade adventure combining climbs, exploration (with several routes

foes, but can also get involved in hand-to-hand combat. The first level takes place in caves

The computer versions of Indiana Jones and the Temple of Doom are conversions of the Atari arcade 
game based on the second movie in the series. As Indy you must complete several cycles of the 
following 3 types of levels:Mine level: Whip your way through a mine in order to free children that 
are held captive. Use your whip to swing across chasms, climb ladders, ride along conveyor belts and 
defend yourself against attacks from Thuggee guards, bats, snakes and the fireball-throwing Mola ram. 
Escape with the mine cart after you've freed all children. 
2. Mine cart level: Pick the right route through a network of tracks while riding in a mine cart. 
   Avoid potholes, broken tracks & guards in carts and safely reach the end of the track. 
3. Temple level: Make your way to the altar and grab the Sankara stone while Mola Ram, bats and 
   Thuggee guards attack you. Watch out for that lava. 
With every cycle the mine & mine cart levels become more complex, the layout of the temple levels is 
always the same. After several cycles there's a showdown with Mola Ram on the rope bridge.

In the sequel to The Inheritance: Panic in Las Vegas you've found yourself in Scotland. Your Aunt has 
donated her castle, but alas, you must prove your identity. Your family book is somewhere in this 
castle and "false nephews" are popping up everywhere. What a chaos! 
 
As its predecessor, the game is played in first-person view with point-and-click interface. The 
player moves a cursor in the screen with the ARROW KEYS, and interacts with objects by pressing the 
ACTION key. Inventory is now limited to 4 items and moved to the bottom of the screen. The game now 
consists of single load, but to make it more difficult a percentage of your hungriness is introduced

During the game, you, Mr. Peter Stone, will interact with different persons and collect/use different 
items. Some of your actions may be lethal for the others, but you should also keep your alive and get 
your Inheritance finally.

The Inheritance: Panic in Las Vegas (c) 1987 Infogrames Multimedia SA / Idealogic S.A. 
 
A shady character called Peter Stone receives a telegram from a notary telling that his rich aunt 
passed away in Las Vegas. With the included airplane ticket he must travel to meet the notary and 
arrange the details of the inheritance. 
 
The Inheritance: Panic in Las Vegas is a French adventure game, an early entry in the point-and-click 
sub-genre. The player moves a cursor in the screen with the ARROW KEYS, and interacts with objects by 
pressing the SPACE bar. A handbag in the right side serves as the inventory and can be minimized to 
an icon at the bottom. The game is divided in three loads. At the end of each load, the player 
receives a password for the next one: 
 
?The first load is entitled "In the building", where the player must leave his apartment and go to 
the airport. The airplane leaves at 11:20, and this game section starts at 11:10. Besides this time 
limit, progress is further hindered by the other tenants that appear at each floor. They demand the 
return of borrowed goods. The player can search other apartments, steal money and threaten the other 
residents with weapons (this last option can lead to an instantaneous death). 
 
?"At the airport" is the second load, where the player must embark on the airplane to Las Vegas. 
There is terrorists and other annoyances to be dealt with. 
 
?The final load is called "In Las Vegas", where the player must find the notary, while raising some 
necessary money (a testament clause says that in order to inherit the money Peter has to raise 1 
million dollars by playing games at the casinos).

Strategy games with a real-time movement element didn't begin with Dune 2, and this was one early 
implementation of the concept. Your army has landed on an alien planet and has the intention of 
destroying their weather control station, and ideally as many of their units as possible. 
 
The action is viewed from above, and you use a cursor to direct units, and automatically target and 
attack enemy units. Once you blow up the weather control tower, by exploding at least 2 bombs next to 
it, you must flee the planet ASAP. Protecting all your units is important and requires a tactical 
overview approach, but the bombs are particularly vital.

Isin no Arashi (1989) (Koei) (c) Nov 30, 1989 KOEI Co., Ltd. / KOEI Co., Ltd. 
 
Ishin no Arashi is set during Bakumatsu period (around 1850 until the Meiji Restoration of 1867), the 
final stretch of the Japanese Edo period, which was a turbulent time, a time of great struggle 
between the supporters of the feudal shoguns, the rulers of the country, and the adherents of the 
Emperor, which eventually won and carried through the Meiji Restoration, turning Japan into a modern, 
powerful state. In Ishin no Arashi the player can choose one of the three major battles of Bakumastu 
period, and decide which leader will eventually propel Japan towards the Meiji era. 
 
This strategy game is somewhat similar to the better-known  Romance of the Three Kingdoms series and 
other  historical simulation games by  the same company, but also differs from them by having much 
less complex diplomacy options and focusing the gameplay on navigation and individual encounters. 
Before beginning, the player chooses a general and customizes his parameters (stamina, attack power, 
charisma, knowledge). The player then controls the general with soldiers of his choice, navigating 
him on grids representing towns and countryside of Japan in turn-based fashion. The grids can be 
occupied by shops, schools (to train the general), friendly and hostile characters and groups. 
Battles, as well as negotiations and diplomatic procedures, are carried out automatically, and their 
outcome depends on the characters' statistics.

Jabato (c) 1989 Aventuras AD / Aventuras AD 
 
Jabato is an adventure composed of six parts, each one with its own independent argument, but subtly 
related to the main plot. In each geographic area you will have different problems, interlaced within 
a series of "custom pictures" which gather part of Europe and North  Africa as they were in the first 
century BC. It was the time of the Roman Empire splendor, their legions extend and dominate the known 
world, but in each one of their provinces the inhabitants breathe freedom and make their own rules, 
codes and rituals. In Hispania, Jabato became a legendary figure, prototype of the implacable hero in 
the fight against the evil but with a great heart. In this history you will assume the role of this 
fabulous personage. 
 
But it won't be easy: instead of living one of his moments of greatness, you will incarnate a 
defeated Jabato, without friends, prisoner in a dirty Roman jail with the bitter feeling that his 
beloved Claudia is captive in a distant land. Your final mission will be to avoid that her could be 
sacrificed by the fanatical sect of the Egyptian sub-world. For it, on the first part, you must 
liberate yourself from the Roman yoke and search for company. Multiple adventures are awaiting you 
soon in the Galia and Hispania. The second part begins in Cesarea, in which you must enter in the 
heart of Africa and obtain the keys that could allow you to survive in the lands of the mythical 
tombs, sacred Pharaohs and great mysteries. If you survive, you will fight the final battle against 
the terrible forces of the dark wisdom.

Naughty toddler Jack finds himself in Africa, with the aim of progressing through 192 screens of

The jungle is full of snakes, rhinos, birds and all manner of other creatures, all of which must be 
avoided or killed - remember that their attack paths are pre-programmed, and the trajectory of your 
coconuts is quite limited. Travelling through the levels involves, amongst other things, ladders, 
mine carts, trees, ropes and logs. 
 
As well as simply completing the game and amassing as many points as possible, you can aim to be as 
naughty as possible, which is gauged by a 'Naughty-O-Meter' next to the score, with numerous objects 
available for that purpose (one can be carried at a time, alongside one weapon).

Jagur 5 (c) 1987 Compile / Hudson Soft Company, Ltd. 
 
Jagur: Golden Triangle is something as unusual as a cross between Commando and an action RPG such as 
Ys or Hydlide. 
 
You start out with your character Jef jumping off a boat somewhere in the Golden Triangle between 
Laos, Burma and Thailand, presumably to fight drug lords. A typical Commando or Ikari-styled mission. 
The town Jef enters is inhabited by gangsters of all kinds who shoot at you. Thankfully, some of the 
locals are quite friendly, offering to sell you drugs (of the medical kind?), food or even weapons. 
Other offer you vital information. The clues you are given lead you to the right house, where you may 
find a friend who has previously been captured. Your quest is then to find the right bribe for your 
mate to be released. The puzzles begin in the simplest fashion, so as not to interfere with the 
action aspects of the game. Soon, all five members of the team are gathered, and the quest may go on 
farther into the triangle, where opposition will be fiercer and the puzzles harder. Thankfully, slain 
enemies will often drop munitions or money, so that you may keep your arsenal updated and your team 
alive, not to mention bribing the right people. 
 
Though featuring a lot of action, Jagur 5 has enough RPG emphasis to actually have an experience 
meter. A strategic element involves choosing the right team leader and the right formation to handle 
different tasks. Instead of magic spells, bombs, grenades or bazookas are used, and medical supplies 
replace magic potions, making Jagur 5 one of few RPGs which don't involve magic, though it may not 
count as a proper RPG in everyone's eyes.

D.C. Connection, the third entry in the  J.B. Harold Series, is - perhaps not very surprisingly -

  disappeared, the private investigator J.B. Harold decides that he must investigate the case on his 
  own, without trusting the authorities...

talking to people, questioning suspects, searching apartments, and generally gathering clues. The 
progress of the investigation can be reviewed in the hotel where the J.B. Harold is staying.

A 24-year-old woman was found dead in her flat in Manhattan, New York. Her skull was crushed - it was 
clear that she was murdered. Further investigation showed that she was working as a pianist. The 
police can find no clues, so it's time for the private detective  J.B. Harold to investigate the 
murder and to bring the killer to justice. 
 
Despite its Japanese origins, Manhattan Requiem has realistic graphic design without any manga/anime 
influences. As an adventure game, it has Japanese influences (no inventory, no puzzles), as well as 
Western ones (relative freedom in navigation, detailed dialogue system, no "trigger commands" to 
advance the plot). The game plays similarly to a real investigation: the player has to question 
suspects, collect evidence, find new leads, after which new locations become accessible. It is also 
possible to review all the data collected during the investigation in-game, by going to a bar at any 
time.

Joker (c) Jan 14, 1992 Birdy Soft / Birdy Soft 
 
Joker is set in the time period commonly known as the "Old West" or "Wild West" in the United States 
of America. The protagonist of the game is a young man nicknamed Wild, who lives in a quiet Native 
American village. Years ago, the village was hit by something its inhabitants have since called "The 
Great Disaster". In order to seal the forces that caused the catastrophe, Wild's father sacrificed 
his own life. Now, the ceremonial day of the White Magic approaches. The youngest in the line of 
witches, a girl named Laura, must predict the future for the village and the world. For an unknown 
reason, Laura is unable to see into the future. Concerned, the village elder sends Wild on a mission 
to the nearby town, to find out what could cause this and if there is a way to prevent the Great 
Disaster from returning... 
 
Joker is essentially a Japanese-style adventure, with strictly menu-based interface, still screens 
viewed from first-person perspective, and no real puzzles. However, the game offers more interaction 
possibilities and less linear progression than it is usually the case in comparable games. The player 
must explore the town and talk to its inhabitants in order to advance the story and get to the bottom 
of the mystery. 
 
The game has scenes with nudity and rather mild depictions of sexual situations.

Joker II (c) Sep 04, 1992 Birdy Soft / Birdy Soft 
 
Joker II continues the story that started in  Joker. In the end of the first game, the young hero 
Wild had to confront the sorceress Claudia, who intended to resurrect the evil Joker, which caused 
what the Native Americans of the region called "The Great Disaster". Six months have passed since the 
tragic outcome of those events. Wild is taken care by his friends and companions. The same nightmare 
pursues him: he sees his sweetheart Laura calling for him, begging him to save her... Wild has to 
rebuild his life from scratch, but this nightmare ties him to his past... so he ventures out to look 
for answers once again. 
 
Gameplay-wise, Joker II is pretty much identical to its predecessor. It is a Japanese-style adventure 
without puzzles, but with more interaction and exploration possibilities than it is usually the case 
with games of its genre. Graphically the game also looks very similarly

Jump (c) 1992 Zigurat / Zigurat 
 
This arcade game is a cross between Breakout and Space Invaders. Player controls an electromechanical 
robot, who walks along the top of a wall consisting of bricks and jumps on it. A line of bugs is 
coming to him from the bottom of the screen in vertical direction, while the bomb is flying in 
horizontal direction in the center. Bugs may be killed by jumping on the wall, which results in a 
brick falling from its bottom. The number of jumps is equal to the bottom brick's distance from the 
robot. Flying bomb may eliminate the brick until it reaches the bug, but if the bug is killed, its 
bad or good soul will fly to the top, where robot may collect it and make influence on his mood. 
After the bug is eliminated, another one will start to crawl from the bottom. There is a snail moving 
in horizontal direction at the very bottom of the screen, which is mostly covered by the bugs 
crawling to the top, and it may be hit by brick in case of success also. 
 
The player is transferred to another level after necessary quantity of the bugs is killed. But 
beware! Robot's energy is exhausted, when bug is crawling upon him, and the robot becomes 
non-functional if the bugs reached the very top of the screen or if the robot falls off the wall.

The notorious thief Harry Hooligan is on the loose! You play the part of Officer Keystone Kelly, sent 
in to capture Harry. Harry is trapped in a four story mall, and is running as fast as he can to reach 
the exit at the top. Your job is to catch up to him and send him to prison. You will need to use 
either the escalators at the end of each floor, or the elevator in the middle to go from floor to 
floor. The escalators may be further away, but the elevator moves pretty slowly so you will need to 
decide which route will be faster in getting you closer to your goal. If Harry can make it to the top 
before you catch him, you will have to retry that level. Harry has no intention of letting you catch 
him easily, and is hurling everything he can find in an attempt to slow you down. Shopping carts, 
bouncing balls, biplanes, and more will all be flying past on the screen and will either slow you 
down or send you back to the beginning if you get hit. As the levels progress, Harry will run faster 
and faster, and more objects will be tossed your way to duck and jump over.

shields (to increase defense), boots (to increase speed), swords (to increase attack power), and 
spell icons (which will be required to be held by everyone for the final storm on the castle), 
defeating monsters along the way. The power-ups are hidden underneath mountains, rocks, and houses. 
Nearly everything can be shot at and destroyed. The heroes are, in order:

with most Ultimate titles of the day, reaching him is a long and treacherous challenge, involving 
both puzzle-solving and action, meaning that each screen requires thorough planning and precise 
navigation. 
 
The game uses the isometric viewpoint in a manner similar to the later Head Over Heels, using 
monochrome but detailed graphics and techniques to avoid flickering sprites. The game lasts for 40 
days and nights - at night your character turns into a werewolf. Ultimate's individual style of 
eschewing straightforward instuctions in favour of feature lists and riddles is put to good use here, 
with the story detailed in a rhyming poem of sorts.

marking the ones already visited and displaying icons of the objects on each screen. The map can be 
called with the SHIFT key. When used on a MSX Turbo R, the game activates the R800 CPU to prevent 
slowdowns. 
 
The gameplay remains the same, where the player must guide the explorer Sabreman through a castle 
labyrinth, collecting all the ingredients for a potion spell. The daytime cycle occurs every few 
minutes, turning the main character into a werewolf when the evening starts, and back to human form 
when the dawn breaks. The remake has a darker, colder palette for night time. The quest must be 
completed in 40 days, roughly an hour of real time, to win the game and cure Sabreman of lycanthropy.

Knightmare II: The Maze of Galious (c) 1987 Konami Industry Co. Ltd. / Konami Industry Co. Ltd. 
 
Knightmare II: The Maze of Galious is the sequel of another Konami game called Knightmare. 
 
Maze of Galious is a game where you have to kill thousands of enemies, collect items in order to 
obtain new powers, and defeat some really big guys at the end of each level. In Maze of Galious you 
are free to go everywhere you want from the beginning of the game, thus you have to choose very 
carefully the order in which you visit all the rooms in the huge map if you want to keep your 
character alive. 
 
The map is structured in a main map (called the Castle) and 10 submaps (called the Worlds). Initially 
you are in the Castle, and you have to find the keys that open the doors to go to each of the Worlds. 
To complete the game, you have to defeat the boss at the end of each one of the 10 worlds. You are 
free to revisit each world as often as you want, in order to see if you have missed something. To 
defeat all 10 beasts, you control two characters: Popolon and Aphrodite. Each one has special 
abilities, i.e. Popolon has a greater ability to jump and Aphrodite is able to dive.

Knight Tyme (c) 1986 Mastertronic Ltd. / Mastertronic Ltd. 
 
After rescuing the wizard Gimbal, the Magic Knight finds himself transported into the 25th century 
aboard the peaceful trade starship USS Pisces. He must find a way back to his own time. 
 
Knight Tyme is the third game of the Magic Knight series. As in Spellbound, the previous game, the 
player interacts with the environment through the "Windimation" system: pressing a button brings up a 
window with a list of commands (pick up/drop/take/give an object, examine, command a character, read 
something, cast a spell and wear/unwear object). The player can scroll through these with the 
movement keys, and execute them with the same button used before. Spaceflight is part of the gameplay 
as the ship must visit several different planets. The spaceship has to be refueled, otherwise the 
character will be stuck forever in space. There are rooms that kill the knight instantaneously. 
Usually there is a puzzle associated with these rooms that must be solved in order to access them.

party in Professor Tsukishima's mansion. The hero becomes acquainted with the professor's young 
daughter, and her father eventually hires him as a private tutor. But it all goes wrong when a 
terrible accident involves the young hero into a net of mystery and intrigues. Soon he realizes that 
an innocent person's life might be in danger. The private tutor becomes a private detective... 
 
Kurutta Kajitsu is a rather standard Japanese-style adventure gameplay-wise. Typically for the genre, 
the player advances the story by repeatedly selecting verb commands ("Examine", "Talk", etc.) from a 
menu. Most of the time the player is free to move between various locations (also menu-wise) to 
explore the game world, talk to characters, and solve the mystery. The game has scenes with nudity

mysterious land in which legends say there are a lot of dangers, hidden treasures, unsolved 
mysteries, temples filled with traps... in short, the ingredients to which the good adventurer is 
used to deal with. 
 
The adventure is developed in the island of Cozumel, where you must guide an archaeologist who had an 
incident. He was sailing towards it perfectly equipped, when an unfortunate shipwreck left him 
without anything. Do not think he only lost the map or the machete, no, he lost everything, including 
the trousers and the underclothes, reason why it's quite possible that an entrance in San Marcos, 
coastal town near the place of the shipwreck, would carry serious problems with the justice. The main 
mission of the adventure is to discover all the hidden secrets of the island and then be able to 
escape from it. 
 
This game uses the habitual commands of the previous AD adventures, plus the inclusion of some PSI 
characters, it means, personages with own personality, decision capacity, different behavior 
according to the development of the adventure, that is, personages who must be treated as if they 
were real since their reactions can vary from a game to another. Some improvements like the objects 
treatment system have been incorporated (which include all their qualities)

You control a tank-like robot which can be divided in 
two: you rotate caterpillar and head-canyon, and the head part can fly off on its own. However,the 
head can only survive separately for a short amount of time, and your restart position is dictated by 
the location of the body, even if the head has moved forward through further screens. Therefore, the 
difficulty of the game was in making it possible to advance with the assembled robot's two parts.

Lazer Bykes (c) 1985 
 
This is one of those Tron-style games where you and an opponent, either human or computer-controled, 
ride light cycles in an arena. This is very much like a "snake" game, but where the tail never ends, 
forcing you to go on as long as possible, trying to trap your opponent with your "tail". This 
particular version is played until either version has died ten times, has optional obstacles and two 
speeds.

Welcome to the World of Lazy Jones. You play the role of a janitor in this game, a lazy janitor that 
sneaks into back rooms and plays computer games. You can move around from floor to floor, and go into 
the back rooms and play the old (and I mean old) computer games that are in these rooms. Be careful 
you wouldn't want to get caught by security guards that are roaming the floors. There are 18 rooms to 
choose from, there are 3 that actually aren't games, and of course everyones favorite, the one that 
isn't a classic game, but you are just trying to get drinks off of the bartender, while avoiding the 
drunk.

Legacy of the Wizard (c) 1987 Nihon Falcom Corp.|Quintet Co., Ltd. / Nihon Falcom Corp. 
 
Long ago, an evil dragon named Keela was imprisoned inside a magical dungeon. However time has passed 
and the magic that sealed the dragon away is weakening. The Drasle family decides that it's time to 
destroy the dragon once and for all. However only one weapon is capable of doing this, the Dragon 
Slayer, which is itself sealed away by four magical crowns. The Drasle family decides to take on this 
quest, and will use every member of the family in order to accomplish it. 
 
Legacy of the Wizard is an side-scrolling action platform game with role-playing elements.  The 
player chooses a character from among five different members of the Drasle family. The choices are: 
Xemm the father and woodcutter, Mayna the magic-using mother, Roas the brave warrior son, Lyll the 
athletic daughter and Pochi the domesticated monster-pet. Each character has unique abilities 
(including attack and jumping abilities) and can only use certain items from those collected. Players 
can travel back to the Drasle household at any point to change characters. 
 
The object of the game is to enter the large dungeon, itself divided into 5 areas, collecting a 
variety of items (which as mentioned, can only be used by particular characters) and use them to 
progress through the dungeon, defeating monsters. Power-ups dropped by monsters include gold, keys, 
health-restoring bread, magic-resoring potions and health-damaging poison. Gold can be spent on items 
and other power-ups that are available at various shops hidden inside the dungeon. The player must 
eventually defeat the four bosses guarding the crowns that seal the Dragon Slayer and then use that 
weapon to defeat the Kress.

Leisure Genius presents Monopoly (c) 1986 
 
This version of the classic board game supports several graphic formats and offers some different 
options. From 2 to 8 players can play the game, and they can all be computer players if you wish. 
This allows you to just sit back and watch as the computer takes over.  You can choose to play a 
short game with a specified time limit, or a standard game, and there is a save game feature. 
 
All actions are handled entirely by keyboard. Questions appear in the center area of the board (for 
buying property, for instance). Pressing the first letter of a word from the top bar takes that 
action (Q for Quit as an example). Player stats can be viewed on the screen.

Life in the Fast Lane (c) 1987 The Bytebusters / Method Solutions LLC 
 
Life in the Fast Lane can best be described as a cross between Trailblazer, for its bouncy ball on a 
chequered path action, and Elektraglide for its twisty road and futuristic enemies and obstacles. 
 
Your task is simple: Travel as far as you can on the road inside your rolling sphere. There are 
obstacles in the road that you must avoid, either by going to the left or right or by jumping over 
them. Unlike Trailblazer, you can jump a whole lot, even to the point of virtually flying above the 
level. Not even then are you safe, though, since airplanes will attack you in the sky. 
 
The ground has holes in it. If you miscalculate a leap, and fall into a black hole, you are dropped 
into something very much like Tempest, with your sphere moving across the outer edge of a space 
tunnel, shooting at the things that come out of it. If you fall into a water-filled hole, you fall 
through the road and find that it runs above a river. Here, you are attacked by fish, but luckily you 
can shoot back at them (something you cannot do on the ground). The next time there is a whole in the 
ground, you have a chance to resurface. All the while, you must make sure not to expend your jumping 
and shooting power bars, or you will be left vulnerable.

The aim of the game is to guide a ball through 50 levels of walls, barriers and general obstacles. 
You control a bat, which must 'serve' the ball into play, and then follow it through the level, 
deflecting it before it falls behind you, as this costs you one of your 4 lives. Initially the 
obstacles are all static, but moving barriers add timing, reactions and luck to proceedings. 
 
There are also several bonus objects, which are collected by passing through them. These include an L 
for an extra ball and dual rectangles to give you a second bat which moves around at random. 
 
The game also comes with a full level editor, allowing you to design new levels and save them to tape 
or disk.

ladders and ropes. 
 
The Empire has sent robotic guards down to protect the gold, and contact with any of these will cost 
you a life. Your method of escaping them is to press fire to dig a hole in their line of movement, 
thus causing them to fall in briefly, allowing you to move across the gap safely. Once all the gold 
has been collected, a ladder allowing you to move onto the next screen is added. Completing these 
screens often requires forward planning and precision.

The game has five pits: Out, 0 points, 10 points, 30 points and 50 points. 
 
Each level starts by giving you a target score that you'll have to reach before you continue to the

The screen is divided into sixteen sections. The walls of those sections randomly disappear and the 
balls will then drop or roll into the other section or a pit at the bottom of the screen. 
 
On the screen you will find two arrows of which the second arrow follows the first one but with a 
slight delay and it stops at the same position as the first one. 
 
The arrows will start in an empty section of which one of the walls will soon disappear. To move the 
balls to the empty section move your first arrow to a section that is filled with balls end press the 
space bar or fire button. The balls will then be moved to the empty section. 
If both sections contain balls then the balls will be swapped accordingly. 
 
Now you have to manipulate the balls in such a way that they will generating points by getting them 
to the pits that generate points. 
 
In the bottom left of the screen there is a section that has a thin red line at the bottom. Never 
move the balls in that section because if any balls enter that section a crab will appear and cut the 
red line with it's razor sharp claws. The balls will disappear in the pit labeled 'OUT' and you loose

A single classical-style pinball table is provided in this simulation. A table editor is also 
provided - this allows you to choose a shape for the table and arrange the component parts as you 
wish. Up to four players can take it in turns, each with five balls in turn. 
 
Unusually, the default table has multiple flippers at the bottom of the table, as well as some 
located higher up. Use them to return a ball higher on table and to prevent it being lost at the 
bottom of the table. Hitting some valuable areas of table gives you a bonus. Gain as many points as 
possible to rack up a high score.

This game is a ripoff of the classic arcade game Burgertime. You are a hamburger chef and you're out 
to build delicious hamburgers. As you run through the colorful maze assembling the ingredients, there 
is nothing that can stop you. Except maybe the menacing egg, hot dog and pickles that are out to ruin 
the meal! You can bury them under beef patties, lettuce and buns. Or, knock them out with pepper. To 
complete a level you have to build four burgers.

Mad Mix is a Pac-Man variant, with a typical bird's eye view for each level and pellets you must eat 
in order to get to the next stages. Navigate the maze you're trapped in and gobble up food while 
trying to avoid the ghosts that are chasing you. 
 
As a Pac-Man variant, there are some changes made to distinguish itself. Some levels offer 
transformative powers. These include being turned into a hippopotamus - which allows you to step on 
ghosts - and a vacuum cleaner - to clean up pellets corrupted by a wandering enemy. On some levels, 
you can also briefly turn the protagonist into a spaceship or a tank, where you can shoot ghosts from 
a fixed vantage point. 
 
As with most arcade titles at the time, there is no true ending

Mad Mix 2: En el castillo de los fantasmas (c) 1990 Topo Soft / Topo Soft 
 
Peace had arrived finally at "Cocovillage" thanks to the good work made by Mad Mix, who had become 
the worthy successor of his grandfather. But the nightmare had still not finished, because a few 
miles away, in the town of his cousin Ope, "Cococastle" (a place crowned by a phantasmagoric Castle), 
it was happening a strange phenomena. All the indications made think that a "coco", survivor of 
"Cocovillage", had converted the Castle into his dwelling, establishing in addition a maleficent 
alliance with the sinister inhabitants from that place. The terror had seized the inhabitants of 
"Cococastle", and only Mad can give back the tranquillity to the pacific inhabitants of this village. 
 
The game consists in eating all the "coconuts" (small ball species that are dispersed through all the 
Castle) which appear at every moment. Once you have finished with all the coconuts of the level you 
will pass to the following stay of the Castle of the Ghosts, this is the mechanic until you have been 
able to explore all its corners. However, you shouldn't care only in eating all the "coconuts", but 
in addition you will have to be very kind trying to not collide with any of the inhabitants of the 
terrific Castle, as well as to avoid the different traps (or using them in your own benefit) while 
taking helpful -some with really curious effects- objects.

Mad Monogatari 1-2-3 (c) Jun 15, 1990 Compile / Compile 
 
A three-chapter first person RPG that chronicles the adventures of the young apprentice sorceress 
Arle Nadja with all three chapters made as independent games but released under a single package. The 
first game starts as the little Arle attempts to graduate from her magic school by conquering the 
evil Satan tower. The second game jumps forward in time to a 16-year old Arle, now an accomplished 
magician, who must escape a dungeon and defeat those that imprisoned her. 
The third and final game in the package faces Arle off against an evil sorceress that aims to avenge 
the deeds Arle did on Satan tower back in the first game. She must now escape a dungeon and defeat 
the evil minotaur that has been sent to destroy her. 
 
All three games share the same engine and gameplay mechanics, playing as first-person RPGs in which 
your main view is composed of a 2.5D view of the dungeons you are trapped in, and the rest of the 
interface is used to give graphic feedback to the player instead of relying on stats and numbers (for 
instance, a picture of Arle serves as the means of telling how damaged she is, and a group of gems 
that encircle the screen show how closer you are to advancing a level). Combat is real-time and 
involves selecting and casting spells to obliterate the many baddies in the dungeon. There's also a 
fair amount of puzzle solving and plenty of NPCs to run across in each dungeon, all being characters 
from the Puyo Puyo series.

Maison Ikkoku (1987) (Micro Cabin) (c) 1988 Micro Cabin Corp. / Micro Cabin Corp. 
 
The game is based on the manga Maison Ikkoku by Rumiko Takahashi. 
 
Set in Tokyo of the 80-ies, the story can be described as a romantic tale with a touch of comedy. It 
centers on a boarding house which is managed by the young and lovely widow Kyoko Otonashi. The 
protagonist is a college student named Yusaki Godai, and his relationship with Kyoko is the main plot 
line. The game's story approximately corresponds to the middle volumes of the manga until the 
conclusion. 
 
The game is a "puzzle-less" adventure, the gameplay mostly focusing on simply depleting all the verb 
commands at every given screen and moving between locations. The commands include the usual "Look", 
"Talk", and Move" typical for Japanese adventures (no "Think" command), but also context-sensitive 
commands "Eat", "Drink", etc., as well as the possibility to use certain inventory items.

Malaika: Prehistoric Quest (c) Dec 31, 2006 Karoshi Corporation / Karoshi Corporation 
 
One day, a young cave princess called Malaika comes back from a visit to her relatives, only to find 
that all inhabitants of her village are gone. The villagers have been turned into energy crystals by 
aliens from the future, who plan to use Malaika's fellows as fuel for their machines. Malaika sets 
out to rescue her friends and put a stop to the aliens' plans. 
 
You control Malaika in a basic platform game, playing like a cross between Super Mario Bros and the 
original Wonder Boy, but without any offensive weapons. The mainstay of the enemies are coloured 
blobs, most of which disappear when you jump on them. The purple blobs are more dangerous, since they 
can electrocute Malaika if she jumps on them at the wrong time. Other enemies are flying blobs and 
Super Mario-style cannons. 
 
When you jump on an enemy, you bounce just a little bit higher than a normal jump. Using this 
effectively means that Malaika can reach high-up places which would otherwise remain inaccessible. 
 
Powerups are available in the shape of stars which will render Malaika invincible for a short time, 
just like in Mario, and extra lives. Malaika does not die on first contact with an enemy, since you 
have a graded system of three hearts which are expended when you touch an enemy. Hearts can also be 
found at some points to restore your health. Spread throughout the levels are the small crystals that 
used to be friendly cavepeople. Clearing a level with 100 or more crystals will give you bonus 
points. There are six worlds to clear, each made up of four levels. Each world has an end-of-level 
boss to beat. 
 
This game was made for the 2006 edition of the MSXdev coding contest.

Mandragore (c) 1986 Infogrames Multimedia SA / Infogrames Multimedia SA 
 
Mandragore is a role playing adventure game that was originally released in France. 
 
The kingdom was at peace under King Jorian. When he was killed in a freak accident that peace was 
shattered as Lord Yarod-Nor took control and began a reign of tyranny and evil. The player leads a 
party of four characters (with the option to either define your own characters or take a  predefined 
group) through the land to eventually challenge, confront and defeat Yarod-Nor in his own castle. 
Before that can be done the group must explore nine chateaux each of which contains a problem and 
clues that are useful later in the game, battle assorted and unusual monsters, enter villages to 
trade, and develop your characters skills. 
 
The four predefined characters are 
 
1. Syrela : a human female minstrel, 
2. Podus : a male dwarf thief, 
3. Gelth : a male elf wizard, and 
4. Torlin : a male mi-orc ranger 
 
Each character has values for the following attributes, constitution, strength, knowledge, wisdom, 
dexterity, and appearance. When creating your own characters there is a maximum of 80 points can be 
assigned to these attributes with none having more than 20 points or less than 5. 
 
Character control is unusual and consists of abbreviated commands. The whole party moves as a single 
unit so to move North, South, East or West the player just has to type N, s, E, or W. 
When the party comes on an enemy the commands take the form 
 
1. character : each character in the party is referred to by a number in the range 1 - 4 
5. command : only the first two characters need to be typed 
6. target : objects and enemies are referred to by letter 
 
So when a monster is encountered typing 3 will select Gelth, typing AT will command Gelth to ATtack, 
and typing A will instruct Gelth to attack the first target. When the party acquires weapons it is 
possible to extend the command to specify the weapon to be used.

Master of Monsters (c) 1989 SystemSoft / SystemSoft 
 
Master of Monsters is a turn-based strategy game in which you choose one of five different wizards 
and fight the other wizards for domination of the land that stands without a ruler  after the master 
wizard's death. You can play in two campaigns against the computer which requires you to defeat the 
enemy wizards on all maps and allows you to take all units that have survived a battle into the next 
one. You can also play all maps individually with up two four human players. In battles, you can 
summon different monsters and cast spells. Which monsters you can summon and which spells you can use 
depends on which wizard you have chosen. Your aim in every battle is to defeat all other wizards and 
thus conquering the land (In the campaigns you only have a limited number of turns to do so). Your 
wizard and monsters gain experience from fighting and your monsters' abilities differ largely from 
one-another. For example some monsters can execute long-range attacks, some have strong magic attacks 
but are physically weak. Furthermore, their movement is affected by different terrain types. While 
flying monsters can move freely, most of the other monster have a preferred terrain type (lizards 
move best in water etc.). You can summon up two 30 monsters per battle, but how many monsters you can 
summon each turn is not only determined by the amount of MP, but also by the number of towers that 
you control, which makes conquering and defending towers a key-element in battles.

Maziacs (c) 1985 dk'tronics / dk'tronics 
 
Maziacs is a maze game. The maze in Maziacs has no edges but has around 100 locations and a new maze 
is generated at each game start. The aim of Maziacs is to find the treasure and take it to the point 
the game started. 
 
All scattered over the maze are prisoners, food, swords and treasures for you to collect but you are 
chased by monsters that will attack you. 
 
A sword can only kill one Maziac, a hostile and horrible monster and it's only possible to carry one 
item at the time. Without a sword, you can still fight Maziacs, but your chances of victory are much 
lower. 
 
You need to collect food or you will die of starvation. 
 
To find the treasure you should ask the prisoners who can show you the way, but only for a short 
distance. The route will turn yellow for a short time. 
 
The prisoners will also tell you the way back to your starting point. 
As you can only carry one item at the time it is best to kill as many Maziacs on your way to the 
treasure.

Mecha Taisen on Planet Oldskool (c) Dec 31, 2006 Damage X / Damage X 
 
As you can guess by the name, this is a derivate of Banpresto's and Winky Soft's famous Super Robot 
Taisen series. 
 
Since this is created for the MSX1, it is close in its presentation to the original 8-bit Robot 
Taisen series, but cut down to 48 kilobytes. This means that animations are removed from the battle 
scenes. As the game takes place on Planet Oldskool, your units are all named after famous chips in 
computers such as the Z80, the 6502 or the SID. Since it's an MSX game, all the heroes are chips 
found in that computer. "Grunts" are DRAM chips, such as the 4164 and the bigger 41256. Even though 
the units are integrated circuits, they are represented in the game by giant robots, whose graphics 
seem to be ripped straight out of the original Super Robot Taisen. 
 
In this turn-based strategy game, you move your units across the varying terrain, and launch an 
attack if possible. All units have ballistic weapons with a certain range, as well as close combat 
weapons which may only be used against enemy units on directly adjacent squares. You must weigh in 
the power of the weapon, its accuracy as well as remaining ammunition when launching an attack. After 
all your units have moved, it's the enemy movement phase. Since different units have different 
weapons, speed and range, they must be arranged in a formation that makes for effective tactics – 
artillery in the back and speedy units close the front to draw enemy fire. Veteran units level up 
just as in an RPG. 
 
After completing each stage, you are given a cash bonus with which to upgrade your units. At the 
beginning of each stage, another unit is added to your army, reflecting the evolution of the MSX 
system. In the six levels, you must face the chips of the C64, the Atari, the 80286 and the 80386.

Mega Phoenix (c) 1991 Creepsoft / Dinamic Software 
 
Mega Phoenix brings the concept of the earlier arcade game Phoenix into the 90s, to the extent that a 
coin-op version was later made by Gaelco. The game is a single-screen shoot ‘em up in which the 
player moves left to right while shooting several waves. There is a shield function available, which 
lasts for a short period of time (after which it must recharge to be used again) and it paralyses the 
craft while active. 
 
The first waves consist of several small alien beings in a set pattern, which move down from the 
fleet towards the player at random intervals- contacts with these kills the player. Deadly phoenixes 
firing at you come next, followed by the Mega Phoenix itself and then a final boss, before it all 
repeats with higher difficulty.

Metal Gear 1 (1987) (Konami) (c) Jul 07, 1987 Konami Industry Co. Ltd. / Konami Industry Co. Ltd. 
 
Near the end of the 20th century, a small fortified nation named Outer Heaven (founded by a 
mysterious war hero whose name and identity are shrouded in secrecy) is threatening the nations of 
the "West" with the development of a new prototype weapon named Metal Gear, a walking tank which is 
capable of launching nuclear warheads from anywhere on the globe. As FOX-HOUND's (an elite black ops 
unit) newest recruit, going by the codename of Solid Snake, your mission is to infiltrate Outer 
Heaven and rescue your missing comrade, Grey Fox (who was captured after a failed infiltration), 
while gathering intelligence on Metal Gear. In order to fulfill your objective, you must collect 
various weapons and equipments (including keycards for further access into the fortress), while 
avoiding visual contact with the enemy. The player must also confront against bosses in the form of 
Outer Heaven's elite mercenary force and rescue hostages hidden within the fortress in order to 
increase their rank, which gives the player an extended life bar and increased storage capacity for 
replenishable items and ammo. The player can use a wireless transceiver to come in touch with their 
commanding officer, Big Boss, to learn more about their current mission objectives or contact one of 
the local resistance members operating covertly within the fortress to gain useful tips and insights.

Metal Gear 2 - Solid Snake (1990) (Konami) (c) Jul 20, 1990 Konami Industry Co. Ltd. / Konami 
Industry Co. Ltd. 
 
In 1999, a great scientist named Kio Marv invented "oilix", a special petroleum-purifying substance 
that was supposed to help in the upcoming oil crisis. Shortly after the invention became known in the 
world, Dr. Marv was abducted. An investigation showed that he was held captive in Zanzibar Land, an 
isolated state in Central Asia which was ruled by a group of mercenaries from all around the world. 
Having oilix in addition to nuclear weapons are bound to Zanzibar an invincible state that would 
sooner or later attempt to conquer the entire world. Roy Campbell, ex-commander of special unit 
FOXHOUND, sends Solid Snake, the man who has single-handedly brought down the military nation of 
Outer Heaven four years ago, on a mission to infiltrate Zanzibar and to bring back the scientist and 
his invention. 
 
Like its predecessor, Metal Gear 2: Solid Snake is a stealth game. The driving element of the 
gameplay is to stay unnoticed. If guards spot you, you don't have much chance in combat, unless you 
are armed with appropriate weapons, which aren't easily acquired. Snake can use a variety of weapons 
and gadgets to help him survive during his mission. He can also hide behind objects, punch guards, 
and crawl. From time to time he'll have to participate in boss battles, where stealth won't help any 
more.

When the epic, thousand-year-old battle between different dragon clans was finally over, and the 
benevolent White Dragons started ruling the country of Akranis, it looked like the age of peace has 
finally arrived. But all changes when the dragon rider Kain finds an ancient weapon known as the Rune 
Blade. He brings it to the old white dragon Yoshua, who tells him that a powerful protective artifact 
has been stolen, and the fateful hour has come to Akranis... with the help of his dragon Sarken, Kain 
has to restore peace and save Akranis and the dragon race. 
 
The game is a rather unusual example of a side-scrolling action game, in which the player controls a 
dragon. Sarken is able to fly in any direction, but so are the enemies in the game, most of which are 
other dragons. The dragon has a HP bar which is depleted when he is damaged by enemy attacks or 
traps. Beside physically attacking, the dragon can also learn and cast offensive and protective 
magical spells.

Might and Magic: Book I (c) 1988 New World Computing, Inc. / Star Craft 
 
In Might and Magic, the player controls a party of adventurers in a medieval world called Varn. 
Before long the heroes realize that one of the four kings that rule the countries of Varn is in fact 
an impostor, a creature from outer space. Your task is to find the real king and ultimately to stop 
the alien invasion into Varn. 
 
This is the first game in the  Might and Magic series, and one of the prototypes of role-playing 
games in general. The entire game is viewed from first-person perspective. The player creates a party 
of six adventurers, with traditional classes to choose from (fighter, cleric, etc.). The player also 
specifies the gender and the age of the characters - they grow old and will eventually die of natural 
causes. As in most RPGs, the gameplay revolves around exploring the game world, performing quests, 
and leveling up to be able to proceed to the story-advancing challenges. The turn-based battles 
typically take place against six monsters, but enemy reinforcements can appear once their comrades 
have been slain.

A balanced party is a necessity in this game. There are several locations and items that are 
restricted to certain genders, alignments, or races. A party made up of Good Human Males won't get 
you very far. Time plays a large role in this game. Time travel is a part of it, but on a more basic 
level, you will find that characters age as the game goes on. If you wait too long, your characters' 
statistics will change to reflect their aging.

able to buy weapons and armor (both for you and your companions), medicine and...clues. You will also 
find caves, dungeons, and monuments that are scattered. Some you may enter unhindered. Others will be 
locked...until you find the right person or learn the right spell. 
 
Also within each land, you will encounter monsters such as evil merchants, Weasly wimps, Unmutaks, 
Great Lions, Gelfises, Zirods, and many more. Some of these monsters do less damage than others, and  
take more damage themselves. You can either attack them yourself using your weapons or spells, or 
make your companions attack the monsters themselves. When defeated, most monsters will either leave 
behind some coins, which you can spend to buy stuff at the towns, or some items, which you can also 
use to defeat monsters. 
 
However, not all inhabitants are monsters. You will also meet merchants and travelers who might tell

Mirage (c) 1992 Discovery / Discovery 
 
It happened long time ago, when mankind possessed the secrets of magic. One time, when a comet was 
approaching the Earth, a young woman gave birth to a baby. He was taken into the nearby village and 
grew up there. But he knew he was different from other children: he could not use magic, and on his 
hand there was a little star. He believed that he was cursed, and so did many people in his village. 
He learns that the ominous cave in the Northern Mountain might hold the answers to his questions. He 
embarks on this journey, determined to find out the identity of his father and his true role in the 
world. 
 
Mirage is essentially a dungeon crawler: the biggest portion of the game is spent navigating 
pseudo-3D maze-like dungeons (auto-mapped), fighting random enemies in turn-based combat. The hero is 
accompanied by another character, and both participate in combat. With time the hero and his 
companion learn magical spells. Dungeons also contain areas where weapons and items can be purchased. 
 
There are also extensive portions of Japanese-style adventure in the game, during which the player 
uses verb-based menu interface ("Look", "Move", etc.). 
 
The game contains scenes with nudity and erotic images (though nothing "hardcore"). Many of the 
random enemies are pretty female demons, who disrobe when defeated.

Molecule Man is trapped inside a radioactive maze of 256 screens, and it's your job to get him out. 
To do this you must collect 16 circuits which are located at extreme points of the levels. You must 
regularly consume radiation tablets to fend off certain poisoning, and your initial supply of 20 is 
totally inadequate. 
 
Fortunately, there are coins dotted around the levels, as well as ant-radiation tablet vending 
machines at which you can buy them. Coins can also be used to buy more time, or to blow up obstacles 
which make some sections difficult or impossible to access. 
 
Viewed isometrically, the screen designs are intentionally surreal, each taking on an unlikely 
distorted real-world theme. If you find the initial level layouts too easy, too hard or too dull, you 
can design a new set with the bundled maze editor.

problem solving or playing with numbers. 
 
Some monkeys are minding their own business when they see a number missing from their arithmetic 
problem. Who took it? Another monkey, a crab? And where could it be? The only way to find that out is 
to go looking for it. 
 
Guide your monkey across the screen and up and down platform levels. Watch out for the crab! If its 
claws bite you, you lose a monkey. Jump up and pull down shades to find the missing number. When you 
find it, catch the number bar. Then send it up to your helper monkey. Find three missing numbers and 
earn bonus points!

Monster Hunter (c) Dec 23, 2006 Nerlaska Studio / Nerlaska Studio 
 
Made in the old Japanese top-down style, Monster Hunter is a straight-forward RPG with a few original 
twists. You, as a knight, find yourself in a foreign land, and must find the king to be granted 
passage out of the kingdom. Thus, you find yourself on a typical console RPG quest to find one 
person, help him find an item, let him tell you where to find another person who can tell you where 
to find item X, and so on. 
 
Outside of the major population centres are random encounters with monsters, which makes the game 
change to a battle screen. You can equip your character with new weapons and armours, and you have a 
range of magic spells available to you as well. Fighting is carried out in a peculiar manner, similar 
to certain golf games. You have a quickly rotating power bar, and pressing the button when it is at 
its highest makes your attack stronger.

Moonsweeper (c) 1985 Imagic / Toshiba-EMI Ltd. 
 
In Moonsweeper your goal is to rescue miners from the moons in Star Quadrant Jupiter. You begin your 
mission in space where you must avoid deadly aurora flares, photon torches and space bullets from the 
sun in this quadrant. From time to time you will see a moon pass by, and by flying near it you can 
descend to the surface. As you sweep along the surface, you will see stranded miners which need to be 
rescued by flying over them. Also on the moons surface are various obstacles which must be avoided or 
destroyed, such as towers and lunar satellites as well as alien surface destroyers. Should you 
survive and rescue six miners (the maximum your ship can carry), then you may take off from the 
surface by using the accelerator rings. There are several different types of moons found in this 
quadrant, each with a different level of difficulty. To help out, your ship is equipped with photon 
torpedoes and shields (though you will lose points while using the shield).

$<a href="http://www.mobygames.com/game/msx/mule"</a>
$bio
 
 
M.U.L.E. (c) 1988 Ozark Softscape / Bullet-Proof Software, Inc. 
 
M.U.L.E. is about four hopeful explorers trying to make a fortune on a virgin planet. This is done 
  by producing various goods (Food, Energy, Smithore, Crystite). Each of these goods have their uses: 
  if you don't have enough food, you will have less time during your turn. If you don't have enough 
  energy, your output will be lower. If enough smithore isn't produced, there will be a shortage of 
  M.U.L.E.s. Crystite is the big earner that can make or break your game. 
 
You start the game by selecting your race. Some are easier to play, some harder. There are three 
levels of difficulty, in the easiest the game only lasts 6 turns, but the real game is 12 turns. 
Crystite is not available at the easiest level. 
 
Each turn starts with land claim. Each player gets to choose a spot of land for themselves from the 
map. If two players choose the same spot, the player with less money wins. The map consists of 
different landscape. River is best for producing food, plains for energy, mountains for smithore. 
Crystite is hidden and must be first found by taking a land sample to the town. 
 
After the land claim each player takes turns in cultivating their land and do other tasks. They can 
buy M.U.L.E.s to start production on their land, sabotage other players by buying M.U.L.E.s and 
letting them loose, try to catch the Wumpus for cash and try to find crystite veins. The time to do 
these things depends on if the player has enough food. Finally the player goes to the casino and wins 
a small amount of money, depending on how much time was left. 
 
After the cultivation phase is the production phase where each land produces an amount of goods 
depending on a number of factors such as if the player has enough energy in storage, what type of 
land is used, and some random events such as sunspots that increase energy output. Also, if the same 
player has plots producing the same goods next to each other, they gain a bonus. Three plots of same 
production type anywhere on the map by the same player also gives a bonus. 
 
Third phase is the most interesting one: the auction. Here the players buy and sell their goods on 
open market. Players negotiate the price by moving up and down on the screen. The shop also has 
prices that depend on how abundant or scarce the goods is. So if there is a shortage of food, the 
price goes up and vice versa. This allows for interesting tactics, especially if one player manages 
to monopolize food, energy or smithore production. If there is no food, others don't have time to 
change their production types, if there is a shortage of energy, their land won't produce and if 
there are no M.U.L.E.s they can't change production type on their plot. Hoarding goods also has a 
drawback in the form of surplus where each turn a percentage of goods is wasted. 
 
There are a number of random events in the game. Some affect one player, usually the one winning gets 
small penalties and the losing player(s) get small rewards. The big events that happen randomly are: 
- M.U.L.E. goes crazy - the M.U.L.E. on one of the plots runs away losing production for that round 
  plus the money to replace it. 
- Planetquake - production of smithore and crystite is much lower. 
- Fire in store - all stock in the shops are destroyed (which means prices will skyrocket, but if 
  you needed to buy something, you are at the mercy of other players). 
- Pirate attack - pirates steal all crystite from stores and players (in the easiest level they 
  steal smithore). Nasty if you happened to have a lot of them waiting for better prices. 
- Acid rain storm - affects the plot under the storm and below it by boosting food production and 
  decreasing energy production. 
- Sunspot activity - increases energy production. 
- Pest attack - eats all food on one plot. 
- Meteor strike - destroys the M.U.L.E on the plot it strikes but creates a very rich crystite 
  plot. 
 
M.U.L.E always has four players, with 1-4 human players possible and the rest played by the AI. 
  Because the players only need two buttons at most (up/down in auction) in auction, it's easy to 
  play with four people around the computer. 
 
M.U.L.E is a very finely tuned game where rewards, penalties, time to use for various tasks etc. 
  have been perfectly fine tuned to keep the game balanced. Rules and the random events mean that no 
  two games are the same.

passengers and crew members.But your first  job is to find the body. Until you do, any information 
you gather will be of little value. Once you find the body, the other  passengers will prove to be 
much more talkative.

solved, make an  accusation by going to the character that you want to accuse and by using the

Mutan Zone (c) 1988 Opera Soft S.A. / Opera Soft S.A. 
 
Scorpio was one of the most beautiful space colonies of all the galaxy and its raw materials were one 
of the fundamental points of the terrestrial wealth. But, one day, the explosion of a Supernova 
altered the genes of the inhabitants of the planet, turning them into strange beings who hate the 
human specie and want to destroy it. In such a situation, the Earth space services sent a series of 
scientists in order to study the mutation and the way for solving it. But they were captured and 
forced to work for the scorpians in the creation of a definitive weapon that would make disappear our 
planet of the Solar System. Only a Rainbow-Command could avoid it and your help will be indispensable 
for the attainment of the mission. 
 
The game is composed of two parts, within which there are two introduction sub-games that will allow 
you to obtain some additional lives before starting the game itself. On the first part you will have 
to face a series of natural obstacles while shooting to everything with strange looks, for that, you 
count with a laser and a cosmic hammer, but you also should take batteries for your portable radar 
that informs to you of the enemy situation. 
 
Once finished this part, you will start the last one, in which you must be careful in not crashing 
your newly-acquired motorcycle with the multiple obstacles you will find, at the same time you get 
rid of the mutants, whereas you go to the laboratory where you will have to liberate the kidnapped 
scientists.  It won't be easy - you will find the head of the mutants who is anxious to give you a 
warm welcome.

Mystery of the Nile (c) 1986 Made in Spain / Zigurat 
 
In this unofficial adaptation of the film "The Jewel of the Nile", three travelers have been captured 
by a dictatorial regime in an Arab country. They must escape the country at once, and the player is 
the only one who can help them. 
 
In the initial screens all three tourists need to be reunited from their different prison cells. Each 
character also needs to find their weapon of choice, those being grenades, a pistol and an umbrella. 
Control between any of the travelers can be switched at any moment by typing 1, 2 or 3. 
 
Once the three travelers are reunited, every screen acts as a puzzle of sorts: the player is given a 
few seconds to strategically place each character before enemies appear. When they do, two of the 
characters will react automatically to the enemies, and the player will directly control the last 
character. If all enemies in the screen are eliminated and the three characters survive, they will 
advance to the next screen.

Night City (c) Dec 21, 2006 Yermani Soft / Yermani Soft 
 
You have been out partying, but when you arrive at your house, you notice that you've lost your keys. 
Furthermore, you've promised to be home at 3:00, and your watch is missing too. Suddenly, you are 
approached by a police officer who asks for your ID, and you can't seem to find that either. You run 
from the police, into the night city. You must find your identification, your watch and your keys 
before 3 o'clock! 
 
In this arcade adventure game, you run through the streets of the bleak city infested with rats, 
angry policemen and evil ghosts, looking for your belongings. The streets scroll from left to right, 
and going up or down takes you to another street. You've got a gun with which to kill the enemies, 
but they respawn quickly, and when you've run out of bullets, you can only rely on kicks, or try to 
avoid the ghosts' rays by ducking. At some spots, you can replenish your energy and ammunition. 
 
Finding your watch will let you know how much time you have left, the ID papers will stop the police 
from bothering you, and finding all your keys will allow you to get home and end the game. The action 
is fast, and so is the in-game music accompanying the suitably toned-downed graphics of Night City.

Nightmare Collection: Dead of the Brain - Shiry no Sakebi (c) Jul 17, 1992 FairyTale / FairyTale 
 
The day began with great news: the genius scientist Dr. Cooger phoned his friend, a young man named 
Cole, and told him that he has, in fact, invented a medicine that resurrects living beings! So, 
where's the catch? Well, there seems to be a tiny problem... the resurrected creature turns into a 
wild, murderous zombie! After such a "resurrection" (performed on a poor policeman), the great 
scientist and his buddy escape to the cemetery, where they accidentally drop the vial with the 
resurrection medicine... 
 
Dead of the Brain is a horror adventure game. Most of the time in the game is spent controlling Cole, 
exploring zombie-infested buildings and trying to survive. The interaction with the environment is 
performed by selecting verb commands, always available as an interface ( Look, Talk, Move, Get, Use, 
and Go!), and then clicking on the appropriate object/person on the screen. Though absence of real 
puzzles makes the game a Japanese-style adventure, the interactivity is higher than normally in games 
of this genre. The game also features timed tasks, when the player has to figure out quickly what to 
do before the heroes are killed by a zombie.

Between the Seas of the Seven Islands and the purple Mountains lies a valley. Time was that this area 
was safe and hospitable, however darkness then came - killing many of the inhabitants and warping the 
minds of the others. Many have gone there, none have returned - can you be the first? 
 
Nightshade is an arcade adventure in scrolling isometric 3D (an advance on earlier Ultimate titles 
such as Knight Lore, which were flick-screen), with directional or rotational controls. You can take 
3 hits from the various roaming monsters - turning from white to yellow to green as you take them - 
but a 4th costs you one of your five lives. Objects can be thrown at these foes, but only if you have 
any. 
 
The map is made up of medieval-style buildings, which are visible while you are on the outside but 
whose roofs lift when you enter them, to ensure full visibility. There are four super-villains to 
destroy (a mad monk, a skeleton, a ghost, and Mr Grimreaper), and you must find the right objects to 
do this.

Ninja Jajamaru-kun (c) 1986 Jaleco Ltd. / Jaleco Ltd. 
 
In a realm of feudal Japanese folklore the eponymous Ninja Jajamaru-kun must rescue his beloved 
Princess Sakura from the clutches of a fiendish catfish-faced pirate. 
 
Jajamaru-kun begins on the bottom of a three tiered horizontal field. On each level of this field 
there are two enemies on each tier. The tiers have weak brick ceilings that Jajamaru-kun can break by 
jumping into them. Once a passage is made Jajamaru-kun can move through them as can enemies. To clear 
a level all enemies must be defeated, most enemies can be killed by having a shuriken thrown at them, 
the only weapon available without a power-up, some need to be stunned either by falling through a 
hole in a tier or by being jumped on. Enemy projectiles can also be canceled out by the shuriken. 
Being touched by an enemy projectile, or in a few cases an enemies body, will instantly kill 
Jajamaru-kun. After an enemy has been killed its spirit will ascend, you can grab this for extra 
points. 
 
In each stage at the 80 seconds remaining mark Princess Sakura will, fittingly, drop a cherry blossom 
onto the field. This will float through the platforms and eventually slip off the bottom of the 
screen, unless the ninja intercepts this message from his love. Once three blossoms have been 
collected a bonus stage will occur. In the bonus stage the foe is the Pirate Lord on the top throwing 
fire down onto Jajamaru-kun below. Here shuriken can be thrown upwards. One hit kills the pirate and 
frees the princess. As the game progresses these bonus stages become more difficult adding clones of 
the wicked lord and more fire. 
 
As the levels progress the new enemies, based on Japanese folklore, emerge. A new enemy will always 
appear as a "boss". This new enemy will be the only one of its kind on the top tier and all the other 
spirits will be comprised of the previous boss. The boss will be more intelligent than the other 
minions. After a spirit has been the boss for several stages it will become the standard minion and 
loss some of its difficulty. A new more difficult boss will then appear for the next few levels, and 
so on. 
 
Items can be found occasionally by breaking a brick ceiling, the items in any give stage are 
randomized.  Items once uncovered will remain until another ceiling is broken or are picked up. Items 
that alter the status of ninja have a transient effect. 
 
The items in this game are: 
 
1. Speed-up: This red ball will increase the determined ninja's speed, now he can get behind even 
   the most cunning kami. 
 
2. Ninja-cart: This little carriage can crush anything in it's path and move at incredible speeds, 
   find this and your victory will be assured! 
 
3. Shuriken: Finding this shuriken will increase the distance your deadly ninja stars can be 
   thrown, snipe those oni. 
 
4. Invisibility Potion: A highly potent blend capable of turning this ninja, if not totally 
   invisible, into an invincible outline. 
 
5. Inscribed Coins: These coins give additional points, different colors give different point 
   valuations. 
2. Extra Ninja: These little ninjas are extra lives, very rare! 
 
6. Bombs: These two bombs can appear when a ceiling is cracked open. If the player is careless 
   enough to jump into them after they are revealed he will surely meet his death. Enemies may pass 
   through bombs with impunity. 
 
7. Trusty Frog: The trusty frog is Jajamaru-kun's trusty steed, by getting three different items, 
   or by gaining four lives, the frog will appear.

hardship to the people, and the princess who opposed him was confined to a dungeon somewhere in the

techniques, in addition to the one that transforms them into a wolf, they protect him from the people 
who are his enemies. 
 
You play Kazamuru, a great warrior who challenges the clan to a fight in order to rescue the 
princess. However, he can't rescue the princess unless he finds the five scrolls in the thirteen 
areas of Ohkami. On his quest, he must defeat various ninjas such as Kuno-ichi and Ninniku, as well 
as fire-blowing ninjas, slashing ninjas, and footloose ninjas. You'll explore grassy fields, shrines, 
river banks,  towns, and the castle itself. Some of the steps have varied gameplay. For example, you

Nobunaga's Ambition (c) 1987 KOEI Co., Ltd. / KOEI Co., Ltd. 
 
In the 16th century, Japan's Sengoku ("Warring States") period divided the nation into numerous 
feudal states, each ruled by a daimyo. These daimyos would often go to war with each other. Many 
dreamt of conquering the land, becoming the Shogun and ruling the entire country. One of those 
daimyos was the ambitious Nobunaga Oda, a merciless ruler and a renowned strategist. Players take on 
the role of Nobunaga Oda or one of many other daimyos to try to conquer Japan. 
 
Nobunaga's Ambition is a turn-based strategy game which can be played in different modes. Gameplay is 
similar to Koei's better known Romance of the Three Kingdoms game. Players begin by selecting either 
a 17 regions scenario or a larger 50 scenario. Then, the player must select a daimyo, each of which 
is rated attributes in several categories

Nobunaga's Ambition II (c) 1989 KOEI Co., Ltd. / KOEI Co., Ltd. 
 
Nobunaga's Ambition II is the sequel to Nobunaga's Ambition. The setting is 16th century feudal 
Japan, a period when ruthless daimyo (feudal lords) contended with each other for dominance. 
Ultimately, the winner in this struggle will become Shogun and hold actual power over the islands, 
while being nominally subject to the Emperor. 
 
The game casts the player as one of the daimyo, allowing them freedom to decide the fate and future 
of feudal Japan, through diplomacy and ultimately war. The objective is to unify Japan under the 
player's rule. If the player fails through death on the battlefield, assassination at the hands of a 
ninja, or through natural causes, they can choose a successor and play on. Functionally, the first 
job is to let prosper the fief (province) under the player's control through agricultural development 
and town investment. 
 
There are two scenarios available in the game: 
 
1. Warlords: 1560 A.D. 
The first scenario begins as the daimyo prepare what will eventually become a full scale war in the 
whole of Japan. The warring states period begins here. There are 28 of them included in the scenario, 
among others: the Mori clan, the Takeda, the Hojo clan, the Uesugi clan, etc. 
 
Nobunaga's Ambition: 1582 A.D. 
The second scenario follows the rise of Oda Nobunaga in 1582 A.D. to power and allows the player to 
play either as Oda Nobunaga or as one of his chief allies or rivals. 
 
Samurai 
The game improves on its predecessor by including some 400 historical samurai in the game, providing 
the player with generals for troops and governors for a conquered fief. 
 
Each samurai is characterized by statistics: Age, Rank, Body Points, War, Politics, Ambition, 
Charisma, and Loyalty. There are also additional attributes for specific military purposes: Skill, 
Arms Level, and Unit Type. Some of these attributes may be improved through training (i.e. war, 
politics, and skill), rewards (i.e. loyalty), or through merchants (i.e. arms level). 
 
Strategy 
The game is turn-based, with each turn representing one month. Certain events take place annually 
such as tax collecting (March) and rice harvest (September), while other events, such as invading 
neighbors, follows the player's time table. 
 
The game uses an initiative system to determine what actions can be completed in a particular month. 
Each daimyo and samurai has a stock of "Body Points" that represent the attention he can afford to 
spend on an action. Each action has a cost in Body Points for the character executing it, and if he 
does not have the point’s necessary, he may not perform it. Body Points are refreshed a little each 
month. The level of Body Points refreshed per month is depends on the level of his Political skill. 
Intensive operations will deplete Body Points and then require turns of inaction to stock up again, 
so timing actions to coincide with Body Point availability is an extra wrinkle to the management of 
resources. 
 
Combat 
Each samurai can lead a 100-strong unit, which must be recruited, then trained, and equipped with 
weapons for battle. The attack of an army results in a tactical play out of the resulting battle or 
siege. A hex-based map of the area of the battlefield will form the playing board for the movement to 
combat and actual fighting. Fortifications (castles) have a dramatic benefit for the defender. The 
attacker must defeat the defender within 30 days or must force a withdrawal. Additionally, both sides 
must pay attention to their food provisions as each day subtracts food supplies in accordance to 
their army size. 
 
Unit Types 
The game introduces 3 basic military unit types: Infantry (Inf), Cavalry (Cav), and Rifles (Rif). 
Each unit type has certain special abilities and tactical advantages/disadvantages in combat: 
 
1. Infantry have the ability to ambush anywhere on the main fief map (explained later) and have 4 
   movement points

prove that you're brave enough! 
 
My boy, you'll be locked in the Castle with no name. You've to survive the nightmare world inside... 
and escape alive! Others have tried without success, and were sadly transformed into ogres by the 
evil mage Nirlem. Good luck! 
 
This was one of the first games by Dinamic. It's a challenging side-scrolling game with Ghosts N' 
Goblins style gameplay, with some strange monsters (you know, the Castle was previously owned by 
Alucard!) and potions that can help you a bit. By the way... you can climb ropes, and will frequently 
need to.

Nyancle Racing (c) 1988 Bit² / Matsushita Electric Industrial Co., Ltd. 
 
Nyancle Racing is a top-down racing game from Japan. The gameplay is reminiscent of the 1983 classic 
Bump 'N' Jump. The player controls a vehicle shaped like a mechanic animal on a track filled with 
obstacles, collectable rolling pieces of candy (the game currency) and other enemy racers. The main 
objective is to arrive at the end before the timer runs out. The competition tries to delay progress 
by bumping into the vehicle to steer it off the road. The racers can take flight by passing over some 
squares scattered throughout the course. Pit-stops (presented as a house with a red sign painted on 
the roof and a "IN" sign painted on the track) are positioned at regular intervals beside the main 
track. Once inside them, a screen comes up with a choice of two shops where the candy can be spent: 
 
? The one on the left is the Unusual Items Shop, that sells a variety of power-ups: extra lives, 
boosts for speed/jump/steering and extra time. 
 
? The one on the right is the Relief Hospital, where the player can assess the damage and repair the 
vehicle.

Oberon 69 (c) 1990 Diabolic Soft / G.LL. Software S.A. 
 
You find yourself in a world where the air has become unbreathable and Sun's light barely reaches 
planet Earth. With your planet almost desertic, many cities began to be built in other planets of the 
solar system. But... in Oberon, the fourth satellite, there appeared an strange life form, which did 
just awake from its lethargy. The worst of all is that these new creatures have started attacking the 
human populations, even if they are babies! 
 
Without wasting any more second, you decide to go to Oberon to save the few babies still alive, 
before they are eaten by these monsters. Once there, your mission would be to find the babies and 
send them to planet Earth in a safe way. For this, you will have to buy a cryogenic valve for each 
one of them in the ATMs of the Company, in order to provide them more safe travel. When you finish 
the mission, you will have to buy a ticket back to Earth. 
 
Oberon 69 is an arcade platformer where you will have to use your pistol to kill larvae, tentacles, 
robots, alien queens and her eggs, with the advantage that you can make frontal or vertical shots.

the objective being to score as much points as possible by passing the animal with the best arts. 
Players will also have the possibility to take off the "capote" (cloth) in order to run faster and 
distract the beast in one of those moments of maximum danger. But in case the bull does attack, no 
problem, the player just has to wake up and take the capote again.

Operation Wolf (c) 1988 Taito Corporation / Ocean Software Ltd. 
 
You have been recruited for Operation Wolf, a desperate attempt to rescue prisoners from the enemy. 
Through a series of missions, you'll engage a variety of enemies, from soldiers to ninjas, patrol 
boats to helicopters, and more. Can you carry the day? 
 
Operation Wolf is an arcade conversion of the game by Taito. It is essentially a bitmapped 
"rail-shooter", where you basically hold the gun and shoot just about everything that moves, while 
conserving your ammo and grenades. Shoot ammo/grenades and healing items on the screen to "pick them 
up". Your primary machine gun can kill everything if you hit it enough times, but you can also use 
the grenade launcher for really deadly targets like helicopters or armored cars. You can collect a 
machine gun which will allow you to shoot faster for a few seconds. 
 
You'll be pummelled by a LOT of enemies. Some will be shooting, others will be tossing grenades, 
knifes, and more. Some are armored and requires more than a few hits, others dodges. You can shoot 
grenades and knifes out of the air if you aim well enough. There are also civilians running around 
which can be shot, but it's not beneficial. 
 
Bosses appear at the end of some levels, and each has a specific weakness you need to exploit.

   Pac-Man, Chomp Chomp, and Sourpuss. 
 
There are sixteen rounds to complete, with four trips each. During each round, he can grab a power 
pellet, which cause ghosts to turn blue, allowing Pac-Man to eat them for points. Points are also 
awarded by collecting fruit that appear, like cherries and strawberries. In some rounds, Pac must use 
a springboard to jump over a lake. He must also make it to the end of each round before time runs 
out, otherwise a ghost will chase him.

Pac-Man's goal is continually challenged by four ghosts: The shy blue ghost Bashful (Inky), the

   ghost Pokey (Clyde).  One touch from any of these ghosts means a loss of life for Pac-Man. 
 
Pac-Man can turn the tables on his pursuers by eating of the four Energizers located within the 
   maze.  During this time, the ghosts turn blue, and Pac-Man can eat them for bonus points.  This

   regenerate to chase after Pac-Man again.

Panzer Attack is a computerised wargame similar to the board-game Risk, representing World War II's 
crucial Battle of the Bulge. The player represents General Hodges, a commander of the US forces, 
while the computer always plays the German side. The gameplay is turn-based - you move all your tanks 
using map references, then the computer does the same. 
 
You have to try to protect your fuel dumps against the Germans. The difficulty can be determined by 
setting how many German divisions are attacking - the default is 200. Intelligence advice you receive 
is not always accurate, so pay attention to what you can see on the map.

Paris-Dakar (c) 1988 Made in Spain / Zigurat 
 
Paris-Dakar is a rally simulator in which the player controls a wide variety of variables, including 
the state of the car (gasoline, water, damages, gear box...) and the race route (always accessible), 
among others. If needed, the player can refuel, buy water or whatever else is required from the 
powerboats in Europe or the tankers in Africa. Prices of these essential materials aren't always very 
reasonable, given the player's meagre starting wallet, motivating players to earn higher sponsorships 
through strong performance in the race. 
 
There are three different stages: one in Europe, another one in the desert of the Sahara, and finally 
a crossing of the Tenere desert before arriving in Dakar.

The only playing option is the European Championship tournament of the day, although you can choose 
the 8 teams from the 26 major European footballing nations of the time (so the USSR, Czechoslovakia 
and Yugoslavia are all still complete). Two players can compete in these groups, but there's no 
guarantee of getting straight to a 2-player game, especially as tournaments (and individual matches) 
can't be quit out of. 
 
The gameplay features variable strength kicks, determined by how long you hold the fire button for. 
In a break with realistic physics, the ball ricochets back in the direction it came from. Goalkeepers 
stay on the goal-line rather than using the whole penalty box.

they both had to go to different colleges. They promised each other than they will still be together. 
But they both broke the promise... 
 
If jealousy and the knowledge of one's own betrayal were not enough to endanger their relationship, 
something far worse happened... the man with whom Mayumi spent the night was found murdered, and 
Hiroshi must forget his personal pain in order to solve the mystery... 
 
Pias is a traditional Japanese-style adventure. The gameplay consists of choosing verb commands

all the commands at every screen.

first, and as the serve reverses every five points, you are guaranteed to have more chances to serve 
than your opponent (remember the significance of 10 and 15 in the scoring). The points system rewards 
long rallies and large winning margins, as you get points for each hit, for each point won, and for

Poli Diaz is a boxing game protagonized by the Spanish boxing star of the late eighties, Policarpio 
Díaz. This game uses an isometric perspective where two boxers revolve around the center of the ring, 
with no possibility of going back, and we observe it from a corner of the quadrilateral. The options 
menu is the usual: one or two player mode, choose the control type and the number of assaults and 
lenght of the same. 
 
Our first opponent will be a sparring, that without offering much opposition, will allow us to learn 
about the control of the game. After this weak opponent is defeated, you will have to fight (in 
order) for the titles of Spain, Europe and the World against other opponents. 
 
"Poli Diaz" has two different modes of control, one of attack and other of defence. In the former, 
and with the appropriate combination of hits and movement, we will attack the contrary, and in the 
second we will cover of the  punches that undoubtedly fall over us. In this context, using a joystick 
could be recommendable.

In this remake of the arcade game Pooyan from the early '80s, you play the role of a pig, protecting 
its piglets from wolves. 
 
The first screen takes place near the pigs' home.  Mrs. Pig rides up and down in a cable car, 
shooting at wolves, who are riding balloons downward, towards the ground.  If the wolves land safely 
on the ground, then they can climb a ladder, near the cable-car, and catch Mrs. Pig.  But if she 
shoots their balloons, they splat on the ground instead. 
 
The wolves shoot acorns at the pig.  But Mrs. Pig has a food based weapon too.  If she gets to the 
top, she can get meat, to toss at the wolves and make them jump off their balloons in pursuit.  Each 
wolf taken out this way is worth bonus points (on a doubling scheme: 400, 800 1600...) 
 
The second scene takes place at the wolves lair.  Here the wolves have reinforced balloons--it takes 
multiple hits to make them fall.  Here they float upwards toward a big rock, which they push on top 
of Mrs. Pig, when seven wolves are present.  Additionally, an alpha wolf (wolf leader) appears and 
summons wolves in packs.

Power Drift (c) 1989 SEGA Enterprises Ltd. / Activision (UK) Limited 
 
Ever wanted to race dune buggies at high speed on a variety of tracks? Power Drift is an arcade racer 
that gives you the chance to do just that. 
 
There are 5 tracks to choose from, each with 5 stages. The stages range from cities, to deserts to 
tracks over water. There are also 12 drivers to pick from, from businessmen to skinheads and 
mohicans. 
 
Your buggy has 2 gears, high and low. Once the light goes green, just keep the pedal to the metal. 
You’ll need to place third or higher to continue to the next stage. Be careful not to bump into other 
buggies or objects next to the road. While you’re buggy can take a pounding, crashing will slow you 
down. 
 
Finish all 5 stages in a level and you’ll be presented with a bonus level.

Power Strike (c) 1988 Compile / Compile 
 
The Earth is threatened by mutant plant life and their brainwashed human followers. Only one force 
can stop the evil vegetables from taking root: Power Strike, the most versatile jet fighter in the 
world.  Blast the enemy in the air and and on the ground and save the planet from the creeping green 
menace. 
 
There are six rounds to complete (three in the mobile version). In each round, numbers (from 1 to 8) 
can be found on the ground either enclosed by a ring, or in the air carried by a ship. Getting these 
numbers will upgrade your firepower. Get more of the same number for a maximum upgrade. 
Unfortunately, whatever the type of firepower you get, you will have a limited supply of ammo, so you 
need to stock up on the same type of firepower if you get too low. 
 
At the end of each round, there is an end-of-round boss which involves shooting parts of its base in 
order to destroy it. Intermediate bosses can be found in the last three rounds (console version 
only).

guerillas and wildlife using  variety of weapons including machine guns, laser rays, and grenades 
(all with unlimited ammo). You exit the stage by entering a cave to proceed to the next level.

one, depending on what cave you enter. 
 
After three or so stages, you enter the game's Big Mode. The object here is to blast blue and purple 
spheres before they have a chance to hurt you. Some spheres have power-ups that will increase your 
firepower. When you have made some distance, you have to defeat the Predator before you can continue

Predator's attack pattern.

You are a noble warrior who has just saved your kingdom from an invasion by the terrible Demon Lord. 
The grateful king offers you to choose any reward you wish for your brave deed. But instead of opting 
for half of the kingdom or the riches of the land, you ask the king for the permission to raise a 
poor little orphan girl named Maria. 
 
And so the game begins. You are the one who has to build Maria's future. Of course, you can do it in 
many ways. You can strive to make a real princess out of her, teach her good manners, study arts, to 
make her a brave fighter like yourself, or just a lazy bimbo who cares for nothing. Her destiny is in 
your hands!

Puzznic (c) 1990 Taito Corporation / Zemina Co. 
 
The challenge in each level of Puzznic is to maneuvre a selection of blocks into place so as to clear 
them all, by making them make contact with blocks of the same design. You control a cross-hair, which 
can move a block left or right, which can cause it to fall if there is no block under the space it 
would occupy. 
 
There are many complications in terms of solving the levels. Moving platforms meaning that you need 
to move a block at a particular time, or in particular order, to prevent them being blockaded. In 
some situations there are an odd number of a certain type of block - solving these requires 
positioning two of the blocks one space apart, such that a move will result in a piece making contact 
with 2 others, and immediately removing all 3. You will also encounter blocks positioned on platforms 
suspended in space and gaps in level arrangements meaning that a certain number of blocks must be in 
place to make a certain move possible (by forming a stack, for example) 
 
The game structure is slightly unusual, as after you complete each batch of four levels you get a 
choice of 2 sets of levels - you are progressing through an expanding matrix of levels, which means 
there are 2 sets on level 2, 3 on level 3, 4 on level 4, and so on. This means that there are a total 
of 220 screens in the game. Each screen is played against a time limit, and losing a level (either by 
running out of time, or by making a poor move and leaving an impossible position) loses one of your 3 
lives.

to figure out how to get across to a certain area without putting yourself in fatal danger. You fight 
riflemen, archers, snakes, and other baddies. A few different endings are offered in this game 
depending on how you choose to rescue the girl, the best ending - being able to escape with the girl 
safely.

Rambo III (c) 1988 Ocean Software Ltd. / Ocean Software Ltd. 
 
Rambo's mission is set deep in Afghanistan, in the days when the Soviets occupied it, and America was 
putting this right (we won't mention who they enlisted to do so). Colonel Trautman has been kidnapped 
by the Soviets, and you've gone in there to rescuing him. Doing so is a three-part operation 
approximately following the plot of the film. 
 
In the first part, you explore the building Trautman could be in, through a top-down view of the 
building. It is heavily protected by infra-red security beams, which when activated unleadsh the 
enemies. The locations of the beams are only apparent if you collect the special goggles. Other 
hazards include mines, trapdoors and booby-trapped doors, but there are enhanced weapons to collect. 
 
Section two is identical to the first, except that it is located outside, the enemy are onto you from 
the start, and there are no traps. The final section changes to an Operation Wolf-style shoot 'em up, 
with a horde of tanks, foot soldiers and helicopters to face. Your gun can jam, which adds to the 
challenge of finally getting out alive.

RNFF: Running Naked in a Field of Flowers (c) Dec 31, 2006 Infinite / Infinite 
 
J-war, Eisbaer23 and Tapeworm, three MSX sceners, have borrowed Snout's holiday house. Each day, 
  they run naked through the fields of flowers surrounding the house, which makes them feel erect. 
  One day, J-war forgets to take his pills. Instead, he takes some of the mushrooms growing in the 
  environs, and loses his senses. 
 
In this platform-puzzle game, which plays like a deranged Jet Set Willy, you guide the naked J-war 
around the one-screen platform levels, trying to pick up all the pills and mushrooms. You are chased 
by a set of clothes, contact with which must be avoided. When you eat pills, you move quickly but 
jump poorly. Eating mushrooms makes you slow, but jump far. Taking this into consideration is the key 
to successfully completing the level. Some places can only be reached by eating mushrooms, and when 
you eat the pills in that place, you are quick enough to run away from the shirt and trousers. 
 
This libelous game was coded for the 2006 edition of the MSXdev coding contest.

Robo Wres 2001 (c) 1987 SEGA Enterprises Ltd. / Micronet Co. Ltd. 
 
As the name implies, Robo Wres 2001 is a game about robots that wrestle in (what then was) the 
future. Six robots from six countries fight in a tournament that, apart from the robot element, is 
closer to American, Mexican or Japanese wrestling than the classic kind of wrestling. Each player 
uses three keys or buttons to execute various attacks in the classic "button masher" beat'em'up 
manner, with different button combinations triggering different techniques according to the proximity 
between the combatants. Each robot has its own arsenal of special moves. The ring is viewed from an 
elevated position and allows movement in two dimensions. The losing robot is turned into scrap ready 
for recycling, with the winner going on the next round.

improve a lot of features that one may consider 'disturbing' from RTK I (e.g. Generals dying easily 
due to disease, etc.). RTK can be said to be much more 'stable' where players no longer have to worry 
that much about time length in the game, as the game take a slower time rate to allow the players to 
build up their forces without much interference. The RTK II gameplay and interface is closely similar 
to Nobunaga's Ambition II.

complete your quest. 
 
The game is a departure from Dragon Slayer RPG-oriented gameplay style. It tends more towards 
medieval-themed platformer action. The hero has hit points, can buy items and weapons, use magic, and 
stay in inns to recover health. However, instead of receiving experience points and becoming 
stronger, you simply must attack quicker (by bumping into your opponent on platform levels) and jump 
higher.

R-Type (c) 1988 Irem Corp. / Irem Corp. 
 
R-Type is a side scrolling shoot 'em up best known for its extremely tough and strategic gameplay.  
  You control the R-9 spaceship as it launches a last-ditch effort to repel the evil Bydo empire. 
 
The R-9 comes equipped as standard with a small gun which can only take down the smallest of enemies 
without firing several shots. By holding down the fire button, it can be loaded up so as to release a 
large burst of energy, eliminating all but the strongest enemies in its path. From time to time, pods 
will come flying in your direction. Upon being shot, they release an upgrade. The first one will 
invariably be the one called "The Force", which is a weapons pod that clings either to the front or 
the back of your ship, absorbing any enemy bullets or acting as a bumper with which you can fly 
head-on into them. You can also use it as an offensive weapon by firing it and pulling it back in. 
Mastering the Force is vital to surviving in R-Type, since it must be used both as protection against 
bullet clusters, as a remote controlled cannon, and in order to clear the screen from obstacles. 
Other upgrades give you target-seeking missiles or a bigger main gun. Different gun types, 
differentiated by their colour, serve different purposes. The blue one sends laser beams bouncing 
across the screen (good for tunnels), the red one fires straight ahead, and the yellow one follows 
any walls it may encounter (good for artillery emplacements). 
 
The stages of R-Type are made in an organic style, certainly inspired by H. R. Giger's artwork for 
the Alien movies. When it came out, it was considered trend-setting since it broke off from the 
stereotypical sci-fi mould of other shoot'em'ups. In part, the levels themselves are your enemy, 
which is exemplified by the fourth, where spider-like creatures weave webs that cover the screen and 
block your path, or levels with intricate tunnel systems. Still, the levels are best handled with a 
combination of strategy and reflexes, without the memorisation that is required of R-Type's 
contemporary rival, Gradius.

personality that enters by the hand of Iber Soft to the world of videogames. 
 
The game develops the eventful journeys that a popular singer -Sabrina- must suffer to be able to be 
transferred from the airport to the nearest television studios. In order to arrive there, she must 
cross a town whose inhabitants seem to be a little dis-conformed with their way to be, to act and, 
mainly, to dress. 
 
Your mission will be to guide Sabrina in this arduous way, avoiding or eliminating as more as 
possible enemies. They are of several kinds, although all of them have an aspect in common: they are 
normal and current people of whom you can be found in the street to dozens. Thus, for example, the 
typical housewives, the knifer, the aggressive punkie, the exorcist priest, the old woman with her 
indispensable cane and a long list of others of citizen tipisms.

Sega's take on the 1943 style of vertically scrolling shoot 'em ups was set in the future. Your 
fighter plane is aged and under-powered, yet you must face down large planes,  tanks and ground 
targets to achieve victory. Each level ends with a close-viewed section of particular intensity 
before finally facing a boss. Smart bombs are occasionally found lying around, and can destroy 
everything on the screen, although you can't use them on the bosses. A simultaneous 2-player mode is 
provided.

The Secret Diary of Adrian Mole Aged 13 (c) 1985 Level 9 Computing, Ltd. / Mosaic Publishing 
 
Sue Townsend created a phenomenon in the mid-1980s, essentially incorporating lots of sharp satire 
and observational humour into the diary of a confused teenager. It might sound like an odd idea for a 
computer game, but Level 9 felt that there was an adventure in there. 
 
Most of the major characters from the book appear, including Adrian's warring parents and their 
respective flings, his sweetheart Pandora, his best mate Nigel, school bully Barry Kent, and 
curmudgeonly pensioner Bert Baxter. The game didn't use many typed commands. You would read passages 
of text (many of them from the book) and be given 3 choices as to what to do, which would lead to 
other events unfolding. Your aim throughout all of this was to make Adrian as popular as possible.

Serra Pelada (c) 1987 
 
João Dente-de-Ouro ("John Goldtooth") was a miner in Serra Pelada ("Naked mountain range"), a 
Brazilian region that had a gold rush from 1980 until 1991. He chanced upon an enormous 154 pounds 
gold nugget that received the nickname "Foreign Debt" by the rejoicing locals. Four days after that 
discovery, João and the gold mysteriously disappeared while the festivities took place. 
 
Serra Pelada is a text adventure from Brazil. The second adventure from Renato Degiovani, it was 
developed with the same set of tools used to create Amazônia. It also shares the first game's limited 
parser (it recognizes pronouns, but can't chain commands), but this time the accentuation of 
Portuguese words is optional. The player has 8 days to find the gold nugget (in-game time passes 
faster than in reality). Once the correct equipment is acquired, gold can be mined and sold, and the 
money received can be used to buy some necessary objects and bribe other characters. As a navigation 
aid, a segmented map of the place can be displayed with the MAPA command. The main danger comes in 
the form of common thieves and the hazardous dilapidated topography of the region (the prospecting 
was performed in open air, there wasn't any mines).

Sewer Sam (c) 1984 Interphase Technologies Inc. / Toshiba-EMI Ltd. 
 
It's a lovely day and Sam is waiting in Central Park to meet his girlfriend Sally. He sees her and 
walks to her. He only has eyes for her and before he realizes it he finds himself in the New York 
sewer system. 
 
Three Russian submarines have been located in the New York sewer system and they have blocked off the 
system. 
Sam's only way out of the sewer system is to destroy the Russian submarines. Luckily, Sam carries his 
revolver. 
Sam can't go back... once he's gone through the City Sewer Department seals the tunnel. Luckily, Sam 
carries his revolver. 
 
The sewer system has three types of sewer tunnels. Tunnels with solid dry floors, tunnels with a 
water passage in the middle and tunnels with pits. 
Sam can walk, run and creep through the tunnels but Sam can't move as quickly in water. 
Sam can move from tunnel to tunnel by entering one of the passages that appear occasionally on his 
way. 
Each time he enters a new sewer, Sam receives a fresh supply of oxygen. 
 
On it's way through the sewer system Sam is under attack by nasties like rats, bats, spiders and 
more. 
The ultimate nasties are the Russian submarines. They are located only in water canals. The status 
bar at the top of the screen contains a distance indicator. It tells you how far Sam has traveled 
into the sewer. If it's red, it means there's a dreaded submarine at the end of the sewer. 
The more nasty elements you shoot, the higher you'll score.

things take a dramatic turn when her housekeeper tells you that Yoshizawa's assistant and niece, 
Rika, hasn't left her room for the entire day. As you break the door, you find Rika dead on the 
floor. The madman has found his first victim... 
 
Shadow Hunter is a graphical adventure game using principles common to Japanese adventures of its 
age, quite similar to Icom's adventures such as Déjà vu, where you have a graphical view occupying 
most of the screen, surrounded by a message box at the bottom and actions on the right. Unlike Icom's 
adventures, though, you cannot choose a verb on the right and then point a cursor on an object on the 
screen. Instead, ready-made actions are presented in an ad-hoc manner according to what is relevant 
to each screen. The game is filled with bad ends – e.g. if you choose to stay at the hotel, the game 
is ended because you're wasting time.

Shanghai is a tile-based game based on the ancient Chinese game of Mah-Jong - this was the first of 
many computer versions. 
 
The gameplay involves 144 tiles, each depicting different images, which have to be removed by 
matching them into pairs. The tiles are arranged in a gridded pattern, which is higher near the 
centre. A tile can only be removed if it has no tile next to it on at least one side. 
 
This computer implementation can generate a random board layout to take on, as well as featuring 5 
preset challenges, some of which have time limits of 5 or 10 minutes, as well as a multiplayer mode.

Due to mysterious circumstances, a flourishing city called Chany's Hill was cut off the rest of the 
world. Investigators found out that most of the buildings were destroyed, horrifying creatures are 
roaming the wilderness, and the few survivors have no means of escaping. The SSWAT (Supernatural 
Special Weapon Attack Team) sends an agent named Laila to the city. The young woman has powerful 
psychic abilities, which can enhance her firearms, helping her deal with the monsters. She must 
rescue the survivors and escort them to safety, at any cost... 
 
Shiryo Sensen - War of the Dead is an action role-playing game. The player navigates Laila over the 
top-down "world map" (the ruined city has basically turned into large wilderness areas with a few 
buildings that are equivalent to "dungeons" in other RPGs), fighting randomly appearing enemies. The 
battles take place on separate side-scrolling screens, and are fully action-based. Laila can jump, 
duck, and attack with melee or ranged weapons. Typically there are several enemies on the screen

Silent Shadow is an arcade with a small aerofighter as protagonist. The objective of the game is to 
get unharmed with maximum discretion a huge bomber to destroy the enemy fleet in the Persian Gulf. To 
do so the player has a modern and sophisticated fighter whose power, speed and ability can get to 
create false images on the radar, making it worthy of the Silent Shadow nickname. 
 
To achieve the goal 4 phases must be overcome (airbase enemy, city, desert and the enemy fleet). The 
idea is not to depart too much from the bomber to avoid being hit by enemy fire, being destroyed and 
ending the game, but neither should you go too  slow because you could clash with the bomber, then 
losing the few opportunities you have. Expansionary pumps are available that can destroy all enemies 
in sight. The game allows collaborative game where up to 2 players can take one aerofighter.

stay of the great castle of Beni-Gómez it's awaiting him, threatening, the death. But there is no 
space for the doubt nor to lie down back. The decision is already taken. The ground runs, it almost 
flies under the firm and implacable push of his feet...

into account that she can be prisoner in different stays, and pay attention to the objects you can 
find on the way

You fly your spaceship through a cave system split in six sections. Pressing the joystick button will

intercept you, and you must not only shoot those down, but also bomb all fuel cisterns you see, or 
you will run out of fuel. 
 
The second cave section introduces aliens that fly up and down in your path. 
 
In the third section, you are met by fire balls which are immune to your bullets. 
 
The fourth section is played out in a very cramped space, where you have little time to react to the 
missile launches. Here, the graphical style changes into a more technological one than the natural 
caves earlier on. 
 
The fifth section is equally cramped, but with steep shafts which must be descended into or ascended 
from with precision, due to the speed at which you are moving. 
 
Finally, the sixth section is an infinite loop where you must bomb a single enemy construction before 
you run out of fuel.

Smack Wacker puts you into the role of a pair of false teeth, stuck in a maze filled with fluour 
pills, and nasty mouth bacteria. So this is a Pac-Man-like maze gobbler. 
 
Unlike the intricate mazes and smart ghosts of Pac-Man, Smack Wacker is very mechanical. The maze is 
made up of smaller and smaller squares inside each other, thereby forming corridors. The openings 
between the corridors move around the edges of the boxes, and the mouth bacteria move singlemindedly 
around and around in their respective corridors. You tell the false teeth to move clockwise or 
counter-clockwise in a corridor, or to stop and wait for the opening to the adjacent corridor to pass 
by. Colliding with the mouth bacteria, which mirror your own movement, doesn't instantly kill you, 
since you have a power bar.

Smash Out (c) 1984 Knights / Mitsubishi Electric 
 
A basic Breakout clone written in BASIC, Smash Out gives you a very small ball and a very small bat 
to break down the brick wall. The small size of the bat is helped slightly by the fact that there are 
some walls even behind the bat, where the ball will bounce if you miss it. In the centre of the back 
wall is still a hole for the ball to pass through, though. As you break down the upper rows of 
bricks, the back wall will first disappear. One the next row of bricks, your bat will move close to 
the wall, giving you less time to catch the ball. Breaking bricks even higher up will shrink your bat 
to the size of only a few pixels. Due to buggy collision detection, the ball will sometimes be 
reflected from invisible parts of your paddle, and it is possible for the ball to bounce through the 
gaps between bricks, destroying bricks much further up before bouncing back straight through the 
bricks further down.

Snatcher (c) Dec 23, 1988 Konami Industry Co. Ltd. / Konami Industry Co. Ltd. 
 
December 2042, Neo Kobe City, a city of madness and decadence... 
 
Mankind is facing its gravest crisis. A mysterious bio-roid life form has appeared. Its true nature 
and purpose are unknown. Is it some country's secret weapon, or an alien from another world? They 
appear in the winter, killing people and taking their place in society. They wear artificial skin and 
can sweat and even bleed. They are called "Snatchers" because they "snatch" their victims before they 
take their place. 
 
A new police force, specifically trained to fight the Snatchers, has been formed. They are JUNKERs 
(Judgement Uninfected Naked Kind and Execute Rangers). Every time you encounter someone, a difficult 
question must be asked — IS IT A PERSON OR A SNATCHER? 
 
You are Gillian Seed, one of the JUNKERs. Your mission is largely adventure-based, with manga-style 
graphics and voice acting. Each room has objects to pick up, examine and use. Conversation with other 
characters is a key plot element. A few short shooting gallery type scenes add an action element. 
While the game is generally scary or comic, a few moments border on the sensual.

Sorcerian (c) Aug, 1991 Nihon Falcom Corp. / Takeru 
 
Sorcerian is the fifth game in the Dragon Slayer series. It is set in the fantasy land known as 
Pentawa, whose inhabitants are in constant need of protection from ferocious creatures roaming the 
wilderness. The king of Pentawa hires a party of adventurers, and their first assignment is to 
retrieve a precious sceptre from a dungeon, where it is guarded by the evil demonic lord Ouks. 
 
The game is an RPG with an unusual side-scrolling perspective and action-based combat, somewhat of a 
cross between  Wizardry and platform games. Despite being a Japanese game, Sorcerian resembles 
Western RPGs of its time, focusing more on character development than story. In the beginning, the 
player creates a party of four characters, choosing between fighter, wizard, elf, and dwarf (races 
and classes are not distinguished). Beside the usual inns and shops, there are many things that can 
be done in the towns of the game, including complex development of magical spells (up to 120 spells 
of different disciplines), training to raise personal skills (strength, intelligence, etc.), 
enchanting weapons with elemental magic, as well as looking for part-time jobs. 
 
The view switches to side-scrolling when the party ventures into a hostile area. Combat is performed 
in real time, with the player controlling the entire party at once. The lead character can be changed 
at any time, and battle actions will be carried out by whoever is in front. Melee attacks and magic 
spells are unleashed by pressing corresponding buttons. The characters can also jump and interact 
with objects by bumping into them. Dungeons are usually maze-like, and some contain simple puzzles 
such as finding and activating hidden switches to open doors.

There are 5 levels of jump intensity, and the correct one must be used to clear each hazard and reach

The game uses an overhead view of the battlefield and multi-directional scroll. The gameplay is 
reminiscent of games like SWIV, but the need to rescue a certain number of hostages to complete the 
level adds a limited strategy element: the goal of the game is not to defeat the enemies, a task 
literally impossible as they re-spawn within seconds, but to rescue the hostages before being blown 
up.

other obstacles. The control method is much like "lunar lander" type games, but in zero gravity, so a 
quick thrust with the engines will move the ship indefinitely. Since you have limited oxygen and 
energy reserves, you must pick up oxygen bottles and energy canisters from the space stations you fly 
past. 
 
After the vertically scrolling space sequence, you jump out the ship and explore a space station. The 
control method is the same, and like before, you must keep an eye on oxygen and energy. Apart from 
said resources, the space stations have hidden treasures hidden below certain panels. Find treasure 
by gliding across the panels and pushing the joystick button. Certain panels will lead you to hidden 
treasure chambers. All the while, you must watch out for the space station's guardian, which moves in 
your direction when you activate your thrusters or press the button. As long as you just glide, the 
guardian stays put.

On the surface, Space Trouble looks like an orthodox shooter, but it has an unorthodox twist: Don't 
shoot! You navigate your ship through an asteroid field, with a finite fuel supply. From time to 
time, enemy ships come into view and try to hunt you down. Shoot them down, but bear in mind that 
each shot costs a little bit of fuel. Sometimes, you will encounter a fuel supply, and strewn 
throughout the game are powerups which boost your "flight record", which is turned to score as you 
complete a level. As the game progresses, the asteroids change into other obstacles, such as flying 
saucers, mines and organic blobs which take several shots to kill. Each enemy ship also has its own 
movement patterns, some hunting you down, some avoiding your shots, and some just bumbling straight 
forward. 
 
When you've passed four different fields, you encounter a mother ship. Docking with the ship requires 
minute precision, or you will crash and die. The ship teleports you to the next level, which is much 
like the first.

You're in a castle, where a series of magical phenomena have been taking place: a young girl and a

has adopted the form of an eagle and has also requested help of a legion of ghosts, monsters, demons, 
werewolves and other kinds of despicable creatures, that will try to avoid that we can reach their 
master. 
 
Once we get started, our immediate goal will consist in the following: In the first place, as every 
classic magician, we should go in search of our crystal ball. Once we have it, we are going to be 
able to see which are the movements of all the relevant personages in the story (the young lady, the 
armor and the eagle), also, it's going to show us where are the resting two elements required for our 
adventure: the magic wand (with which we will counter-enchant the girl) and the book of spells 
(essential to break the spell of the armor). 
 
Here it is where the graphical innovations of the program will occupy the an important place in the 
game. All these monitorings above mentioned are possible because the screen is divided in two zones. 
In the superior part we will see the adventures of our personage. Simultaneously, in the inferior 
zone, there will appear the exact place of the castle in which the object or personage we are looking 
for is located.

incorporated in the simulation logic. 
 
The game can generate random combat situations - for example, 6 enemies 10 miles away, 1500 feet into 
the air. Once you have established a strong flight record you can take on the missions. Additionally 
there are practice modes for both flying and combat.

Star Blazer is a basic side scrolling shooter in the style of the well known game Super Cobra by 
Konami. You are a fighter pilot on several hazardous missions. In each level you have to fulfill one 
mission like bomb the radar, destroy the tank etc. The scenery as buildings and warehouses and 
airborne objects as jets and rockets can all destroy your jet. Your fighter jet is armed with a 
limited supply of bullets for a on board machine gun and with bombs, also with limited supply. Bombs 
can only be dropped from very low altitude. 
Further, your jet has a limited amount of fuel which can be refueled by picking up a parachute 
dropped out of another plane.

The Blodroid Empire has launched a mass attack on Earth. Fortunately, its entire network of ships use 
shields powered remotely from a single generator located on their homeworld. As a feared pilot, you 
must fly your Astrohunter spaceship through hostile territory to destroy it. 
 
The journey is viewed from above. The threat is from nine increasingly-tough Supercruisers, which 
have the ability to launch spaceships, missiles and mines. These must all be avoided or shot out. In 
this part of the game, you have four lives, represented by shields which deplete as you take hits. 
 
The last Supercruiser contains the six all-important Generator panels. This final phase of the game 
takes place on foot, as you destroy them with projectiles. You must then return to your ship before 
everything explodes and takes you with it.

Steve Davis Snooker (c) 1988 CDS Software Ltd / Blue Ribbon Software Ltd. 
 
Mike Lamb recreated the basic rules of the popular English game of snooker in this simulation, which 
can be played by one or two players, but has no computer opponent as such, unlike the later 16-bit 
remake. 
 
Instead, you are scored based not only on how many points you score legitimately, but also on how 
many points you concede through foul shots, and how many shots you take in total. You always take the 
next shot, even if you've missed or fouled, so in a one player game the break-building strategies can 
be slightly more aggressive than in a real match, as there's no risk of leaving an opponent a chance 
 
As in the real game you start off by trying to pot a red (there are 10 or the real 15, depending on 
which mode you choose), and if successful choosing one of the 6 colours (by pressing the number 
corresponding to its points value). Once you've lined up the direction of the shot, you will have to 
set the speed, and then the spin.

As with the rest of the series, the game uses a largely visual system, in which a press of the fire 
button calls up a menu of options, such as 'examine', 'pick up' or 'cast spell. Selecting these calls 
up a sub-menu to choose what should be examined or thrown, which objects to combine, which spells to 
cast, and so on. The objects to be used include a chicken, a disguise and eggs. One new feature is 
that bolts of lightning are fired down at Magic Knight from the sky, and these must be avoided.

Strike Force Harrier (c) 1986 H&H&nbsp / Mirrorsoft Ltd. 
 
Rod Hyde was always determined to produce the most realistic and advanced flight simulations ever, 
and this early attempt at recreating the Harrier is an example of that. There are 3 skill levels, as 
well as two practice modes - one for the rudiments of flight and the other for combat. The 
action-centered nature of the title means that it can be seen as an advanced shoot 'em up rather than 
a pukka flight simulator. 
 
Acquiring a lock on enemy planes and tanks is made easier by the advanced targeting technology of the 
planes, and escaping enemy fire is aided by the vectored thrust system. Shooting out the tanks clears 
ground space to set up your own bases, which must then be defended. VTOL (vertical take-off and 
landing) is correctly implemented, although more traditional horizontal take-offs should be used when 
space permits. The full range of weapons are provided

Super Deform Snatcher (c) Apr 27, 1990 Konami Industry Co. Ltd. / Konami Industry Co. Ltd. 
 
The year is 2042, the stage is a huge futuristic city Neo Kobe. Among the remains of passengers who 
died in a plane crash, experts discovered a strange biomechanical organism. Recent events proved that 
it was not the only appearance of a "snatcher" -a robotic creature who can masterfully disguise 
itself as a human being in order to infiltrate and to destroy human society. Gillian Seed, a man who 
suffers from amnesia, remembers just this word: "snatcher". He joins the Junkers, a combat unit whose 
goal is to track down and to exterminate the snatchers, and is determined to find out the truth about 
those creatures and his past. 
 
"Super Deform Snatcher" is based on the same story as the more famous  Snatcher, but gameplay-wise it 
is an entirely different game: a role-playing adventure. You navigate your hero from top-down view, 
enter buildings and talk to people. In many locations you'll meet enemies who are visible on the 
screen. Upon contact with an enemy, a turn-based battle begins. You can choose to fire from a variety 
of weapons, and to target a specific part of the enemy's body. Targeting has a direct effect in 
battles: for example, shooting the enemy's gun will weaken it, destroying its wheels will prevent it 
from avoiding your shots to its face or body, etc. You gain experience points ("rank points"), 
improving in different categories (speed, defense, etc.). You also improve your weapon skills by 
continuously using the same weapon. 
 
Unlike "Snatcher" with its "serious" graphics, the characters in "Super Deform Snatcher" have a 
typically Japanese animé "super-deformed" style, which adds an element of a parody to the game.

This game is the sequel to Mr. Do's Wild Ride and the fourth title in the "Mr. Do!" series. You 
control Mr. Do, a clown, and guide him trough a field with varying elevation levels, with balls 
placed on it. You must collect those balls to replenish your weapon, a ball that you throw at your 
enemies. A trail (shown as a line) follows you while moving around. The area you moved turns gray and 
will be uncovered. All the balls in that gray area turn into cherries. And, if you do the same with 
the cherries, they will be upgraded to oranges. The oranges can be upgraded to lemons and finally the 
lemons upgraded to pineapples. Hidden under the field is a letter (in the shape of a coin), which can 
be used for the "EXTRA" at the top of the screen. When any of the letters that spell the word "EXTRA" 
are collected an army of enemies that follows you show up and one of those enemies holds the letter 
that you touched. 
To obtain the letter you must kill that enemy. Now you can collect the other letters. When you 
obtained all the letters that spell the word "EXTRA" you will receive a bonus. 
On the field are logs, which can be unleashed by walking next to the side that is propped up. The log 
rolls down and kills all enemies it rolls over. But be careful! It can kill you too! To continue to 
the next round, you can kill all enemies or collect all the balls or fruits.

SuperStar Soccer (c) 1987 Gremlin Graphics Software Ltd. / Gremlin Graphics Software Ltd. 
 
Much of the design and programming of Superstar Ice Hockey (by many of the same programmers) is 
revised to provide a six-a-side soccer game. You can control any combination of centre-forward, 
goalkeeper (on the C64) and manager. For much of the game you are merely the centre-forward as the 
action unfolds around you - don't be afraid to track back and help out. 
 
The ball sticks closely to a player, who can pass, shoot, head or bicycle-kick it. Goalkeepers are 
penalised for retaining possession for too long (a rule later adapted for use in real-life football). 
Match length can be between 6 and 90 minutes, by toggling the speed at which time moves. Fouls are 
fully implemented. 
 
Single matches can be played in the cassette version, but the disk version adds a full-season 
structure. 64 English teams are split into 4 divisions of 16, with a season consisting of either 7 or 
15 matches.

The Survivors (c) 1987 Atlantis Software Limited / Atlantis Software Limited 
 
Almost a thousand people have been trapped in a hibernation dome after a nuclear war. The player 
takes control over three droids and must use their abilities to rescue the survivors. 
 
Seen from a top-down perspective, The Survivors plays somewhat similar to Boulder Dash as the levels 
are filled with sand and rocks. Droid 1 is the only droid that can dig through the earth, Droid 2 can 
beam survivors to safety (by moving over them) and Droid 3 can push rocks (only one at a time). The 
goal in each of the seven levels is to rescue all survivors within the time limit, while paying 
attention not to trap or damage any of the droids. Removing sand or pushing around rocks might cause 
other rocks to fall down and crash the droids. There are also Guardian Droids whose circuits have 
been damaged by the nuclear fall-out, causing them to run rampant. They damage the players droids on 
contact.

and work with telex machine to gain information about possible suspects. 
 
The crime scene now includes two screens (street with Sydney's body and assassin's apartment). You 
should collect all possible evidence moving the marker on the screen and examining the objects 
scattered at the scenes as well as the body itself.

actions are possible here such as sending messages within Diamond Network to receive the replies, 
printing the notes, contacting other Police services to gain the new information, comparing the 
evidences, carrying out examinations such as autopsy, interviewing/checking the alibis of suspects, 
and arresting finally. To specify the subject for each action you should type it.

This game consists of two parts which can be played independently, all of being related to aim 
shooting. The second part does include a 1 or 2 players mode. 
 
In the first part you will have to shot at plates flying in the air, accounting for a total of 12, if 
you hit at least 6 the you will pass to the next round of this first part. You have 3 shots for every 
two plates, so you have to be effective on a regular basis. Once you have passed this round, you will 
have to aim at a total of 7 targets, your goal is to hit at least 3 of them, here you only have one 
shot available for each objective. If you are lucky enough, the stage will be restarted with 
increased difficulty. 
 
In the second part of the game your objective will be to protect a juicy cooked chicken to be 
mercilessly attacked by spiders or voracious wasps that emerge from everywhere. Your mission would be 
to shot at them before they can absorb its substance till just leaving the bones. But it will not be 
easy, as time goes on insects will be more numerous, so if you find it pertinent, you can request the 
help from a second player. Do not let them spoil your dish...

Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles (c) 1990 Konami Industry Co. Ltd. / Mirrorsoft Ltd. 
 
With April O'Neil held hostage by The Shredder's thugs, Bebop and Rocksteady, once again, it's up to 
the Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles to come to her rescue!  Play as all four of the turtle heroes, 
rescue April, and then rescue your sensei Splinter from Mecha-Turtles clutches than go after The 
Shredder deep in the bowels of The Technodrome itself. 
 
Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles is an action game based on the late eighties/early nineties cartoon 
series of the same name. Play as Leonardo, Michaelangelo, Donatello and Raphael (one turtle only, but 
the ability to swap between turtles at any time) as you save your friends and battle The Shredder and 
his cronies. There are no 'lives', as such - when you lose a turtle, he becomes 'captured', and you 
cannot use him again until you rescue him from a place hidden in the overworld. 
 
Gameplay takes place in two perspectives: a top-down view, which lets you run around and explore 
buildings, sewers and other places. When entering places from the top-down view, the perspective 
shifts to a side-scrolling view, where most of the battling takes place. In addition to each turtle's 
main weapon, sub-weapons (such as shuriken) can be acquired, to use at foes - these have a limited 
use.

Telebunny (c) 1984 Mass Tael Co., Ltd. / ASCII Corporation 
 
Telebunny is a maze game similar to Pac-Man, Turtles or Ladybug. 
 
Bunny and Turtle are trapped in a maze filled with fruit and dangerous snakes. At the start of the 
game, all fruits are disguised as hearts. When Bunny passes over a heart, the fruit (lime on the 
first level, then pears, apples and so on) is revealed. Turtle roams the maze, eating all fruit in 
his path. On some occasions, the heart turns out to be broken. Broken hearts are deadly to Turtle, 
but when a snake passes a broken heart, it is turned into a carrot. When Bunny eats a carrot, she 
turns into an alien and can destroy the snakes. If a broken heart is left alone, it turns into a 
fearsome mosquito which hunts down Bunny. 
 
The maze is filled with bridges and tunnels so that Bunny can escape the snakes. One of Bunny's 
abilities is to dig holes in the ground, to reappear in one of the tunnels. After a while, the holes 
fill with water, where the snakes may be trapped. The thirsty Turtle, on the other hand, just drinks 
up the water. 
 
Turtle is usually a free-roaming creature, but by holding down the fire button, Bunny can send 
commands to Turtle in order to guide him to the fruits. For each fruit that he eats, the name of the 
fruit is spelt out. When it is fully spelt, a door in the top of the maze opens. When Turtle passes 
through the door, you proceed to the next level.

The Franciscan monk Noni wants to join the Vitigudina order. To judge his valor, the order asks for a 
test of virtue: the monk has to collect weapons and use them to exorcise all the demons of a village. 
 
Temptations is a Spanish flick-screen platform game. The game is divided in a series of levels, each 
with a series of screens. The player controls the monk's movements with the ARROW KEYS or the 
JOYSTICK. Pressing the SPACE BAR or the FIRE BUTTON shoots the projectile weapon he is carrying. The 
friar is killed if he touches the demons or some of the screen objects. His movement has inertia: 
after landing on a platform he usually keeps sliding forward (that is something that must be taken on 
account when planning how to move from one screen to the other). Shooting choice spots on the screen 
reveals hidden power-ups that can be collected, and some screens require the use of a specific 
power-up to reach their exit. The game starts with 10 lives and has no form of saving progress.

The kingdom of Asgard is in danger and only one of its Gods has the sufficient power to save it: 
Thor, the God of the thunder. The origin of this danger has been the death of Balder, son of Odin, 
God of Gods, who died by means of a dagger involved in green leafs. But in this kind of mystical 
histories there is always a bad guy, Loki, who was the one in charge to order this murder after 
knowing the prophecy: the death of Balder would bring the decline of the Gods, that would be attacked 
by a litter of rabid wolves without mercy. And that is indeed what our protagonist must prevent. 
 
For it, he must destroy a series of eggs, where the components of the litter of wolves are being 
developed, which are located in a castle (where the game will take place) in the distant territories 
of Vendha, where the children of the devil Surtur guard them jealously awaiting for your arrival. 
Your means to end with them as well as with other smaller enemies, will be to project thunders 
against them, the blows of your magic hammer, and of course, your ability with the keyboard.

Time Gal (c) 1986 Taito Corporation / Victor 
 
The year is 4001. The evil Luna has stolen a time machine and plans to use it to take over the world. 
You are the Time Gal, a skillful and pretty scientist, and your mission is to chase Luna through 
different time periods, to get the time machine back, and to save the world. 
 
Created during the first age of "full motion" style, Time Gal is a conversion of an early arcade 
title. You watch animations of your heroine while she travels through levels, and overcome obstacles 
by pushing the correct button at the right moment. You can change directions, jump, shoot, etc., but 
everything is controlled during the never-ending fluent motion of the Time Gal. At certain points the 
heroine stops the time, and you have three choices to choose from.

Time Trax (c) 1986 Binary Design, Ltd. / Bug-Byte Software Ltd. 
 
Dark forces have set out to destroy the fabric of time, by opening eight space-time continuum 
portals. Each one is guarded by a great mind, who must have a relevant object returned to them before 
they will allow you to seal the portals. Doing this requires formulating a spell from the runes the 
Minds give you. 
 
All of this is played out in a combination of side-view action and icon-based object manipulation. 
Starting in your living room as you search for a weapon and its bullets, you move along a network of 
levels and ladders, avoiding or shooting the many foes you encounter. Pressing down and fire together 
brings up a menu allowing you to pick up items, swap them with Guardians, and cast spells (with the 
chance to test them first).

Treasure Island (c) 1986 Byron Preiss Video Productions, Inc. / Idealogic S.A. 
 
Jim Hawkins is a young boy working on "Admiral Benbow", his parent's inn. One day a sea captain named 
Billy Bones takes a room at the inn and stays for several months. A blind man called Pew arrives and 
shows something to Billy that gives him a heart attack. Jim witness everything and runs to aid the 
captain, who tells him about his sea chest and his relationship with Captain Flint, a famous pirate. 
After her dies Jim grabs the key dangling from the corpse and opens the dead captain's chest to 
collect the last payment. He finds a packet inside, and decides to take it to two aristocratic 
acquaintances of his, Dr. Livesey and Squire John Trelawney. They discover a diary and a treasure 
map, and decide to travel to the island in search of the booty. 
 
Treasure Island is a text adventure, an adaptation of the homonymous classic 1883 Scottish novel. 
Unlike the book, the game is written in second person. Otherwise, it follows the original plot 
closely: the player assumes the role of Jim Hawkins, and has to perform the same actions as the 
character in the novel. This leads to a more claustrophobic design, as players without knowledge of 
the book have to guess what to do next. To help alleviate that problem, other characters act as some 
sort of on-line hint system. The player can ASK them ABOUT anything and they will provide clues when 
these are available. The parser accepts most of the Infocom's standard features like pronouns and 
chain commands.

Trivial Pursuit (c) 1986 Oxford Digital Enterprises Ltd. / Domark Software, Inc. 
 
This is the earliest home computer incarnation of Horn Abbot International Ltd's classic board game, 
Trivial Pursuit. The game involves answering questions on one of six subject categories to gain 
moves, and answering questions on special squares to gain one of the six 'Wedges' you need to gain 
the right to take on the final winning question. Questions are aimed at British players - many 
entertainment questions are based on British TV, and sport questions relate to popular British 
sports. 
 
Two game modes are available:- single player (which involves answering questions against the clock) 
and multiplayer (where you can take on up to five human-controlled players). The computer reveals the 
answer, and you select 'yes' or 'no' to tell it whether you got it right. 
 
The question categories are exactly the same as the board game, however two different question styles 
are added to take advantage of computer technology - some questions relate to a picture or diagram 
and some relate to a piece of music. 
 
One additional feature not available in the board game is a statistical analysis of the number and 
type of questions answered correctly. This can be split into the performances of all the players, or 
the performance of an individual player within the six categories. It is especially useful at the end 
of the game, when choosing which category a player must answer to win the game.

Life has never been too quiet in Marrakesh, but lately things have been getting harder.  Ait-Amar, 
the daughter of the sultan, has been kidnapped by a group of Berbers and they are forcing him to give 
half of his fortune within three days. 
 
But as you know, with every kidnapping of a princess there's always an hero ready to rescue her, and 
Ben-Yussef, our protagonist, has been the chosen one this time to get into the labyrinthine and 
dangerous Kasbah in order to affront the kidnappers and rescue the handsome daughter of the Sultan. 
 
As expected, it will be a hard task, because although there are some local residents willing to give 
clues in exchange for some coins, others will try to steal everything they can. Besides these two 
types of Moors, deep in the Kasbah there are women to which you can steal their money, policemen that 
will take your weapons, and thugs who are at the doors of the houses that you must enter in order to 
find the princess. 
 
Like any human being, Ben-Yussef must replenish his strength in inns and restaurants and rest in 
hotels or hostels, implying a significant economic outlay. You can also buy new weapons in the 
armouries prepared to this effect, bearing in mind that depending on the neighborhood, these elements 
may also vary in price.

Turmoil (c) 1983 Sirius Software, Inc. / ASCII Corporation 
 
Turmoil is a fast-paced shooter. You pilot a ship that is trapped within a chamber of seven tunnels.  
Your ship can only move up and down along a vertical corridor connecting the tunnels.  You are not 
alone, however.  A variety of enemies travel along these tunnels, focused on destroying you.  
Therefore, the ultimate objective of “Turmoil” is to zoom up and down the center alley and blast 
aliens as they streak by.  Keep shooting and keep moving, and you will survive to live another day!  
As you move quickly up and down, you must also fire your own weapons into to the left or right side.  
Part of the intensity of this game is driven by the fact that you can't stay in one place for too 
long.  If you do, an indestructible enemy will come flying at you, forcing to move onward once more. 
 
The enemy ships you will encounter in each of the seven tunnels travel at a variety of unique speeds. 
 The faster a given enemy moves, the more points you will receive if you shoot them.  Occasionally 
when you destroy one of the enemy ships, a flashing orb will appear at the far end of the tunnel.  
This is the one exception where you are not restricted to your vertical pathway.  In these situations 
you are allowed to move down the tunnel to recover it.  If you grab it quickly, it is worth bonus 
points.  If you hesitate, it hatches into a fast moving missile and will destroy you if you get in 
its way. 
 
When you start a game of Turmoil, you are given five ships.  If you can blast all of the aliens in a 
level, you'll receive a bonus ship.  In addition to your current ship, you can hold as many as six 
reserve ships at one time.  You will loose a ship if you make contact with any of the passing aliens. 
 There are nine levels to the game, each with multiple waves to complete, and each one faster and 
more challenging then the previous level.  This is considered by many to be one of 20th Century Fox's 
best games.

Uchi Mata (c) 1987 Martech / Martech 
 
Uchi Mata is a unique tournament-based Judo fighting game in which you play as a judoka in the 
ultimate tournament. 
 
The game is played from a non-scrolling side view. You control your fighter and attempt to get within 
striking distance of your opponent, however you don't attack directly with your attack button. 
Instead, your attack command puts you in a fighting stance that allows you to input a series of 
directional moves. That, combined with the correct feet placement of both fighters (which can be seen 
in a helpful window) allows you to unleash specific throws and offensive maneuvers that form the 
basis of the combat in the game. A stamina and health bar also keep your attacks in check, as you may 
need to rest and build up your strength in order to perform effective attacks.

Ultima IV: Quest of the Avatar (c) 1987 ORIGIN Systems, Inc. / Pony Canyon, Inc. 
 
The fourth game in the now well-established Ultima series featured an improved game engine, with 
color graphics and better character interaction (you could now have actual conversations with NPCs). 
But what really makes Ultima IV shine is its radical departure from any other RPG made before or 
since in terms of the story and goal. 
 
Instead of building up your character by any means possible in order to face the Ultimate Evil in a 
big bang up showdown, in Ultima IV you were trying to become the Avatar, a role model of sorts for 
the people of the land. This meant upholding the "eight virtues" and basically trying to become a 
better person. In most RPGs you chose to be a just/nice hero because the people you'd help would 
usually provide you with some nice equipment for your services, but in Ultima IV you helped people 
not for a reward or to advance the plot but simply because it was the "right thing to do". The game 
actually frowns on behavior that was typical of most other RPGs, such as backstabbing fleeing 
monsters or picking up everything that wasn't nailed down even if it didn't belong to you. The game 
keeps track of all your actions, so if you went about killing and looting like in most RPGs, you'd 
never finish the game. 
 
This VERY different approach to the game's ultimate goal is what makes Ultima IV famous so many years 
later, and became the sort of design philosophy that made all the following Ultimas so unique in 
their genre. 
 
Of course, the game still has plenty of traditional RPG elements such as dungeons to explore and 
hostile monsters to kill, as well as a typical final "Holy Grail" type quest where you had to find 
the Codex of Ultimate Wisdom to complete your transformation into Avatarhood.

goals of the joint venture was to explore the possibilities of transdimensional voyages to the 
nearest star system, Alpha Centauri. Six years later, a prototype of the transdimensional drive was 
completed. Test pilot Jim Benson is to take the craft on its maiden voyage. In a technical mishap, 
too much energy is injected into the drive, and the Einstein-Rosen bridge doesn't work out as 
calculated. Instead, Jim ends up in an unknown part of space unidentifiable to the board computer.

As a game, U:U owes much inspiration to Konami's classic Nemesis games for the MSX. Horizontally 
scrolling (albeit at a jittery pace, due to being programmed for the MSX1), your sole spaceship must 
shoot down wave upon wave of alien enemies. Killed enemies often leave behind upgrade capsules for 
your weapon. The weapons are similar to Nemesis, containing both bullets and lasers as well as bombs

VENOM Strikes Back is a single player side scrolling, two dimensional, shoot-em-up. It is the third 
game to be based on the popular MASK comics, TV series, and books of the mid 1980's. 
 
The M.A.S.K., Mobile Armored Strike Kommand, organisation led by Matt Trakker, are battling the 
criminal organization known as V.E.N.O.M., Vicious Evil Network of Mayhem. Combat in the previous two 
games has been based around the transformer like vehicles used by M.A.S.K., not so in this game. 
In this game Matt's son has been kidnapped by V.E.N.O.M. and has been taken to the moon. Matt has 
been given an ultimatum, disband M.A.S.K. and leave the world at the mercy of V.E.N.O.M., or never 
see his son alive again. 
 
Matt sets out for the moon where he must overcome the defences of V.E.N.O.M.'s base, rescue his son 
and steal a rocket back to earth. 
In his quest he is helped by special masks that give him special powers. For example one mask will 
give Matt the ability to shoot bullets others will allow him to fly, pass through solid objects, 
float across bodies of water, have temporary invulnerability and so on. However, Matt can only carry 
four masks and can only use one mask at a time. Each mask has just 99 units of energy, or bullets, 
and this number is reduced each time the mask is used so eventually the mask will need replacing. 
 
At the end of each level as Matt progresses to the next the player gets a code word. This codeword 
can be typed in when the game is re-loaded allowing the player to restart at the new level.

In the intergalactic war, the Amstradian empire has taken over most of the known universe. Earth is 
still putting up some resistance, but is running out of natural resources. It is discovered that the 
old mining planet of Vestron contains a special kind of crystals which can be substituted for oil. 
Retrieving these crystals is imperative for Earth to be able to keep on fighting, so you are sent 
alone to recover the energy source from Vestron. 
 
The game is made up of two different screens. On the static screen, you fly around in your space suit 
right above the surface, where crystals can be found. Pick up the crystals while avoiding the 
Amstradians, which luckily move back and forth in preset patterns. If you run the risk of a 
collision, you can press the space bar to activate your Asteroids style emergency teleport. This 
feature should be used only as a last-ditch effort, since you could just as well teleport straight 
into another enemy. You can travel up, left and right, to travel down you just let gravity do its 
job. 
 
After having retrieved the crystals on the static screen, you progress to a scrolling screen which 
takes you to the next crystal site. In order to get through this screen, you must avoid all the 
Amstradian ships which attack in a kamikaze fashion. Reflexes are a requirement, since the enemies 
move very quickly and track all your movements.

Voidrunner (c) 1987 Llamasoft Ltd. / Mastertronic Ltd. 
 
The final conflict in the droid wars is up ahead in Jeff Minter's Voidrunner, the second sequel to 
Gridrunner. After the defeat in the Matrix wars the droids are out for revenge, preparing a nuke to 
destroy the earth. Therefore a corps of pilots are sent to the droid home planet with the objective 
to eliminate every single droid. 
 
Gameplay is similar to Gridrunner. Like in Centipede, the enemies move in a pattern down the screen 
and the player have to shoot them before they reach the ship. There's also the zapper, a vertically 
moving line, that occasionally pulses. If the player ship is on the same line when this happen, it 
will die. 
 
The enemies come in many different flavours. The most common ones just explodes when hit, bouncing 
predictable around the screen. We also have the Gridrunner style aliens that when hit leaves a pod 
that needs to be destroyed. Typical for a Minter games, you'll also fight furry animals like camels 
and goats. 
 
New in Voidrunner is that you don't just have one ship, but four. In early levels the ships will move 
around in a cluster. Later in the game some of your ships will have inverted motion. Some of these 
formations will have the ships shooting in different directions. Handy when you have enemies coming 
in from behind.

Volguard (c) 1985 dB-SOFT / dB-SOFT 
 
Volguard is a traditional shoot'em up, from the days before R-Type or Nemesis. You fly a plane over a 
parallax-scrolling landscape, filled with enemy installations which you must bomb. An easy task, if 
it weren't for the enemy attack waves. Most waves consist of planes flying in a straight line across 
the screen, without even shooting at you. Others bounce across the screen, and some are quite deadly, 
flying in intricate patterns and firing multiple shot. Of course, you can fire back, but keep that at 
a minimum. The power bar at the bottom of the screen is depleted by your cannon, and when it has 
reached zero, your firing rate is very low. Save those shots for difficult enemies, when you really 
need that rapid fire! After a while, a route camerade will join you as a kind of power-up. When a 
third plane joins, you may merge your fighters into a flying robot.

Wacky Darts (c) 1987 Big Red Software / Blue Ribbon Software Ltd. 
 
The bar-room game of darts involves aiming small projectiles at a circular board. The board is 
divided into 20 shapes around the edge, each of which has a value from 1 to 20 points, a special 
'double' area around the edge, and a special 'treble' area in the middle (each of which multiply the 
shot score). There is also a Bullseye right in the middle for 50 points, and an Outer Bull around it, 
worth 25 points. 
 
Players always take three shots at a time. In the 501 game the aim is to reduce your score from 501 
to 0, finishing with a double or the bull. If your score reaches 1 or a negative number, any shots in 
that set of 3 are cancelled out. In Round The Board you must hit each target in turn starting with 
20, but moving back 2 or 3 for a double or treble, eventually finishing with Double Top. 
 
Both of these games are recreated in this simulation. The movement of the cursor you use to aim is 
slightly skiddy, to recreate natural jitters (or, as some would cynically suggest, the effects of 
being as drunk as most darts players). 
 
Wacky Darts lives up to its name by featuring an assortment of human, alien and machine opponents of 
varying difficulties. Each of them has a short profile, and use a different object to hit the board.

Warroid is a game that pits two players (or one player and the AI) against each other in a robot 
versus robot fight. The objective: shoot the enemy warroid until it has no energy left. Destroying 
the enemy warroid will give the player one point on the six-point scale (the player starts out with 
three points each). When all points are lit in the player's color, the player wins the game. 
Controlling the warroid is easy, since it will always point its gun towards the enemy droids. Just 
push the space key to shoot a lot and jump away from the line of fire. There are multiple 
platform-like levels for the player to fight in. 
 
A menu (called up by pressing the escape key) will let the player customize the game so as to set 
handicap and the colours of the player's warroids.

sections, so the fourth section is identical to the first, the fifth to the second, and so on. 
 
As the game goes on, the bonus time offered for each section drops, so you have to drive better as 
the game goes on to stay in. Night is represented as well, with everything darkened and the need for 
headlights. The circuit features barriers and trackside trees, so avoid contact with these, and try 
not to stray onto the grass as this slows you down.

Winglancer (c) Aug 30, 2002 
 
Winglancer is an attempt to create a so-called "mania shooting game" for the MSX2 (and subsequently 
Windows). Mania shooters have been popularised by Cave and can be characterized as vertically 
scrolling shooters with an emphasis on putting as many bullets on screen as possible. In order to 
make a game where the screen is often covered with bullets playable, your "hit box" is not your 
entire ship, as in the shoot'em'ups of the eighties and early nineties. Instead, only a small box one 
or a few pixels in size is your sensitive area, and bullets may otherwise pass right through you, as 
long as they don't pass your sweet spot. 
 
Despite its modern play mechanics, Winglancer has a consciously retro look, similar to the classics 
such as Galaga or Galaxian, including a score panel occupying a large part of the screen. 
 
Winglancer has five stages, three ships with various weaponry and speed, four difficulty levels 
ranging from "easy" to "god" and two rounds in which to clear the game. It also has a boss mode, 
where you only train yourself against the game's bosses, one after one. Apart from your ship's main 
weapon (choose from power, wave or laser), you have three smart bombs per life. From time to time, 
you will find bonus bombs coming down the screen. When enemies are shot, they will sometimes release 
a star. When picked up, the star will render you invincible for less than a second – enough time to 
move through a particularly tricky bullet pattern.

Wizardry: Proving Grounds of the Mad Overlord (c) 1987 Sir-tech Software, Inc. / ASCII Corporation 
 
The first Wizardry game was one of the original CRPG dungeon crawlers, and stands along with  Ultima 
and  Might & Magic as one of the defining staples of the genre. You generate and control a party of 
up to six different adventurers and send them into a 3D vector dungeon to fight monsters and find 
treasure. 
 
The game takes place in the domain of Trebor, the titular Mad Overlord. Trebor was once only 
power-mad, but went off the deep end after he acquired a magical amulet of immense power only to have 
it stolen from him by his nemesis the evil archmage Werdna. Werdna, not quite sure how to use the 
amulet properly, accidentally causes an earthquake which creates a ten-level dungeon beneath Trebor's 
castle. To avoid looking silly, Werdna declares the dungeon to be the new lair for him and his 
monster hordes. Trebor, not to be outdone, declares the labyrinth is in fact his new Proving Grounds 
where adventurers must prove themselves for membership in his elite honor guard (and incidentally 
retrieve his amulet in the process). Thus your goal in the game is to descend to the tenth floor of 
the labyrinth, defeat Werdna, and retrieve the fabled amulet.

Building on the basic gameplay and visual ideas of Ultimate's Atic Atac, Wizard's Lair stars explorer 
Pothole Pete, who is stuck in the Lair unless he can find all four pieces of the Golden Lion. The 
game is viewed slightly top-down, with indoor rooms bordered by line drawn vectors rather than the 
fuller jungle graphics. 
 
The pace of the game is quite fast, and the challenge of the action elements is increased by not 
having infinite weaponry. The route through the game is non-linear, with multiple exits and secret 
rooms commonplace. Although the screens always contain a particular area, rather than the sections of 
different areas viewed in Atic Atac (which meant that you'd often have to work out how to reach some 
sections via other screens), a river is a central aspect of the layout, and delimits some sections of 
the screens.

The Worm in Paradise (c) 1985 Level 9 Computing, Ltd. / Level 9 Computing, Ltd. 
 
Eden has been successfully colonised, by creating several domed cities. Society is rigidly 
functioning, unemployment, crime and poverty all non-existent. The economy functions on fines rather 
than taxes, making for a plethora of petty rules and no penal punishment. Robot employees make 
everything run cheaply. Body part reselling allows hospitals to turn a profit. Robots can even 
control human reproduction. The end result is a society in which humans have no useful role. Who 
would live in a 'paradise' like this? 
 
The Worm In Paradise is the culmination of the Silicon Dreams series of interactive fiction. The game 
relies on strict timing and a day/night cycle (using a decimal clock with 10 100-minute hours) – 
return to your home before darkness falls, and don't expect robots to help with tasks which will not 
be finished in the day. Vital buildings can be located using colour-coded co-ordinates, but these 
change every time you load the game, so be careful to write them down.

Three years have passed since the brave young warrior Latok Kart defeated the evil demon Badou,

Necromancer, has escaped. He plans to summon another dark being, known as the Gospel, from the demon

way to the village of Banuwa, hearing the rumor that Latok's long lost father has been seen nearby... 
 
Rising of the Redmoon is the sequel to  The Art of Visual Stage and the second entry in the  Xak 
series. The gameplay is nearly identical to that of the predecessor: Latok wanders through hostile 
areas, fighting enemies in real-time melee combat, gaining experience points and leveling up. A few 
options have been added, such as praying to Duel, a legendary god of war, to restore hit points.

The events of this game take place shortly after the hero Latok defeated the demon Gospel in  Xak II: 
The Rising of the Redmoon. Latok hears rumors about a man who looks exactly like him and was last 
seen near an old tower infested by monsters, which nobody dares enter. Latok and his girlfriend Fray 
arrive at the tower entrance and meet their friends there. Latok decides to venture into the tower 
with just one companion, unaware of the fact that the "false Latok" was just a trap set by powerful 
demons, intended to lure him into the den of evil. 
 
Xak Precious Package: The Tower of Gazzel is a side-story in the  Xak universe. It differs from the 
main  Xak series in several gameplay-related aspects, even though graphically it is very similar to 
the previous Xak games. Most importantly, Tower of Gazzel is not an RPG: Latok begins the game with 
maximized parameters and can not become stronger. The combat is similar to other Xak games: Latok 
attacks enemies with a sword in real time, and receives damage when they touch him. Tower of Gazzel 
is much more oriented towards puzzle-solving than the previous games. The entire game takes place in 
the tower, which is a huge maze containing various obstacles that the player must find solutions for 
(locked doors, seemingly impassable areas, etc.). Latok can jump over some dangerous spots (such as 
poisonous puddles). An important gameplay element is Latok's companion. Each of the four available 
companions has a different ability: for example, Fray can cast spells, Pixie can handle certain 
mechanisms in the tower, etc. In order to solve many of the puzzles, it is necessary to bring the 
right companion to the spot and let her take care of the problem.

Xanadu: Dragon Slayer II (c) 1987 Nihon Falcom Corp. / Nihon Falcom Corp. 
 
The second game in Nihon Falcom's Dragon Slayer series is, like its predecessor, a dungeon-crawling 
RPG with action combat. You are a nameless apprentice fighter who must venture into the depths of a 
cave system beneath the town and become stronger by fighting the creatures that lurk there. When you 
come into contact with an enemy, you enter a separate battle screen with multiple enemies. You attack 
enemies by simply bumping into them. You'll take damage if the enemy attempts to attack you from the 
sides or from behind, but if you are stronger than the enemy, you'll damage it by frontal attack. 
Killing enemies gives you experience points and treasure. In the town, you can train separately 
either one of your main parameters (strength, dexterity, charisma, etc.), spending your experience 
the way you like.

Xenon (c) 1988 Bitmap Brothers, The / Melbourne House 
 
Xenon is the obscure and mysterious predecessor to the much better known Xenon 2: Megablast. The game 
is actually nothing like its sequel, with completely different control scheme and gameplay. The plot 
overlaps however, with the Xenites making their first attempt to control the galaxy. 
 
Xenon is essentially an overhead shooter, where the player controls the ship and moves around the 
screen. However, the difference between Xenon and its sequel is that here the player actually 
controls the movement of the playfield (up or down) by simply moving the ship in the direction of 
choice. To do this in the sequel, players need to slam your ship against the bottom of the screen and 
pull back on the stick in order to reverse-scroll the playfield. 
 
It also features a 3D playfield (some enemies, for example, will be mounted on hills of sort, where 
players can't shoot them). To combat these the player can transform its tank into a plane. The game 
then switches to the more familiar gameplay style as seen in other vertically scrolling shooters. The 
plane has to transform back into a tank again to combat most ground units. 
 
In Xenon, upgrades are taken from destroyed enemies.

Xevious: Fardraut Saga is a vertically scrolling shooter and another installment in the Xevious 
series which started in 1982 when Xevious was introduced in arcade halls. 
 
The story of Xevious: FS is that a large number of UFOs have been reported above the South American 
continent. The player's duty is to reconnoiter the identity of the unidentified objects and the 
underground building located at 72.26. 
 
The Recon squadron has been mashed up to the last Solvalou. Moreover, we succeeded in developing a 
transformed type named "Gampmission". That is basically a combination of three fighters which are 
Solvalou, Solgrado and Zeodalley. By introducing this new machine we obtained the sinews of war which 
is needed in order to counteract increased enemy power. Now the battlefield of the Xevious army has 
been extended. Thus, we are in a critical condition. 
 
We will start operation of mash the Xevious army. Good Luck.

Tetsu is a young warrior who has left his home country in order to serve human rulers in their battle 
against the dark elves. But one day the valiant knight was heavily wounded in battle. Unconscious, he 
was found by a female fighter named Mei, who brought him to her house and cured him. Grateful, Tetsu 
promises Mei to help her venture into the huge tower standing nearby, which was built by the princess 
of the country and is now overrun by monsters... 
 
X·na is a dungeon crawler very similar to early  Dragon Knight games, but without erotic content. 
Most of the activity in the game takes place in the gigantic maze-like tower. The player has to 
explore it, finding the correct way to upper floors (without auto-map feature). In town, it is 
possible to buy weapons and rest. The player controls only Tetsu and Mei during the entire game, as 
they fight random enemies in turn-based combat, gaining levels. The combat system is very simple, 
relying on preparation and level-building. Mei can cast healing magic, which depletes magic points 
(MP).

Gauntlet-style underground mazes, killing the bad guys and collecting health and other bonuses from 
flying saucers (underground? SLIGHT logic gap there, methinks).It's designed to be played 
co-operatively, although bullets from one player can harm the other. 
 
The Xybots are out to stop you, of course, and many have advanced attack patterns as well as bullets 
to fire at you. Being able to view round corners is useful, allowing you to plan a strategy - often 
it's good to send one player forward and let the other play the waiting game, as in Gauntlet.

Young Sherlock: The Legacy of Doyle (c) 1987 CCS / Pack-In-Video Co., Ltd 
 
On the December of 1875, a millionaire called Doyle was murdered and Cindy, his daughter, was found 
at the crime scene. Roger, her fiancée, hires a young Sherlock Holmes to clear her name and help on 
the investigation. 
 
Young Sherlock is a japanese adventure based on the 1985 movie Young Sherlock Holmes, although it has 
a completely different plot. Controlling Holmes and Watson, the player must investigate the murder of 
a millionaire by questioning witnesses and investigating parts of London. The screen is divided in 
three parts: a window at the bottom for text output, and above it a illustrative picture and a verb 
list. Actions are performed by selecting a command from the verb list with the arrow keys and hitting 
return or the space bar to execute it. The verbs are, from top to bottom: walk, examine, talk, 
listen, show, take, inventory and use. 
 
When the player walks from one place to the other, the picture portion transforms into an overhead 
map of London where a red square shows the position of Holmes and Watson. The player can move this 
square with the arrow keys, and position it over an interactive area to access it (the game writes a 
small description of the places the square touches).

This is the second game in the long-running Ys action RPG series. A bright light shot up from Dahm 
Tower in the end of the first game, and our hero Adol Christian is awakened by a young girl who finds 
him lying on the ground. She introduces herself as Lilia and tells Adol he is in the land of Ys. 
Finally he was able to establish a connection between his world and this mysterious land! But finding 
the gateway to Ys is not enough: Adol must stop the evil entity that his archenemy Dark Fact served. 
And his foes already know where he is... 
 
This game is a direct sequel to what PC players know as  Ancient Land of Ys (of which the original 
NES version was simply called Ys), and is also the same game (story-wise) as the second part of Ys: 
Book I & II for TurboGrafx CD. The gameplay utilizes an unusual action RPG combat style, where you 
don't press any attack button, but run into your enemies in order to cause damage. You should choose 
the angles and the measure of contact with the enemy carefully, otherwise you'll be dead. You can 
(and should) level up, perform quests for village people, gather money, and upgrade your weapons and 
inventory, like in any other RPG.

Ys III breaks away from the "bumping into enemies" battle system of the first two games and allows 
Adol to control his sword in a variety of directions.  As well as changing the battle system, the 
game is now side scrolling instead of the previous games top-down view. Adol also now has the ability 
to jump.  Not new to the series is the use of magical rings which give Adol different powering up 
abilities such as healing and shielding.  The game also uses various key items found along the way to 
solve minor puzzles and progress the story.

wizard Dark Fact (Dulk Dekt in Sega Master System version, Malificus in PC version). It is your task

Ys is an action RPG with original combat: instead of pressing the "attack" button, you simply run 
into the enemies you encounter. You do more damage if you run into them from the back or from the 
sides - a head-to-head collision might result in Adol's death if the monster is stronger than him.

limit to complete your task, you need to avoid the flames and sparks which wander about the maze. 
From time to time a number will appear in a maze section and count down from 9 to 0. If you touch the

Zona 0 (c) 1991 Topo Soft / Topo Soft 
 
A directly TRON-inspired (though unlicensed) variety of the snake game, Zona 0 puts the player in 
control of a "light cycle" that zooms across an enclosed grid with other bikes, each leaving 
impassable lines in their wake.  As the play field gets cluttered up with these trails, it gets more 
and more difficult to avoid accidentally driving in to one, veering sharply with 90-degree turns.  
The player's goal is to outlast the computer-operated light bikes, proceeding to the next level.

Zork III: The Dungeon Master (c) 1983 Infocom, Inc. / Infocom, Inc. 
 
In the third game of the famous adventure game series  Zork, you are once again a nameless 
adventurer, only this time you won't travel through a beautiful magical land, but are immediately 
cast into a deep dungeon. Like in a dream, you hear a mysterious voice telling you that you have 
passed all the tests but one. When conscience returns to you, you find yourself on the endless spiral 
of stairs, with only your trusty lantern near you... will you be able to survive the horrors of the 
Dungeon? 
 
Like its predecessors, "Zork III: The Dungeon Master" is a text adventure game. You read descriptions 
of rooms and then interact with the game by typing commands. As all early Zork games, it is very easy 
to get stuck in the game, so you'll have to reload several times in order to find the correct way.

Zork: The Great Underground Empire (c) 1983 Infocom, Inc. / Infocom, Inc. 
 
Zork: The Great Underground Empire is a classic text adventure game.  The player begins as an 
"adventurer" standing near a white house in a nice forest, but soon descends into the Great 
Underground Empire, where most of the game takes place. The player's quest is to collect the Nineteen 
Treasures of Zork. 
 
As was typical for adventure games of its era, Zork does not use graphics. Instead, it communicates 
with the player via text, and the player interacts with the game by typing commands, such as "examine 
mailbox" or "take torch". For movement, the player types in geographical directions (such as "north" 
or "east" - or just "n" and "e"), and can check what items are being carried with the "inventory" 
command (or just "i"). 
 
Zork was ported over from mainframes in the late 1970s. It is one of the first "text adventures" and 
is widely considered to be one of the great classics of the genre which reached the peak of its 
popularity in the '80s.
