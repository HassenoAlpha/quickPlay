2020 Super Baseball (c) Jul, 1993 Pallas / 
Tradewest, Inc. 
 
In the year 2020, baseball finally evolved. There 
is no longer conventional professional baseball in 
2020. Baseball designed by the Super Baseball 
Association has been very popular and is the best 
sport. 
 
However, the truth is that the association has 
used a colossal sum of money to promote Super 
Baseball as show business. They have manipulated 
each player's ability using the control computer 
to secretly decide victory or defeat in every 
game. The players who knew this removed the 
connecting parts of the computer to play their own 
game of baseball. Finally, a fair game is going to 
be played at Cyber Egg Stadium. 
 
In 2020 Super Baseball is a fast-paced game with 
new rules, where you can select 1 of 12 individual 
men, women, or robot players. During play, you can 
make your team stronger with prizes earned from 
amazing catches.

3x3 Eyes - Juuma Houkan (c) Dec 22, 1995 Banpresto 
Co., Ltd. / Banpresto Co., Ltd. 
 
The game is based on the manga series 3x3 Eyes. 
Long time ago, in ancient China, a group of people 
discovered the secret of immortality. They became 
San Zhi Yan (Sanjiyan in Japanese pronunciation), 
or "three-eyed ones", and possessed supernatural 
powers that were manifested in a third eye each 
one of them had. One of the San Zhi Yan, a girl 
named Pai, longed to become a normal human again. 
She was aided by the Japanese scientist and 
explorer Fujii, who mysteriously disappeared in 
Tibet some time. Fujii's son, Yakumo, became 
connected to Pai by merging his soul with her and 
becoming a wu, an immortal being. Now they both 
travel around the world, trying to regain their 
human essence, and having their base in Hong-Kong, 
working for Li Lingling, the head of the Monster 
Fighting Agency. 
 
This game follows the story of volumes 8 to 11 of 
the manga. Lingling discovers a letter left by 
Fujii, where he reports about a strange tribe that 
can control beasts. Yakumo is ordered to travel to 
Nepal, but first he has to find more information 
about the mysterious tribe by contacting people in 
Hong-Kong. 
 
The game is a mixture of puzzle-solving adventure 
and platform action, with the emphasis on the 
first. Yakumo moves around the gameworld, picking 
objects and manipulating them in order to solve 
puzzles, and talking to characters. But he can 
also jump, climb on ladders, run, and sometimes 
fight enemies in platform-style.

3x3 Eyes - Seima Kourinden (c) Jul 28, 1992 Yutaka 
/ Yutaka 
 
Based on the manga series 3x3 Eyes (original 
Japanese name Sazan Eyes) by Yuzo Takada, the game 
tells the story of a young man named Yakumo Fujii. 
He lives in Tokyo and enjoys a life of an average 
teenager: studies in school, works as a waiter on 
a part-time job, hangs around with friends, and so 
on. But one day, he meets a mysterious girl named 
Pai. Pai is the sole survivor of an ancient race, 
called San Zhi Yan - Chinese for "Three Eyes". 
Long ago, they discovered the secret of 
immortality, but as a result they lost their human 
form, and some of them mutated into horrible 
demons. Pai's dream is to become human again. 
Yakumo's father was her trusty friend, but he 
died, and wished his son would continue helping 
Pai. At first Yakumo doesn't feel very 
enthusiastic about that, but through a bizarre 
accident his nature becomes inseparable from 
Pai's, and he becomes immortal himself! He has no 
choice but to help Pai. They travel around the 
world, from Hong-Kong to Mexico, seeking their 
lost humanity, and fighting the remains of the 
demonic race. 
 
The game is a console-style RPG set in modern 
times. You can travel from location to location by 
plane, or riding Pai's winged demon. On your 
journey Yakumo and Pai meet other character who 
join the party, and visit cities and dungeons, 
where they fight enemies in turn-based style. 
Battles are viewed from first-person perspective. 
Every character has various spells and techniques 
which can be used in battles.

combat initiates. Combat is turn-based, depending 
on which character you choose, your combat will 
either be almost entirely melee or magic-based. 
Potential enemies wandering around the world 
cannot be seen, however a radar map helps indicate 
enemies as as white dots.

Acrobat Mission (c) Sep 11, 1992 UPL Co., Ltd / 
Teichiku Co., LTD. 
 
Years ago humanity abandoned the over-polluted 
Earth to make a new home on Mars. Now, without 
warning, a mechanical moon has appeared in the 
skies over Mars, and is raining down destruction 
on the colonies. A plan is hastily put into action 
to destroy the moon and its armada of space-craft. 
Due to the impossible task of surviving a direct 
assault, the mission is code-named Acrobat 
Mission. 
 
Your spaceship in Acrobat Mission is capable of 
firing a single straight ahead shot. By picking up 
a Wide upgrade, more shots are added that fly off 
at an angle, and the shot can be charged up to 
unleash a continuous short range cone of energy. 
Picking up a Hurricane upgrade will cause bullets 
to circle you defensively before shooting forward, 
and charging will store a full round of bullets up 
to be fired straight ahead all at once. Up to two 
bombs can be held at once, and if an enemy bullet 
hits a bomb it will detonate, saving your ship 
from damage. If your ship is hit, however, then 
you will have a few seconds to ram it into 
whatever shot you and take them down with you. 
Unlike most scrolling shooter games contact with 
an enemy ship will not kill you, but they can 
still push you into the path of bullets. 
 
Play takes place over five levels, first of your 
launch on Mars, then the approach to the moon, and 
finally infiltrating the base to destroy its core. 
Each level ends with a unique boss except stage 4, 
which ends with 3 bosses.

ActRaiser (c) Nov 01, 1991 Quintet Co., Ltd. /

ActRaiser was one of the early SNES games, drawing 
upon the success of side-scrolling platform action 
titles and the building model of Sim City. You 
play "The Master" (essentially God), and must save 
the world from evil. 
 
First you purge the land by sending your spirit 
into a warrior with a big sword and magic powers. 
This side scrolling portion puts you in many 
different locales, from swamps and forests, to 
pyramids and snowy mountaintops. 
 
As you eliminate evil from different parts of the 
land, you allow villagers to return and build 
their towns. You then control an angel who helps 
guide the villagers in their town building, and 
can send down miracles to aid them in their needs.

Konami Co., Ltd. / Konami (America), Inc. 
 
Konami's game based on the 90s animated series 
starring the Caped Crusader sends him against his 
most famous enemies in a platforming/beat'em'up 
title. 
 
Each of the game's eight levels (or episodes) 
sends Batman against one particular villain. Most 
levels present Batman with a large number of 
henchmen to take out and environmental dangers to 
avoid on his way to one or more boss battles, but 
some deviate from the norm. For instance, 
Catwoman's stage is a large chase over Gotham 
City's rooftops with no enemies besides Catwoman 
herself. In the Penguin's level, Batman must 
navigate the dark corridors of Gotham City's 
museum, rescuing the staff. Two-Face's level is a 
driving sequence, seen from a top-down 
perspective. 
 
Besides kicks, throws and punches, Batman can use 
a variety of equipment against the enemies. Always 
available are Batarangs and the grappling hook. 
Before each mission, Batman can also select 
additional equipment, like knockout gas spray, 
throwing stars, smoke bombs and plastic 
explosives, all with limited ammunition. Special 
equipment required for certain levels include a 
flashlight, gas mask and X-ray goggles. If some 
necessary equipment is missing, it is always 
possible to return to the Batcave to change the 
gear and then restart the current level. 
 
Many of the situations and environments of the 
levels are based on episodes from the series and 
the game's graphics emulate the animation and 
drawing style of the show.

The (c) Jun, 1993 Imagineering Inc. / THQ Inc. 
 
The Adventures of Rocky and Bullwinkle is the 
video game adaptation of the 60's cartoon series 
staring Bullwinkle, a moose, and Rocky, a flying 
squirrel.  The game plays out much like an episode 
of the show.  The story begins at the dedication 
of the Frostbite Falls Rocky and Bullwinkle 
museum.  Unfortunately, the not-so-nice Boris and 
Natasha have disguised themselves as security 
guards for the museum and managed to steal some of 
the priceless artifacts. 
 
Bullwinkle and Rocky must track down the stolen 
artifacts and return order to Frostbite Falls.  
Most of the action is of the side-scrolling 
platformer variety, but along the way, you will 
get to play lots of mini-games involving 
characters from the show. During the platforming 
sections you can switch instantly between the two 
protagonists. Both play differently: Bullwinkle 
can throw bombs at enemies and Rocky can fly for 
short instances.

Adventures of Tintin, The - Prisoners of the Sun 
(c) 1996 Infogrames Europe SA / Infogrames Europe 
SA 
 
The Adventures of Tintin: Prisoners of the Sun is 
based on the Belgian comic book of the same name. 
The basic plotline is the same: Professor Cuthbert 
Calculus gets kidnapped and the player, in the 
role of Tintin, needs to rescue him. The rest is 
more loosely adapted: in contrast to the comic, 
which is mostly based in Peru, this game offers 
many different locations all over the world. 
 
The gameplay itself is a typical platforming 
action: Tintin walks through the levels while 
avoiding the enemies. Pretty much everyone, e.g. 
little girls and security guards, is out to hurt 
Tintin who has no means of defending himself. This 
means the most important aspect is learning enemy 
placements, their patterns and how to avoid them. 
But he has to hurry because of the time limit. 
Required for success is the usage of the two 
playing plains: from the player's perspective in 
the foreground and further towards the background. 
Tintin can switch between the two at any time.

behind them. The only way out is the way down, 
into a dungeon filled with monsters, traps and 
puzzles.

You are the CEO of an airline company. Your goal 
is to become the most successful airline in the 
world by connecting all 22 cities with air routes, 
maintain a profit, and meet the required quota of 
passengers. If you cannot turn a profit for a year 
or meet the victory conditions in 32 years you 
lose. Some strategic decisions you must make 
include negotiating for open air routes, 
purchasing or selling aircraft, invest in branch 
offices and hotels, advertise your airline and set 
budgets. You must also pay attention to statistics 
like quarterly and annual sales reports, as well 
as city data. World events also affect your 
airline, from natural disasters to war and even 
the Olympic games, all of which will affect how 
many passengers you get. All the planes in the 
game are based on real-life aircraft, such as the 
Boeing 747 and the Concorde.

Disney's Aladdin is based on the 1992 Disney

development was handled by Capcom. Like other 
versions, the game is a side-scrolling platformer 
where the player controls Aladdin through 
locations from the movie like the city of Agrabah, 
the Cave of Wonders, and Jafar's palace. Some 
locations not appearing in the film include a 
trippy, candy-colored world inside the Genie's 
lamp and an ancient pyramid. Enemies standing in 
Aladdin's way include the Sultan's guards, animals 
and various magical creatures. They can be 
dispatched by jumping on top of them or by 
throwing apples at them. Besides jumping and 
throwing, another one of Aladdin's abilities 
consists of him pulling out a blanket and using it 
to slow his fall. 
 
Besides the platform levels, the game also 
includes magic carpet rides as well as a bonus 
game played between levels: if Aladdin collects a 
golden scarab in a level, he can play a wheel of 
fortune for extra health, lives or continues.

Albert Odyssey (c) Mar 05, 1993 Tokai Engineering 
/ SunSoft 
 
The town of Gouto hosted a miraculous artifact, 
the Key of Resurrection. The evil wizard Oswald 
invaded the town with his army of goblins and 
dragons. Three brave knights went out to defend 
the homeland, and one of them was killed in 
battle. His wife and his daughter Sophia left the 
house crying, but Oswald was already in the town, 
and with one strike he killed Sophia's mother... 
 
Fast-forward ten years. In a nearby town lives a 
young brave warrior named Albert. He just turned 
sixteen, and he undergoes an initiation as a 
descendant of brave heroes of the past. Meanwhile, 
Sophia became the court wizard of the kingdom. She 
hasn't forgot the murder of her parents, but she 
needs the help of a brave warrior like Albert to 
avenge their death and to stop Oswald... 
 
"Albert-Odyssey" is a console-style strategy RPG. 
The story is told in cut-scenes between battles 
and traveling within towns. World map and dungeons 
are handled as huge battlefields, where your party 
moves in turn-based style, waiting for the enemy 
turn until you can perform your next action. 
Enemies often come in large groups, and strategic 
positioning of your party members on the battle 
field plays an important role.

chaos and destruction to the world. A single 
swordsman stood in defiance. The four powers that 
protect the world, the Guardians, gave him their 
power, and with it the swordsman slew the demon 
and restored peace in the world. 
 
Thousand years have passed. And a new battle is 
already on the way. A cruel emperor leads his 
troops towards conquest. The kingdom of Panakeia 
is defending itself with the aid of its knights. 
Once again, the ominous star shines in the sky,

Empire's evil plans and to destroy Alcahest once 
again.

enough experience from fighting, you gain extra

the way you'll meet some characters who will join 
your party for short time, and you'll be able to 
use their special attacks and magic.

Angelique (c) Sep 23, 1994 KOEI Co., Ltd. / KOEI 
Co., Ltd. 
 
In every sector of the Cosmoc, there is a queen 
who rules over it, keeping the powers of the 
elements in balance with the help of the Nine 
Guardians. But with time, the queen's power fades, 
and a new queen must replace her. Several 
candidates compete until one of them proves that 
she has the knowledge of the nine elements and has 
convinced the Guardians to lend their power to 
her. The heroine of the game is a 
seventeen-year-old Angelique Limoges, and her main 
adversary is a rather unpleasant girl named 
Rosalia. Will Angelique be able to befriend the 
Guardians and become the next queen? 
 
Angelique borrows elements from different genres: 
Japanese-style adventure (without puzzles), 
"dating sim", and (not overly complex) strategy. 
The goal is to make sure that Angelique has good 
relationship with the Guardians, maintaining the 
balance. For that, Angelique has to visit them 
daily, talk to them, and see what effects their 
powers have over the land. The situation is 
further complicated by the fact that Angelique - 
depending on the Zodiac sign the player chooses 
for her - has a certain affinity with one of the 
elements, and therefore, with one of the 
Guardians. This can lead to a love relationship, 
which will forfeit Angelique's chances to become a 
queen, but deliver an ending which can still be 
considered satisfying.

Long time ago, an evil sorceress Castomira decided 
to conquer the world. But a good princess revolted 
against her, and in a great fight defeated the 
sorceress. But in order to completely seal the 
sorceress' powers, the princess had to forge a 
magic sword. For a long time this sword guarded 
the peace of the citizens of Arcus. But now the 
followers of Castomira stole it, and the world is 
facing a great peril... 
 
This is a  Gauntlet-like game: lots of action and 
magic, with items to collects, and many dungeons 
to free from monsters. The game is also viewed 
from an isometric perspective, typical for the 
genre. Choose one of four characters to battle 
your way through dungeons and castles, or play 
with a friend in a 2-player mode.

Aretha (c) Nov 26, 1993 Japan Art Media / Yanoman 
Corporation 
 
In a far away land, war was raging, as an evil 
ruler sent his troops to invade the castle of a 
mighty king. His minions stormed the castle and 
burnt it down. The king could not escape his fate, 
and the villain thought no one was spared by his 
wrath... 
 
Present time. You are Ariel, a little girl who 
lives with her old wise grandmother in a small 
house near a mountain range, north to the forest. 
She just turned ten, and the grandmother sends her 
on a seemingly simple quest: to go through the 
forest to Nineveh, the nearby town, and to meet 
there a certain person. But what starts as a 
simple assignment soon develops into the quest for 
magic powers of Aretha, the ultimate battle 
against the evil, and the discovery of Ariel's own 
true identity. 
 
The game is a console-style RPG, where Ariel and 
her party travel on the world map, through 
forests, mountain paths, and caves, occasionally 
visiting towns and fighting monsters in turn-based 
combat viewed from first-person perspective, using 
a variety of physical and special attacks.

Aretha II - Ariel no Fushigi na Tabi (c) 1994 
Japan Art Media / Yanoman Corporation 
 
The game continues the story of the young princess 
Ariel. After she rightfully regained her throne, 
people enjoyed a peaceful life under her 
benevolent reign. But this peaceful existence did 
not last long... Two adventurers who were 
wandering through mountains met a mysterious evil 
being, who threatened to ruin Ariel's kingdom. 
After that, the two men disappeared without a 
trace. Ariel's servants reported to her about the 
matter. After consulting her wise grandmother, 
Ariel decided to go out herself, to meet up with 
her old trusty companions and to find out the 
origin of the new threat. 
 
The game is a console-style RPG - you fight random 
enemies in turn-based combat viewed from 
first-person perspective. Enemies may attack you 
from the sides, and you should pay attention which 
enemy you face. A unique feature the game uses is 
the ability to get special items called "souls" 
after battles, and then to use them to forge your 
own armor.

Armored Police Metal Jack (c) Jul 31, 1992 Atlus

Kikou Keisatsu Metal Jack is a scrolling brawler 
based on the anime of the same name. At the start 
of the game the player can choose from Red Jack, 
Silver Jack, or Blue Jack. Red and Silver both 
have weapons they can find ammo for in levels (a 
gun and baton, respectively), and all three can do 
a multiple hit combo or a jumping attack. At the 
end of a level the Jack will be met by his vehicle 
which will then merge with his armor. In this form 
the Jack's attacks are strengthened and he can 
charge up an attack that hits every enemy 
onscreen. 
 
There is no story told at any point in the game, 
so if you want to know what's going on you'll have 
to track down the anime.

A.S.P. Air Strike Patrol (c) 1995 Opus Corp. / 
  SETA U.S.A., Inc. 
 
Playing as a jet pilot of the "Coalition" force, 
players take control of either an F-15 Eagle, or 
an A-10 Tankbuster jet. The mission is to 
neutralise the offensive forces of the Zarak army, 
who have recently invaded a smaller neighbouring 
country. The Zarak army has many ground units, 
including tanks, stinger-missile launchers, SCUD 
missiles and armored vehicles. 
 
To accomplish the ultimate goal of defeating the 
Zarak army, players venture out on numerous 
missions (called "sorties") that have varied and 
specific objectives. Typically, various 
installations such as radar sites, air bases or 
ground units are the target. Other missions 
include disabling an oil-pipeline and destroying 
SCUD launchers before they fire. 
 
Pre-mission screens ask the player to select 
   from the two planes. Then,  the player can 
   specify the armament to carry into the sortie. 
   Air-to-ground and air-to-air missiles are 
   available for each of the planes. Here, a 
   strategic choice between countering either air 
   units or ground units has to be made, as each 
   area (of which there are eight) is patrolled by 
   opposing enemy F-15 jets. 
 
The game is played through the 
isometric-perspective, and the plane's speed and 
direction can be be adjusted in real-time. 
Altitude however, is fixed. A missile/bomb-target 
is constantly shown on the ground before the 
plane, allowing players to aim at units, or, with 
the F-15, a lock-on targeting system is available. 
 
The game also makes use of a briefing before each 
mission, and also a further briefing by an 
animated colonel on the tarmac just before 
take-off. Various debriefing screens are shown 
also, and, if the player attains a certain strike 
rate, a "GNN" news story may play out. For each 
mission, a time-limit and minimum destruction-rate 
must be met. You can take-off as often as need be 
to attain this.

Bahamut Lagoon (c) Feb 09, 1996 Square Co., Ltd. /

The kingdom of Kahna is in great danger. The evil 
Emperor Sauzer, obsessed by his world domination 
ideas, is preparing to invade the kingdom. The 
king sends his best troops of knights and wizards 
to face the enemy, but in vain - the kingdom is 
conquered by Sauzer, the king is murdered, and his 
lovely daughter is kidnapped. You were brave, 
Leader of the Dragon Squad, but now you will have 
to become strong. Remember the promise you gave 
the princess long time ago: always to be at her 
side. Supported by his friends and by his faithful 
dragons, you must now free the princess and the 
kingdom from the enemy's hands. If only the 
strongest of the dragons, Bahamut, could be 
awakened... 
 
Bahamut Lagoon, created by the company which gave 
us the Final Fantasy games, is a mixture of 
turn-based strategy and RPG. Control several 
parties of four characters each, and command 
different dragons at once. The battles start on a 
top-down screen typical for strategy games, but 
often switch to a dynamic "platform" view, such as 
used in early console RPGs. You also can influence 
the game by other strategic activities, such as, 
for example, setting a whole forest on fire, to 
prevent enemies to come through it.

Bakumatsu Kourinden Oni (c) Feb 02, 1996 Pandora 
Box / Banpresto Co., Ltd. 
 
The game is set in the end of Edo period in Japan 
(1600-1868). Japan, controlled by the feudal 
rulers (shoguns) of the Tokugawa dynasty, consumed 
by a peaceful sleep for three hundred years, was 
awoken by the arrival of the Westerners. It seemed 
that they only wanted the end of Japan's isolation 
from the rest of the world. But their true purpose 
was to take control of a mysterious Japanese 
energy source called reiketsu. To protect those 
sources, that were running dry during their three 
hundred years-long reign, the Tokugawa Shoguns 
formed the famous Shinsengumi special force. In 
addition to its primary mission of clearing out 
forces that would try to overthrow the shogunate, 
there also existed a special branch of them called 
"Shadow Shinsengumi". The duty of the "Shadow" was 
to take care of "those things the human hand 
cannot manage"... 
 
You control Yamatomaru, a strong-willed 
sixteen-year-old boy who lives in Iida village, 
near Koufu. His father has recently passed away. 
After failing to defeat a monster in his village, 
he was saved by one of the Shadow Shinsengumi man, 
Mibu Juurota. As he receives his father's katana, 
he goes on his first mission - rescuing boys who 
were trapped in a mountain path. Soon the plot 
thickens and the young hero becomes involved in 
mystical struggles between the forces who try to 
control reiketsu... 
 
The gameplay is similar to  Dragon Quest  series 
and other console-style RPGs: the battles are 
random, turn-based, and are viewed from 
first-person perspective. You fight using physical 
attacks and a variety of special moves based on 
spiritual energy. An unusual addition to the 
gameplay is the karma system. By doing good deeds 
you can increase your karma level, in an  
Ultima-like way. This way you get more money and 
precious items from fighting monsters, and your 
special powers increase in strength. If you don't 
show compassion, steal people's things and lie, 
your karma will decrease, you won't get money from 
random battles, and some people will attack you.

Productions / Hi-Tech Expressions, Inc. 
 
Help Barbie become a great fashion model!  This is 
an arcade game with many different activities to 
participate in. 
 
In each level, Barbie starts by going left to 
right with forced scrolling.  She has a default 
speed and can speed up as well.  She must avoid 
moving obstacles by moving up and down and 
controlling her speed.  If she hits one, she loses 
a chance and it's game over if she runs out of 
chances.  She must pick up items which grant point 
bonuses and extra chances. 
 
There is also a camera item to pick up which 
brings you to a magazine cover shoot.  You are 
shown a cover with barbie wearing an outfit which 
is themed to the level.  You must then go to her 
dressing room and dress her in a matching outfit.  
You are also given separate control of the colors 
of three different components and must match 
these.  You are awarded points for each correct 
match. 
 
When you reach the right side of the level, you 
are given a runway practice.  This consists of 
four positions on the runway floor labeled to tell 
you which button you must press at each one. 
 
Barbie then goes back through the level 
right-to-left.  On the return trip, there is a 
handbag to pick up.  This brings you to another 
magazine cover.  You then go to a makeup mirror 
where you must match Barbie's hairstyle, earrings, 
eyeshadow and lip and nail color to the cover.  
Again, you are awarded points for each item which 
you get correct. 
 
When you reach the left side of the level, you 
must then do Barbie's runway walk that you were 
given earlier.  You are awarded points for each 
station at which you perform the correct move. 
 
Barbie then continues to the next level.  There 
are a total of four: Barbie driving down the 
street, skating on the beach, walking through a 
ski resort and walking through the park.

Barbie Vacation Adventure (c) 1994 Software 
Creations Ltd. / Hi Tech Entertainment 
 
In Barbie Vacation Adventure, Barbie, along with 
her friend Midge in two-player mode, travels 
around the country to four different vacation 
spots, each with its own set of mini games. 
 
In Iowa, at a county fair, Barbie must catch an 
escaped pig by walking up to it and pressing the 
action button, after that she can play carnival 
games.  The options are a strength test, knocking 
down cans and a hit-the clown game.  In the latter 
two, players can  aim balls with the d-pad, then 
throw with the action button.  Leading targets is 
required.  The strength test has a mater that goes 
up and down and Barbie must land her hit when the 
indicator is on the bell to ring it. 
 
In Wyoming, Barbie goes camping.  First, she must 
assemble her tent.  This is essentially a jigsaw 
puzzle.  Next, she must jump from rock to rock to 
get to the other side of the park where she can go 
on a nature hike.  In the next segment, players 
aim a camera cursor at animals as Barbie walks 
along the path and hit the action button to take 
photos.  This requires good reaction time. 
 
There's a ranch in Texas where Barbie can ride 
horses.  The horse runs on its own.  The player 
pushes the action button to make it jump.  There 
are numerous gates on the course and the player 
must time jumps correctly to clear them.  If they 
hit too many, they must start over.  There is also 
the option to play horseshoes.  The cursor moves 
about erratically and you must press the action 
button when it passes over the stake. 
 
In Florida, Barbie can play volleyball against 
Midge.  This game allows both players to play 
simultaneously in two-player mode.  Barbie and 
Midge can move forward or backward on the court 
and hit action to set the ball.  First one to ten 
points wins.  There is also a diving segment where 
barbies must navigate an underwater maze to 
collect sunken treasure. It might remind some 
people of Barbie's Ocean Discovery. 
 
Finally, there is Barbie's home in California.  
Ken has hidden presents around the house and 
Barbie must find them and identify them by shape.

Bassin's Black Bass is a fishing game endorsed by 
the professional fishing champion Hank Parker. It 
is another entry in Hot-B's long line of fishing 
games. Players aim to become a professional 
fisherman and can travel by themselves or along 
with Hank. 
 
There are four different fishing areas players 
advance to as they win each round of the 
tournament. Players travel by boat on the water, 
select a fishing spot and then select lure and 
cast fish. Certain types of fish are only 
available at specific spots. There is also a fish 
radar that makes a sound when there is fish 
nearby. Players need to select the correct type of 
lure (there are about 20), keep track of weather 
conditions and the limited time available in 
tournaments. Some fish fight back hard and need to 
be reeled in with careful timing. 
 
The four tournaments are Local Amateur Tournament, 
Amateur Bass Championship, Pro Bass Tournament and 
Bassin' World Championship. About eight types of 
fish can be caught.

Bass Masters Classic (c) Jun, 1995 Black Pearl 
Software / Malibu Games 
 
This game consists of five 3-day tournaments at 
four lakes. The mission is to catch as much large 
bass as possible. Once the day of the fishing 
tournament is over, the five largest bass that 
were caught get weighed and are compared to the 
other fisherman's catches. The one with the 
heaviest catch is the winner. 
 
The player starts off choosing an angler. Then the 
player can either go to the bait shop, practice 
pond, or start in the tournament. In the bait 
shop, choices of baits, lines, rods, reels, fish 
finders, and boat engines are available for 
purchase. The practice pond mode is just where the 
player can cut his teeth on the game mechanics 
without consequence. 
 
The tournament mode is the main part of the game. 
Players start out in a fishing boat. Some of the 
factors that can affect your fishing are 
temperature, wind speed, water clarity and time of 
day. After casting the line, the game goes from an 
above the lake view to a side view of the lake 
water depths. Then it's just up to the player to 
attract the fish with the bait, and after the fish 
is caught on the hook, reel it in.

Batman Returns (c) Apr, 1993 Konami Co., Ltd. / 
Konami (America), Inc. 
 
The successful movie sequel Batman Returns spawned 
many different game adaptations. The SNES version 
presents the story of Batman's encounter with the 
Penguin and Catwoman as a side-scrolling 
beat'em'up, with one Batmobile driving sequence 
thrown in. 
 
There are two varieties of the beat'em'up levels. 
One plays like Final Fight and similar games: 
Batman can move in two dimensions, beating up his 
enemies with various punches, kicks, combos and 
special moves. 
Special gadgets to be used include the famous 
Batarang to take out enemies from a distance and 
"Test Tubes" filled with chemical explosives which 
will damage all enemies on the screen. 
 
In the second type of side-scrolling level, Batman 
can only move in one dimension, left or right. The 
Batarang is the standard weapon here, with punches 
only being used when the enemy gets close. Also in 
these levels, Batman can use a grappling hook to 
cross dangerous areas unharmed. 
 
Enemies in the beat'em'up levels usually belong to 
the Penguin's Red Triangle Circus Gang - clowns in 
all varieties: thin clowns, fat clowns, clowns on 
bikes, clowns armed with bazookas, and more. At 
the end of each level there is a boss fight, 
including several encounters with Catwoman and the 
Penguin. 
 
In the Batmobile driving level, the action is 
viewed from behind. Batman has to evade clowns on 
bikes and shoot them down when he gets the chance. 
At the end of the road, another boss fight awaits. 
 
Digitized images from the film illustrate the 
storyline.

Disney's Beauty and the Beast begins with a 
narrative that parallels the 1991 animated film-- 
an enchantress transforms a mean prince into a 
beast until such time that he could learn to love. 
One day, a woman named Belle happens into his 
castle. The Beast must pursue her through his own 
deadly castle for both their safety. 
 
This is a side-scrolling action platformer. The 
Beast is rather slow but with a powerful claw 
strike and jump-stomp attack. He can also scale 
certain types of walls and can catch the edges of 
platforms. He also has a special roar that allows 
him to stun certain enemies. This becomes 
necessary in some sections in order to freeze bats 
so the Beast can use them as stepping stones to 
higher platforms. 
 
The game has a time limit in the form of the 
magical rose. The Beast must battle through such 
levels as the dungeon and the main hall battling 
giant spiders, rats, rogue candle monsters, live 
gargoyle statues, and enchanted brooms, while 
collecting books for points (since Belle likes 
books) and magic mirrors that allow the Beast to 
see further into the current level to anticipate 
what challenges await.

Highland Hospital and the Turbo Mall 2000 and the 
final level at the concert.

will roam through the halls, cafeteria, and 
gymnasium. At the end of each level Beavis and

Couch fishing involves trying to catch as much 
food as possible until either the time runs out or

raise their health meter for the next level. 
 
The boys will pick up weapons such as paint-ball 
guns to take on various enemies. There is also

enemy you meet and LaShawn uses powerful 
cartwheels. Enemies such as animatronic robots and 
security guards must be taken out in the first

Robin.  There is also a haunted house maze level

Beethoven's 2nd is a platform game where you get a 
chance to wear the metaphorical shoes of Beethoven 
- that lovable, big dog from the movie. 
 
Your four puppies need to be rescued and brought 
back to their mom. As a responsible father and 
guardian you'll first need to find the puppy, 
avoiding dangers such as bad-tempered cats, mean 
dogcatchers, acorns which have a habit to drop 
down just when you pass underneath, and careless 
skateboarders. You can bark at these opponents to 
scare them away. And if you'll find a source of 
water (such as a rubber hose), you can make 
yourself wet and then - in a tense situation - 
shake off the water, eliminating everyone in the 
vicinity. 
 
Once you find your pup, you'll find out that 
getting him back to his mom is no easy task. While 
your puppy can - thankfully - walk on his own 
accord when you put him down, you'll still have to 
carry it over obstacles, and you'll be forced to 
fight all the enemies again while doing it.

On day an alien race of slugs is out patrolling

person with his hands extending towards the sky. 
Seeing this logo, the slugs determine that ours is 
a race made up of BONES and of ADVERTISING, two 
things the slugs simply hate. So they attack. 
 
With the slug invasion in full swing, earth is 
quite simply outnumbered by the gooey slugs. It 
must recruit special super soldiers, Big Sky 
Troopers, armed with a special heavily armored 
suit to combat the menace. So urgent is the need 
for qualified Big Sky Troopers, that recruiting 
and rank are petty things. It is not unknown for 
example for a brand new trooper to start as a 
21-star general in the army. 
 
Once selected, it is up to your Big Sky Trooper, 
piloting a FIDO class starship, to engage the 
slugs in space and in planetfall and thwart their 
plans to destroy mythical galactic devices and 
conquer humanity.

Bishoujo Senshi Sailor Moon - Another Story (c) 
Sep 22, 1995 Angel / Bandai Co., Ltd. 
 
The game is based on the Japanese manga and animé 
series Bishoujo Senshi: Sailor Moon - "Bishoujo 
Senshi" roughly meaning "Pretty Young Girl 
Warrior". It is set in the 30th century, in a 
futuristic city Crystal Tokyo. In this city lives 
a totally ordinary (at first) fourteen-year old 
girl Usagi. When she meets a magical cat named 
Luna, she finds out that she is in fact a princess 
sent to the future in order to fight the minions 
of Darkness. She discovers within herself the 
power to transform into the hero of darkness, 
Sailor Moon, meets other warriors who help her on 
her quest, and fights the evil Queen Beryl, 
hostile aliens, and other foes. 
 
The events of this game take place shortly after 
Bishoujo Senshi Sailor Moon S, the fourth volume 
of the long-running series. A global peace is 
established in the universe, but lately suspicious 
things are happening. A strange meteorite is seen 
approaching the Earth. Street gangs and spies who 
work for a mysterious person called Apsu are seen 
in Crystal Tokyo. And the Mystic Silver Crystal, 
the Ginzuishou, which protects the city, is 
shaking! Usagi and her friends must now 
investigate the strange events and face the forces 
of Darkness once again. 
 
The game is a console-style RPG in  Final Fantasy 
style (battles with your party to the right and 
the enemies to the left), with a battle system 
somewhat similar to that of  Chrono Trigger: you 
must form a party out of several available 
characters, make them participate in battles 
together, and learn powerful combo attacks.

Ryu was a young boy who has memories of a strange 
village far away and a magical doorway which 
sucked him through. However those are only distant 
memories. Ryu and his best friend Bow are 
apprentices in the Ranger's Guild. As adventurers 
they take on posted jobs needed by the 
townspeople. However it isn't long before one job 
goes awry and Bow is accused of stealing a 
valuable item. In order to clear his friend's name 
and find the meaning of his dreams, Ryu will 
explore the world, eventually discovering the 
meaning of his dreams and hidden abilities inside 
himself. 
 
Breath of Fire II is a role playing game. The 
majority of game is played from a top-down map, 
however battles are seen from an isometric view. 
Ryu will form parties from among 8 other 
characters, each with their own set of skills and 
powers that will help him discover the truth 
behind the mystery. 
 
In the GBA version, you can use a link-cable to 
link to a friends and exchange weapons and items 
to defeat the higher evils. And with the inclusion

In this bowling game, players create a bowler in 
order to play against eleven professional bowlers. 
Players can choose their bowler's clothes, what 
hand they use to bowl, the spare ball and primary 
ball they want to use, and also the weight of the 
balls. 
 
The game offers practice, tournament, and league 
modes. Practice mode is just a quick game of 
bowling by yourself. In league mode, players can 
either compete by themselves or as a team against 
other bowlers. Finally, the tournament mode 
features six different tournaments to compete in. 
A short or long tournament determines the number 
of players that will be involved in the tourney. 
 
Before hitting the lanes, the player will be 
informed of the oil pattern of the lane which 
tells the player how the ball will react to that 
lane. Bowling is performed by choosing where to 
stand, then using the two meters that determine 
the amount of power and spin the ball will have 
when it's finally released down the lane.

The world of Kypros is populated by many races: 
humans, intelligent reptiles, dog-like wosshus, 
and others. There are also many gods in Kypros. 
Not all the gods could accept the peaceful 
co-existence of creatures in Kypros, and Daar, the 
god of darkness, plotted evil schemes until he was 
defeated and sealed by the god of light, Risk. 
Years have past, and the evil demon lord Bido is 
trying to resurrect Daar. According to an ancient 
prophecy, only eight heroes, the bearers of magic 
pearls, can stop Bido's evil plans: eight heroes 
who come from different parts of Kypros, unaware 
of their great mission. Among those heroes are the 
young pirate Zan Hayate, the fighter of the wosshu 
tribe Gonza and his little sister Maimai, the 
beautiful sorceress Lilian Lancelot, and others. 
 
Before the eight heroes unite for their ultimate 
journey, you play their introductory stories. You 
travel on the world map, visiting towns and 
dungeons on your way. The combat is turn-based, 
viewed from first person perspective. Enemies 
appear randomly. Each hero has his/her own unique 
techniques to use in battles. 
 
The story and general gameplay of Hachigyoku no 
Yuushi Densetsu is similar to those of the 
original  Burai: Jouken for PC-98 and MSX

/ SETA U.S.A., Inc. 
 
The people of Bizyland were hard-working and 
prosperous. However, Wagamama, the queen of 
Lasyland was jealous and used the power of her 
magic mirror. The spell that was cast would switch 
the realms of Bizyland and Lasyland around. The 
only people left unaffected by the spell were 
those who were not hard-working: notably the king 
of Bizyland as well as two children and a robot 
who were playing that day. Using the king's magic 
chalk, they must travel over Lasyland and restore 
enough of a percentage of each area so as to break 
the spell over each region. 
 
Cacoma Knight is a puzzle-painting game. Choosing 
one of the three characters, the player will begin 
each level only able to move around the edges. The 
player can start using the chalk to move away from 
the edges and draw a line over the darkened area 
and reach another edge. Once a section (always the 
smaller) is "chalked off" from the rest, it will 
be restored. Any treasure chests revealed will be 
opened for points bonuses. Different enemies will 
walk along the chalk lines or fly in between them. 
They can be destroyed by being in a section of the 
screen when it is restored.

Guide a team of up to four soldiers through 72

button to move them to a particular spot, and the 
right button for them to fire guns at an enemy. 
You can also pick up grenades, which can be used 
to destroy groups of enemies or buildings (by 
pressing both buttons at once). 
 
Each mission has a specific objective, and some 
feature vehicles such as tanks to make things 
easier. Your troops can cross water but can't 
shoot within it, so finding and controlling 
bridges is often crucial. You can use the 
arrangement of trees to find hiding places to 
shoot from, and should watch out for CPU soldiers 
also doing so.

1vs1 dogfights, strafing runs on enemy ships, dive 
bombing on enemy ships, torpedo runs on enemy 
ships and carrier landings. All missions are made 
up of these elements, however campaign missions 
also feature the ability to decide which aircraft 
to bring into battle, each with it's own 
statistics, and keep track of progress on an area 
map. When two forces engage each other on this 
map, players can choose which plane to bring into 
battle and it will close in a 1vs1 battle with the 
enemy. In dogfights, both players control an 
aircraft whereas during ship combat, one player 
controls an aircraft and the other will control 
the ship's turret gun. Aircraft controls include 
being able to tilt left and right, climb, dive, 
increase speed, decrease speed, fire guns, release 
bombs/torpedoes (if present) and do a 180 degree 
loop. Turret controls are more limited, only 
allowing the player to aim left and right, fire 
the gun and zoom.

Championship Pool (c) Nov, 1993 Bitmasters, Inc. / 
Mindscape, Inc. 
 
Championship Pool is a pool game where players can 
8-ball or 9-ball pool tournament that starts off 
with the BCA Regional Championship where the 
player must defeat 32 opponents in a first to four 
games match. If the player loses against any of 
the 32 opponents, they are then eliminated from 
the tournament. The winner of that then goes onto 
the World Championship. 
 
All of the gameplay is done from a top down view 
of the table. The player moves an icon to indicate 
location they want to hit the ball too. To aid in 
the aiming, a ghost of the cue ball and the first 
ball that is hit is repetitively played out to 
show the path of the hit ball. With the all the 
shots there is a very small margin of error, but 
this is only notable when a long shot is played or 
a shot from a sharp angle and the ghost balls will 
randomly play out all the possible occurrences. 
The player can also change the power and spin of 
the played shot with the ghost balls will updating 
to show the outcome of those changes. 
 
There are 4 different game modes that can be 
chosen, each with a different set of pool games. 
The different game modes and there games are: 
 
1. Tournament: The player must defeat 32 
   different players in a first to four knockout 
   tournament in 8-ball or 9-ball pool before 
   going on to the World Championship. During the 
   tournament the opponent is never actually is 
   seen playing there shots. Instead, when it is 
   the opponents turn, it cuts to an image of the 
   player with a caption and then returns the 
   control to the player with some balls removed 
   and moved. This way the opponent can finish the 
   game within 4 turns regardless of if they where 
   snookered or not.

   the game is over. If there is only one ball 
   left on the table the rest of the balls are

   placed anywhere at the top of the table behind 
   the line. The player must hit the 9 ball in one

   longer).

Chaos Seed - Fuusui Kairoki (c) 1996 Neverland 
Co., Ltd. / Taito Corporation 
 
In this action-strategy-RPG hybrid you play the 
role of a young member of a cave-dwelling race of 
warriors. As the planet is dying, it is your task 
to build the necessary mystic rooms in your caves 
to channel the energy back to the planet, but the 
surface-dwellers think that you are to blame for 
the current situation and constantly send waves of 
explorers and adventurers trying to clear your 
"dungeon". 
 
The game is played from a top-down perspective 
using a 2D engine in different phases, first you 
can roam your cave freely, molding the walls at 
your discretion by simply pushing and pulling into 
them to create the rooms needed to channel energy 
into the earth or create upgrades for your 
character, summon monsters to aid you, etc. When a 
timer runs out you proceed to a menu-based 
interface from which you control the energy 
production and decide what to upgrade, equip, etc. 
rinse and repeat for a new turn. Each turn brings 
new challenges in the form of surface-dwelling 
adventurers, which you must fight with your 
weapons and magic spells while attempting to build 
your rooms. 
 
Whenever you reach a certain quota of energy 
production you get to move on to another scenario 
in a different cave. As mentioned you can create 
summon rooms to invoke creatures that can aid you 
in combat, help you gather energy and other 
resources, etc. etc. 
 
Depending on how you place you rooms according to 
certain Feng-Shui principles you get bonuses and 
upgrades and you will also face cave-dwelling 
monsters that you must defeat and other NPCs that 
may or may not aid you.

faster and more action-oriented than earlier 
Choplifter games. 
 
Enemies appear in larger variety and numbers now. 
They reappear more often and some levels feature 
fights against large bosses. To compensate for 
this, there are more power-ups (such as missiles, 
bombs, invisibility, etc.) available, and it is 
possible to have the helicopter repaired at 
certain points in a level.

Choujikuu Yousai Macross - Scrambled Valkyrie (c) 
Oct 29, 1993 Winky Soft / Zamuse 
 
The legend of the Valkyrie pilots is not yet over. 
Hikaru, Max, and Millia take flight to defend the 
earth from Zentraedi, robots, more robots, and 
giant space crab-bees. Now is the time to scramble 
Valkyrie again. 
 
When starting a game or continuing the player 
picks from either Hikaru, Max, or Millia. Each 
flies a custom Valkyrie with its own set weapon 
load-out. A Valkyrie changes its weapon and 
movement speed by switching between its three 
forms: Fighter, Gerwalk, and Battroid. Typically 
the Valkyrie weapon shoots straight and quickly, 
the Gerwalk weapon shoots around or through 
obstacles, and the Battroid weapon does higher 
damage in exchange for reduced firing rate. Each 
weapon can be upgraded up to twice by picking up 
power up items dropped by special enemy ships, but 
one level of power up will be lost any time the 
Valkyrie is shot. If a Valkyrie's entire life bar 
is depleted then the full stage must be repeated, 
provided the player still has enough continues. 
 
In a nod to Galaga the player is able to capture 
some enemy craft to increase their firepower. If 
the player does not shoot any weapons for a few 
seconds a field of electricity will cover the 
Valkyrie. Touching some enemy ships will then 
cause their targeting to be shorted out and make 
them friendly to the player, following along and 
shooting or ramming onscreen enemies.

from the Cho Aniki series (yes the speedo wearing 
bodybuilders included) fight each other for 
ultimate supremacy using special attacks and 
moves. 
 
An interesting feature is that the game honors 
it's shooter roots, therefore instead of being 
restricted to walking backwards and forwards in 
the 2D plane and jumping around as in other 
fighting games, in this game all the characters 
can fly meaning the fights actually occur in 
mid-air allowing the players to dash all over the 
screen. Includes single player and 2-player vs 
modes.

Chou Mahou Tairiku WOZZ (c) Aug 04, 1995 Red 
Company Corporation / Bullet-Proof Software, Inc. 
 
The magic world of Wozz, populated by magicians, 
alchemists, and other kinds of people - including 
simple town and village inhabitants - was a 
seemingly peaceful place, until one day, a 
poisonous rain started turning its inhabitants 
into monsters. The chief wizard realizes that the 
demon Balaam is trying to link the world of Wozz 
with the world of humans. Only a human hero can 
stop Balaam, and the wizard's teleporting magic 
brings... three young humans: the Japanese girl 
Reona Kitazato, and two boys: the American Shot 
Phoenix and the Chinese Chun Chingtao. Will those 
youngsters be able to stop Balaam? 
 
The game is a traditional console-style RPG 
similar to Breath of Fire: turn-based battles are 
viewed from an isometric perspective. You control 
all three characters as a party, but in the 
beginning of the game you choose one of them as 
the main character, and therefore will see the 
game from his/her perspective. In case the 
characters split up, you'll be able to control 
only the one you chose.

Chrono Trigger (c) Aug 11, 1995 Square Co., Ltd. / 
Square Soft, Inc. 
 
What begins as a carefree day at the Millennial 
Fair for a young man named Crono turns into his 
ultimate adventure. When Crono meets a young girl 
named Marle, little does he realize that this 
young girl, his best friend Lucca's invention, and 
a mysterious pendant will thrust him into the 
ultimate trip through time and space, encountering 
new friends, defeating the forces of evil, and 
encountering the one who would destroy the flow of 
time. 
 
Chrono Trigger is a role-playing game, with the 
usual game mechanics fare for such: the player 
takes control of a variably large party, 
developing the combat skills of its members and 
managing their equipment. As the characters grow 
in power, not only their ability scores increase, 
but they also learn new "Techs" - special powerful 
attacks and maneuvers which cost them "Magic 
Points" to use in battle. 
 
The game utilizes the ATB (active time battle) 
combat system from  Final Fantasy games - sort of 
a mix of turn-based and real-time combat -  adding 
to it combo attacks. Apart from normal Techs, it 
is possible to use Double and Triple Techniques - 
super-powerful attacks which involve two or three 
characters using their abilities at once. There 
are no random battles in the game, as all the 
enemies are visible on screen, and it's even 
possible to just pass by them entirely. 
 
The game allows you to face your ultimate 
adversary at different points of time, which leads 
to several different endings. There is also a New 
Game+ option, which allows you to carry over your 
powerful characters to a new game, and adds even 
more endings to the already existing ones.

Civilization has the widest scope of any strategy

You begin in the Stone Age, and complete the game 
in the XXIth century (unless your civilization 
gets destroyed earlier). Your eventual goal is to 
become the dominant civilization in the world, 
either by wiping out everybody else, or being the 
first to get a space ship to Alpha Centauri. 
 
As the nation's leader, you have many 
responsibilities. You have to build cities, and 
then micromanage them, constructing various 
buildings. Most of people in your cities will be 
working on the neighbouring lands to get food 
(without it, your city won't survive or grow), 
production (used to build military units and 
buildings) and trade (which can be exchanged for 
money, science (see below) or luxuries that make 
people happy. You decide how much trade you want 
to invest into each of these areas.) You have to 
make sure that your people are in a good mood

Cliffhanger (c) Oct, 1993 Malibu Interactive / 
Sony Imagesoft 
 
Standard side-scrolling fighter based off of the 
Stallone film of the same name. Sly must fight 
thugs and the elements as he tracks down suitcases 
of stolen cash dropped around the peaks of the 
Rockies. Combat follows the Final Fight standard, 
broken up by some mountain climbing and running 
(or 3-D snowboarding on the Sega CD) from 
avalanches. 
 
Enemies are the standard brawler crooks, 
occasionally carrying guns and knives the player 
can pick up. The game tends to follow a pattern of 
having you deal with a natural hazard (scaling a 
cliff, leaping over gaps), then locking the screen 
down for a fighting segment, nature again, 
fighting again, etc. The available fighting moves 
is limited, compared to other games of this type, 
and the ability to hit an enemy character is 
noticeably less accurate. 
 
The plot is identical to the film, with levels 
based off of, or inspired by, scenes in the movie. 
Animated cutscenes move the story along on the 
cartridge systems, while brief clips from the film 
play between levels on the Sega CD.

Columns (c) Aug 01, 1999 SEGA Enterprises Ltd. / 
Media Factory 
 
Columns is loosely derived from Tetris, as it 
involves arranging falling blocks in such a way as 
to clear them. However, in columns they are groups 
of 3 same-size but varying color blocks, which 
must be arranged into sequences of 3 or more, 
either horizontally, vertically or diagonally. 
Sequences of 4 or 5 count for double or triple 
points, and diagonal sequences score the most. The 
real trick is to set up 'combos' - where one line 
causes other blocks to drop so as to create other 
lines. 
 
As well as the normal game mode, there is also a 
'flash' mode, in which the aim is simply to remove 
a particular block from the base of the pre-formed 
pile of bricks. The difficulty of this can be 
determined by increasing the number of complete 
rows which are already in place.

kill him and use up one of his lives. To return to 
human form, Congo can collect a ruby or if he 
collects rubies while already human he can turn

Crayon Shin-chan - Arashi wo yobu Enji (c) Jul 30, 
1993 
 
Five-year-old Shinnosuke Nohara is the epitome of 
noisy children: loud and inappropriate, 
infuriating to his parents, and hilarious to 
onlookers. Shin-chan is always getting in trouble 
with his parents and saying bizarre or offensive 
things to everyone he meets. Every so often, 
though, he'll try to do what his mom wants him to, 
but more often than not, he'll misunderstand and 
simply confound his parents further. 
 
Arashi o Yobu Enji ("A Kindergartner Called 
Tempest") is one of many games based on the manga 
and anime created by Yoshito Usui. In four stages, 
each made up of five areas, Shin-chan must explore 
his neighborhood looking for a specific object. He 
can enter houses to ask people for information, 
but will often end up simply insulting them. He 
must also avoid or knock over the other children 
in the neighborhood, and has various ability cards 
that he can use to assist him, which might give 
him a water pistol or refill his health. After 
finding what he's looking for, Shin-chan will move 
on to the next area. 
 
Also included is a minigame mode with eight 
different minigames, such as a bubble-blowing 
contest, a three-legged race, and a desperate 
search for clothing before school. The entire 
game, including the minigames, is filled with 
dialogue containing the same humor as the source 
material.

There was once a prosperous kingdom, a peaceful 
kingdom, ruled by a wise old king, where all 
peopled lived happily together, protected by the 
power of a magical crystal. But one day, several 
dark clouds appeared over the kingdom and poured 
down a devastating rain. And then one of the 
clouds turned into a demon, and, reaching its 
hands to the treasure room in the palace, took the 
crystal away. The demon lord, still in a form of a 
menacing dark cloud, started spawning monsters and 
sending them to attack the now helpless kingdom. 
The king called to the heavens for help. Eight 
magical weapons fell on the ground, and eight 
warriors rose to protect their country. Your task 
now is to cleanse the land of the monsters and to 
defeat the evil demon lord. 
 
"Crystal Beans" is an action RPG based on fighting 
and dungeon crawling. You can play as either of 
the eight initial character classes: Fighter, 
Warrior, Bow-man, Wizard, Priest, Kage (a kind of 
a ninja), Monk, or Witch. In addition, there are 
four secret classes you discover during your 
journey. Each class has its own strength and 
weaknesses, and two unique attack types.

Cybernator (c) 1993 NCS Corporation / Konami, Inc. 
 
In a future where fossil fuels are limited, major 
countries and forces of the world are at war with 
one another over territory. Alliances are made, 
forming two major sides: The Axis and The 
Federation.  The elite units in these wars are 
Assault Suits, man-piloted combat mechs called 
Assault Suits.  Jake is one such pilot, drafted 
into the Pacific States' Marine Corp under the 
Federation. During his training, the war has grown 
substantially and upon being assigned to a 
platoon, he is immediately thrown into combat. 
 
Cybernator is a side scrolling mech combat game 
and platform game. The player controls Jake as he 
moves his assault suit left and right on the 
battlefield. The assault suit can jump and use a 
jetpack for a short time to increase altitude. The 
assault suit begins with a Shot machine gun weapon 
that spreads out fire in front, and a Punch weapon 
for close melee. Additional weapons can be found 
during the course of the game and existing weapons 
improved by the gathering of "P" power-ups, left 
by defeated enemy. Each level contains a variety 
of enemies and an end boss which must be destroyed 
to reach the next level. Some levels take place as 
horizontally scrolling shooters, in which the 
Assault suit can move up, down, left and right on 
the screen... but is constantly advancing towards 
new threats.

Cyber Knight (c) Oct 30, 1992 Advance 
Communication Company / Tonkinhouse 
 
In the 24th century, mankind has gone into space. 
The crew of the starship Swordfish are in an 
engagement with space pirates when the battle 
takes a turn for the worse. In desperation, the 
crew activate their jump drive without a 
destination... and end up flung across the galaxy 
to the galactic core. The Swordfish however is 
badly damaged with many casualties including the 
captain. Only 26 of the crew survive, and of them 
only 6 are qualified for combat: The commander, 
two soldiers, a mechanic and a doctor and six 
giant "Module" mechanized suits available for 
them. These survivors locate planet Farworld, 
apparently colonized by humans. There they 
discover the colony is under attack by a 
relentless mechanical aliens dubbed "Berserkers". 
The crew of the swordfish must fight back against 
the Berserkers and explore the galaxy for some 
means to return home. 
 
Cyber Knight is an RPG with a science-fiction 
theme of being lost in an alien galaxy. The game 
takes place in a top-down view for movement on 
planets and areas, a side-view for combat 
sequences and a first person menu system when 
aboard the Swordfish starship. The Swordfish can 
travel between stars, scanning worlds for 
information. If the ship is able to land on a 
planet, three crew members piloting three Modules 
(giant robots) can be selected to debark and 
explore the planet. Many planets will have towns 
or people living on them which can be talked to in 
order to uncover information. Different quests are 
assigned in order to find the items necessary to 
progress. There is no system of currency or buying 
items. Instead, many defeated Berserkers leave 
behind "NeoParts", which can be brought back to 
the Swordfish's lab. Analysis of these Neo parts 
unlocks enhances statistics (endurance, agility, 
accuracy, etc) for the Modules and new weapons for 
them to carry. The six modules are unique in 
statistics, and also the six pilots each carry 
different skills. 
 
Combat takes place in turn-based combat on a 6x6 
squares field. Seen from the side view, the three 
modules can be positioned in relation to enemies 
in order to attack, using a variety of melee and 
long-ranged weaponry. Ammunition is unlimited, but 
each module also carries a number of "options" 
that are consumable attacks. Each Module has two 
sets of hitpoints: one for the pilot and one for 
the module itself. If either one of these reaches 
zero, the module is destroyed. In order to heal, 
the party carries 10 each of repair kits and first 
aid kits, which must when not in combat. These 
kits, as well as options and defeated pilots or 
modules can be restored by returning to the 
Swordfish.

Following the events of the first Cyber Knight in 
the 24th century, the crew of the Swordfish have 
returned to Earth after defeating the mechanical 
"Berzerkers" far across space. However during 
their time away, the Earth Federation has been 
taken over by the ambitious General Forrest, who 
seeks to wage war on the independent systems and 
conquer them. Recognizing the potential weapons 
that could be made from the Berzerker science 
data, Forrest impounds the Swordfish and jails 
it's crew. The Berzerker data is used to create 
"Overtech" and bring to life "Metalliforms", 
self-replicating war machines. The Swordfish crew 
manages to escape, thanks to a mysterious agent 
"CJ", and are recruited into the resistance 
against the Earth Federation. Given a new 
spaceship, the Galvodirge, they must travel the 
galaxy to different human civilizations and devise 
a plan to stop Earth's attack. 
 
Cyber Knight II is an RPG with science-fiction 
themes. As in the first game, much of the game 
takes place in a top-down view for movement on 
planets and areas, a side-view for combat 
sequences and a first person menu system when 
aboard the Galvodirge starship. The Galvodirge can 
travel between stars, scanning worlds for 
information. If the ship is able to land on a 
planet, the crew can debark either on foot or 
using combat modules (mechs). Some areas are only 
accessible using modules and others (such as 
towns) do not allow the use of these war machines. 
Many planets will have towns or people living on 
them which can be talked to in order to uncover 
information. Different quests are assigned in 
order to find the items necessary to progress. 
There is no system of currency or buying items. 
Instead, many defeated enemies leave behind 
"NeoParts", which can be brought back to the 
Swordfish's lab. Analysis of these Neo parts 
unlocks enhances statistics (endurance, agility, 
accuracy, etc) for the Modules and new weapons for 
them to carry. 
 
The crew are divided into a three person "combat 
team" and a three person "support team". If 
modules are used, they can be assigned from the 
ship's hanger. Unlike the first game, modules only 
perform a combat or a support role, and each is 
unique in statistics and the type of weaponry it 
can carry. When combat occurs on the main map, the 
support team will often deliver the first strike 
by firing missiles into the enemies. When 
searching facilities, caves or other locations, 
the support team is not available. Following 
either case, the combat team engages the enemy in 
turn-based combat on a 6x6 squares field. Seen 
from the side view, the three modules can be 
positioned in relation to enemies in order to 
attack, using a variety of melee and long-ranged 
weaponry. Ammunition is unlimited, but each module 
also carries a number of "options" that are 
consumable attacks. Each Module has two sets of 
hitpoints: one for the pilot and one for the

Daikaijuu Monogatari (c) Dec 22, 1994 Birthday / 
Hudson Soft Company, Ltd. 
 
The magical land of Shelldorado is populated by 
creatures who look like beasts, but possess a 
great wisdom despite their appearance. A long time 
ago, the land was attacked by the Demon King 
Fattobajah. The Demon King was only defeated by 
the power of the four great elemental shells - 
Fire Shell, Water Shell, Air Shell, and Earth 
Shell. In the ultimate battle, Fattobajah was 
sealed by the magical Aura Balls, and the Balls 
themselves were sealed in a crypt in Dorado City, 
so that the Demon King could never reawaken. 
 
Years have passed, and a disaster occurred. 
Several meteors  fell to earth, causing huge tidal 
waves. The Shell-beasts realize it must be another 
Aura Ball, one they have not sealed. They call the 
Hero of the Fire Shell back to Shelldorado. He 
must seal the new Aura Ball, but he can do that 
only after finding the other Shell heroes. The 
Hero of the Fire Shell is you... 
 
The game is a traditional console-style RPG with 
random battles and turn-based combat, viewed from 
semi-third-person "over-the-shoulder" perspective. 
There are a lot of party members to recruit, the 
Shell heroes as well as optional, secret 
characters. The party members you find might have 
a unique skill which can be required to solve 
puzzles. At one point in the game, you'll also be 
able to build your own town.

Enix Corporation 
 
Through the Light came the Darkness, and through 
the Darkness came the Light. They were inseparable 
in the beginning, and gave birth to each other. 
Rukyu appeared before all the other creatures, the 
great demon of darkness, later to be known as the 
Satan. The divine hero-god Roda went up to his 
dark realm to defeat him, but was struck down, and 
presumed dead. But the hero couldn't die so 
easily: he swore to defeat Rukyu once and for all. 
Meanwhile, Rukyu doesn't just stay in his realm, 
waiting for Roda: he goes out to the world as a 
death-bringing sorcerer, and he is out for Roda... 
 
The game is quite different from most other RPGs, 
because it lets you play as both the "good" hero 
and the villain. The game is divided into 
chapters, and each chapter is played by either 
Roda or Rukyu. You switch the two heroes 
chapter-after-chapter, and lead them to their 
ultimate battle from two opposite sides. The 
entire game, including the battles, is viewed from 
an isometric perspective. The battles are random 
and turn-based, and the battle field is divided 
into squares you can position and move your 
characters on. Both Roda and Rukyu can have party 
members join them, and both attack mostly with 
magic. Rukyu uses a special energy called "Soul 
Power", while Roda cast one-time spells from 
scrolls he receives after battles.

Dark Law - Meaning of Death (c) Mar 28, 1997 ASCII 
Corporation / ASCII Corporation 
 
Three-hundred years ago, there were two kingdoms 
on the earth -Reyfore, ruled by the benevolent and 
mighty king Reynard, and Amugnon, ruled by king 
Daruk. The two kingdoms could have lived in peace, 
but pride took over king Daruk, he didn't respect 
the Goddess any more, and as a result his mind 
became obsessed by the idea of destruction. Daruk 
attacked Reyfore, and for decades war was 
embracing the two kingdoms, setting the Earth in 
flames. After a prolonged battle, king Reynard 
defeated king Daruk, and a reign of prosperity 
began once again. 
 
But can evil be truly defeated? The hero of the 
game, a young adventurer, falls down from a cliff 
while taking a stroll near the ancient Sophia 
Temple. He is saved by an old man who lives with 
his daughter Refia in a small country house. But 
one day, a demonic-looking knight appears, 
accompanied by monsters, kills the old man, and 
kidnaps Refia. The old man recognized the knight - 
it was king Daruk! Now the hero must bring Refia 
back and defeat Daruk once and for all. 
 
The game has a less linear structure than a 
standard console-style RPG: together with the main 
story there are many missions, or "scenarios", 
which are not obligatory to complete, but which 
occupy a large portion of the game. In the 
beginning of the game you create a party of four 
characters, the hero and his three companions. The 
battles are pre-determined and take place on the 
same screen as the gameworld itself. Your party 
and the enemies can move freely around the screen 
and attack with melee and ranged weapons, and 
their actions depend on the amount of action 
points they have. Navigation in town is 
menu-based.

Demolition Man is a game based on the 1993 movie 
by the same name. As with the movie, the game 
takes place in a dystopian Los Angeles, in 1996. 
John Spartan is the country´s most fearsome cop 
and hunts his nemesis, Simon Phoenix. However in 
doing so, he kills several innocent civilians and 
both characters are sentenced to cryostasis 
rehabilitation where they will be brainwashed for 
30 years. However the brainwashing does not go as 
planned and upon waking up, Phoenix goes on a new 
crime spree. However in 30 years the world has 
also changed and Los Angeles has become San 
Angeles, a utopian and violence-free society. As a 
remnant of a more violent past, police officer 
John Spartan is once again sent to capture 
Phoenix. 
 
Demolition Man is a fast-paced platform game, with 
some levels taking place in an overhead 
perspective (similar to Smash TV). As John 
Spartan, the player will spend most of his time 
shooting endless waves of "cryocons" released upon 
the antiseptic world of the future. The standard 
weapon can be upgraded with a shotgun and magnum, 
both with limited ammo. Additionally, various 
types of grenades can be collected, which are 
thrown independently of the firearm. Simon Phoenix 
appears as a boss character at the end of every 
level that is directly tied in with the movie. 
 
The Sega CD version of the game retains identical 
levels and gameplay, but adds digitized clips from 
the film to introduce levels and advance the plot.

Demon's Crest is a sequel to Gargoyle's Quest. 
Once, the world of demons and the world of humans 
co-existed in harmony. But then six mysterious 
crests fell from the sky onto the earth, crests of 
six elements: fire, water, air, earth, time, and 
heaven. The demons became obsessed with the crests 
and with the power hidden in them, and so a civil 
war started. Finally, the Red Demon named 
Firebrand got all the crests but one - the crest 
of heaven. The Dragon Demon possessed this crest, 
so Firebrand decided to confront him. He defeated 
the Dragon Demon, but was himself severely wounded 
in battle. While flying back, he was knocked down 
by a mysterious enemy and lost his crests. 
 
You control Firebrand, a flying red demon, and 
your mission is to help him to gain his crests, 
and to defeat everybody who stands in his way. 
This is a platform action game: you fight the 
enemies in real time (using magical attacks), 
avoid obstacles, collect healing potions on the 
way, etc. Firebrand can also fly for a short time.

can usually be avoided. The enemies regenerate as 
you move on, although you generally only progress 
from bottom-left to top-right anyway. 
 
Some of the holes in the ground are deadly while 
others lead to secret rooms. Fortunately, you are 
given up to 9 lives at the start, and lots of 
extra lives are on offer throughout the game, so 
these are well worth checking out. A choice 
between music and sound effects is offered.

Der Langrisser (c) Jun 30, 1995 Crosstalk Inc.|NCS 
Corporation / Masaya 
 
"Der Langrisser" is a sequel to the game that was 
known outside of Japan as  Warsong, and is in fact 
a remake of the Genesis game  Langrisser II. 
 
The Blue Dragon Knights of the Rayguard Empire are 
trying to steal the virtuous sorceress Riana. 
Their goal is to make her serve the evil Emperor 
Bozel, whose intention is to find the most 
powerful evil sword in the land, the Alhazard. 
Naturally, the main hero of the game, the knight 
Elwin, has not only to rescue Riana, but to 
retrieve the legendary holy sword Langrisser, the 
only artifact that is more powerful than Alhazard. 
At first, Elwin automatically follows the "good" 
path, but as the game progresses, he can choose 
whether to continue being good, to become an ally 
with Rayguard, or to side with the forces of Chaos 
whose goal is utter destruction. 
 
"Der Langrisser" features a complex character 
creation process, during which you must answer 
morally ambiguous questions,  Ultima-style, that 
will determine the class and the attributes of the 
main hero. The game is a strategy RPG in which you 
control your party only during battles. You just 
hire soldiers and unite them under commands of 
generals. When your units attack the enemy, an 
automatic battle sequence occurs. You can also use 
magic spells to heal your troops or to harm enemy 
soldiers.

Although this soccer game is based on Goal, it 
features a very different control method, with the 
ball on sticking to your foot to make running with 
the ball easier. The game is viewed from above and 
played up and down the pitch, without the 
left-to-right option of Goal. Matches can be 
between 2 or 20 minutes, and the scanner which 
shows player positions on the rest of the pitch 
can be moved, resized or disabled. The method of 
triggering aftertouch onto a pass can be chosen as 
well. 
 
The game features a variety of tournaments, 
including the full World Cup and its qualifying 
rounds, and the European Championships, or 
individual matches, as well as being able to 
configure a league or cup tournament ot your own 
specification. Only international teams are 
included, although their names can be customised. 
Unlike most soccer games of the time, player 
ethnicities are accurately depicted.

Dirt Trax Fx is a Motocross racing game in which 
players can choose between 8 drivers, differing in 
top speed, acceleration, turning and braking, to 
compete on 22 different tracks. The tracks feature 
lots of mounds, ramps, pits and other similar 
obstacles. Parts of a track might also be covered 
in water mud or ice. To successfully navigate the 
motorbike through these obstacles, the shoulder 
buttons can be used to lean the bike, while 
pressing up or down changes the angle of the bike. 
Before the game begins, players can choose between 
four different bikes ranging from 50cc to 500cc 
(the last bike needs to be unlocked first). The 
choice of the bike greatly affects the game's 
speed as well as the overall difficulty. 
 
Apart from the main race, there is also a "Rad 
Tag" mode. In this mode, a timer ticks down that 
can only be stopped by hitting the opponent. The 
driver whose timer reaches zero first loses.

$info=DOOM,
$<a href="http://www.mobygames.com/game/snes/doom"</a>

DOOM (c) Feb 29, 1996 id Software, Inc. / Williams 
Entertainment Inc. 
 
The Union Aerospace Corporation has been 
experimenting with teleportation technology on 
Mars' moons Phobos and Deimos. After early 
successes, something goes wrong. It seems the 
scientists have opened a gateway straight to Hell. 
Phobos base is overrun with demonic creatures, and 
the whole of Deimos simply vanishes. A squad of 
marines is sent to Phobos, but all except one are 
quickly slaughtered. It falls to the surviving 
marine to grab some guns and strike back at the 
demons. 
 
id Software's follow-up to their genre-defining 
Wolfenstein 3D, DOOM is another first person 
shooter: full-on action seen from the space 
marine's perspective. Like Wolfenstein, the game 
consists of distinct episodes, playable in any 
order. The first episode, Knee-Deep in the Dead, 
takes place in the Phobos base and is freely 
available as shareware. The full game continues on 
Deimos in The Shores of Hell and culminates in 
Inferno, the final episode which takes place in 
Hell itself. Each episode consists of nine levels, 
one of which is a hidden level. 
 
The basic objective in each level is simply to 
reach the exit. Since dozens of enemies stand in 
the way, the only way to get there is through 
killing them. Switches and buttons must be 
pressed to advance at certain points and often 
color-coded locked doors will block the way - 
matching keycards or skull keys must be found to 
pass. 
 
DOOM's engine technology is more advanced than 
Wolfenstein's, and thus the levels are more varied 
and complex. The engine simulates different 
heights (stairs and lifts appear frequently) and 
different lighting conditions (some rooms are 
pitch black, others only barely illuminated). 
There are outdoor areas, pools of radioactive 
waste that hurt the player, ceilings that come 
down and crush him, and unlike Wolfenstein's 
orthogonally aligned corridors, the walls in DOOM 
can be in any angle to each other. An automap 
helps in navigating the levels. 
 
Stylistically, the levels begin with a futuristic 
theme in the military base on Phobos and gradually 
change to a hellish environment, complete with 
satanic symbols (pentagrams, upside-down-crosses 
and portraits of horned demons), hung-up mutilated 
corpses and the distorted faces of the damned. 
 
DOOM features a large weapon arsenal, with most 
weapons having both advantages and drawbacks. The 
starting weapons are the fists and a simple 
pistol. Also available are a shotgun (high damage, 
slow reload, not good at distances), a chaingun 
(high firing rate, but slightly inaccurate in 
longer bursts) and a plasma rifle (combining a 
high firing rate and large damage). The rocket 
launcher also deals out lots of damage, but the 
explosion causes blast damage and must be used 
with care in confined areas or it might prove 
deadly to the player as well as the enemies. Two 
further (in)famous weapons in DOOM are the 
chainsaw for close-quarter carnage, and the 
BFG9000 energy gun, that, while taking some 
practice to fire correctly, can destroy most 
enemies in a single burst. The different weapons 
use four different ammunition types (bullets, 
shells, rockets and energy cells), so collecting 
the right type for a certain gun is important. 
 
DOOM drops some of Wolfenstein's arcade-inspired 
aspects, so there are no extra lives or treasures 
to be collected for points, but many other 
powerups are still available. Medpacks heal damage 
while armor protects from receiving it in the 
first place. Backpacks allow more ammunition to be 
carried, a computer map reveals the whole layout 
of the level on the automap (including any secret 
areas), light amplification visors illuminate dark 
areas and radiation suits allow travel over waste 
without taking damage. Also available are berserk 
packs (which radically increase the damage 
inflicted by the fists) as well as short-time 
invisibility and invulnerability powerups. 
 
The enemies to be destroyed include former humans 
corrupted during the invasion, plus demons in all 
shapes and sizes: fireball-throwing imps, floating 
skulls, pink-skinned demons with powerful bite 
attacks and large one-eyed flying monstrosities 
called Cacodemons. Each episode ends with a boss 
battle against one or two especially powerful 
creatures. 
 
DOOM popularized multiplayer in the genre with two 
different modes: Cooperative allows up to four 
players to move through the single-player game 
together, while Deathmatch is a competitive game 
type where players blast at each other to collect 
'frag' points for a kill and re-spawn in 
a random location after being killed.

Each character has the ability to punch, kick, 
jump and unleash a special move (usually by being

punch). The better the skill in fighting, the more 
ability points are earned. These ability points

The game is closely related to Doraemon: Nobita to 
Yosei no Kuni. It is based on the manga 
"Doraemon", that tells the story of a Japanese boy 
named Nobita, who always gets bullied by stronger 
kids in the school. In the future, his grandson 
uses a time machine and send the cat-like robot 
Doraemon to protect Nobita. In this adventure, 
Nobita, Doraemon, and their friends travel to the 
Toys Land. Some evil toys are threatening this 
country, and it's up to our heroes to help its 
inhabitants. 
 
The game is divided into adventure and platform 
action modes. In adventure mode, Doraemon walks 
around towns, talking to people and entering 
houses. Key locations lead to platform levels, 
which must be completed to advance the story. 
Platform levels include plenty of obstacles (pits, 
spikes, self-destructing platforms etc.), as well 
as various enemies who try to stop the heroes. You 
can choose one of the six available characters to 
play through the platform level. They all can jump 
and defeat enemies either by jumping on their 
heads or by using long-ranged weapons.

Doraemon. It tells the story of a Japanese boy 
named Nobita, who often gets beaten by other boys. 
Nobita's future grandson constructs a cat-like 
blue robot named Doraemon, and sends him to the 
past to protect Nobita. In this game, a friend of 
Nobita's finds a fossil. Accidentally, this fossil 
gets overrun by a car. Nobita feels it was his 
fault and asks Doraemon to use a time machine to

fossil. 
 
This is an action platform game with adventure 
elements. You can control Doraemon, Nobita, and 
other characters, traveling through platform

Dossun! Ganseki Battle (c) 1994 I'Max Corp. / 
I'Max Corp. 
 
A falling block puzzle game  in a pseudo-medieval 
fantasy setting that pits two characters against 
each other in an abstract form of combat that is 
quite similar to games like Columns. Combining at 
least three matching symbols in a vertical, 
horizontal or diagonal line does not only clear 
them off the screen, but also deals damage to an 
opponent. This means that players do not only have 
to keep their game area clear, but also pay 
attention to their characters health bar. Once a 
block touches the top of the screen or the health 
bar is diminished the game ends. 
 
There are four different icons that have different 
effects when combined: 
Books, swords and rocks deal damage to an opponent 
by attacking with fireballs, dragons or swords. 
Bottles heal a certain amount of health. 
Purple blocks have no effect, but clog up the 
screen nonetheless. 
 
Chain reactions result in particularly powerful 
attacks or place one or more grey blocks inside 
the opponents area. They can be destroyed just 
like ordinary blocks, but they always stay in the 
same spot and do not fall down. 
 
More complex chain reactions give access to 
special attacks, up to three of which can be held 
and activated with the shoulder buttons. Special 
attacks have different effects that include 
clearing all purple blocks, using all potions and 
clearing the bottom three lines.

Doukyuusei 2 (c) Dec 01, 1997 Elf Co., Ltd. / 
Banpresto Co., Ltd. 
 
Dokyusei is a classic "love adventure", a genre 
that is also referred to (quite erroneously) as 
"dating simulations". You are a high-school 
student, whose father is a famous archaeologist 
traveling around the world, and whose mother died 
when he was a child. It is now your third year at 
the 88 High School, and naturally, your primary 
concern is your love life. Will you be able to 
date successfully and to come to a happy ending 
with one of the fifteen lovely female classmates? 
 
The game mechanics are a lot like in a "standard" 
adventure game (examine objects, visit various 
locations, talk to people, make decisions), but 
the plot centers exclusively around your 
relationship with the girls. The game has its own 
internal clock. You can move around your character 
on a "city map", visiting different locations. 
Every visit takes 20-30 minutes of game time. You 
can make appointments and visit various places at 
a specific time. The decisions you make influence 
the story.

Downtown Nekketsu Baseball Monogatari - Baseball

Japan Corp. / Technos Japan Corp. 
 
Another sports title in the Nekketsu High game 
series, this time featuring the Nekketsu guys go 
at each other's throat while playing baseball. 
 
The game features a single play, Vs and 
Tournament/story mode. The gameplay itself  is 
similar to other baseball games in the sense that 
it subdivides the different stages of baseball 
(batting, pitching, running bases, etc.) in 
different "mini games" with their own camera 
angles and interfaces. 
 
As expected of a Nekketsu game you can play it 
rough by sneaking punches and kicks to "bend" the 
rules a bit, you can also use the "ki" or 
willpower of your players to trigger special moves 
and strategic management is limited to specifying 
different base strategies and behaviors for each 
player.

Do-Re-Mi Fantasy - Milon no Dokidoki Daibouken 
   (c) Mar 22, 1996 Hudson Soft Company, Ltd. / 
   Hudson Soft Company, Ltd. 
 
A young boy named Milon sets off to save Alis, his 
fairy friend, after she was captured by the evil 
sorcerer Amon. He later learns that the only way 
to defeat Amon is by collecting five legendary 
instruments which Amon has stolen.  The sorcerer 
placed a curse on these instruments so that their 
true powers cannot be used and then left them in 
the hands of his minions.  The only way to lift 
the curse is by collecting five stars. 
 
Armed with only his bubble shooter, Milon must 
retrieve the legendary instruments, lift their 
curses and use their powers to defeat Amon and 
rescue Alis. 
 
Traveling through many different worlds starting 
with the forest, Milon will be confronted by many 
enemies. Milon can either shoot bubbles to trap 
and send his enemies away, or he can jump and 
flatten his enemies temporarily turning them into 
a platform for him to walk across. 
 
Milon has three different "outfits": red, blue, 
and green.  With the green outfit, Milon can 
withstand three hits.  Each time he gets hit, he 
will be downgraded a color - green to blue, blue 
to red.  If he gets hit with the red outfit, he 
will die and have to start the level over. 
 
By collecting 100 music notes, Milon will get an 
extra life.  There are also other useful items to 
get like bubble gum that will save Milon once if 
he were to fall, a special bubble shooter that 
let's him shoot multiple bubbles at once and a 
star that makes Milon temporarily invincible so 
that he can defeat enemies simply by running at 
them.

Dragon Ball Z - Super Butouden (c) Mar 20, 1993 
Tose Co., Ltd. / Bandai Co., Ltd. 
 
Dragon Ball Z: Super Butouden was the first 
fighting game based on the Dragon Ball Z franchise 
and the first to introduce the split-screen mode 
to the games, where the screen is split in two 
whenever one of the two combatants moves away too 
far to keep them both shown in a single screen. 
This title features the adventures of Goku from 
the battle against Piccolo in the martial arts 
tournament to the conclusion of the Cell Games. 
 
The initially available characters are Goku 
(without SSJ), Vegeta (without SSJ), C-20, C-16, 
Piccolo, Freezer, C-18 and Original Cell. But upon 
entering the right code you can expand the list 
with Future Trunks (SSJ), Gohan (SSJ), Perfect 
Cell, Goku (SSJ), and Vegeta (SSJ), all of them 
relegated to occasionally appear in the Story Mode 
either as rivals or as alternative selectable 
characters. 
 
In the story mode, players select which fighter to 
pit against each opponent as while advancing 
rounds leading up to the battle against Perfect 
Cell. Players can also go one-on-one against 
another player or a CPU opponent. There is also a 
martial arts tournament mode, to play against 
eight players or CPU opponents in a elimination 
tournament.

Tose Co., Ltd. / Bandai Co., Ltd. 
 
Dragon Ball Z: Super Butouden 2 is a fighting game 
that chronicles the events that take place during 
the battle against Perfect Cell, and includes a 
side story about Bojack and his henchmen (who 
Gohan, Trunks, Piccolo and Vegita fought in the 
"Bojack Unbound" movie), and Broli, the Legendary 
Super Saiyan. You can play as SSJ2 Gohan, Piccolo, 
Vegeta, Future Trunks, Perfect Cell, Cell Jr., 
Bojack or Zangya. Goku and Broli will be also 
available after you enter a secret code. 
 
Some basic elements from Super Butouden have 
remained, such as the split screen system or the 
special attacks (which now are executed by a 
shorter button combination). However, now you will 
also count with the Meteo combos, which allow 
attacks with multiple hits. You can also hold down 
buttons in order to quickly recharge your energy. 
Special moves can be also fired back in 
retaliation to your rival's attack, marking then 
the beginning of a button smashing duel. 
 
There are 3 game modes, including a story mode 
that lets you choose different paths and changes 
depending on the outcome of battles

Dragon Ball Z - Super Butouden 3 (c) Sep 29, 1994 
Tose Co., Ltd. / Bandai Co., Ltd. 
 
Dragon Ball Z: Super Butouden 3 (known as Dragon 
Ball Z: Ultime Menace in France) is the last 
installment to the Super Butoden series for the 
SNES, which in this occasion is based on the Majin 
Buu saga. Avaliable charachers are Goku, Goten, 
Kid Trunks, Majin Vegita, Junior Gohan, Kaiohshin, 
Majin Boo, Darbura and C-18, plus another one 
available as a secret character: Future Trunks. 
 
Split screen mode is maintained, but now you can 
now fly up or down while on the same screen as 
your opponent. You can also struggle with your 
rival pushing with your arms together to test your 
button smashing abilities, or execute new Meteor 
Combos. Scenarios will also be different (mainly 
based on Buu saga) and will include alternative 
versions of themselves with different times of the 
day as well. 
 
The game allows you to take part either in a 8 
player martial arts tournament with an eliminatory 
system or to make single combats against the CPU 
or another player. This makes Super Butouden 3 the 
only game of the series without a Story Mode,. It 
can be explained by the fact that when the game 
was released the Buu saga was still on a very 
early stage in Japanese TV.

Dragon Ball Z - Super Gokuuden Kakusei Hen (c) Sep 
22, 1995 Bandai Co., Ltd. / Bandai Co., Ltd. 
 
This is a direct sequel to the  first "interactive 
fighter" for SNES, based on the popular 
manga/animé series Dragon Ball. The game picks up 
the story where it ended in the previous game, and 
continues through Piccolo, Saiyajin, and Freezer 
sagas of the manga. After the battle with the 
Demon King (Daimaou) Piccolo, the twenty-third 
World Martial Arts Tournament is about to begin. 
But to the amazement of the hero Son Goku and his 
friends, their archrival Piccolo appears during 
the tournament, so that it quickly turns into a 
genuine battle. 
 
You control Son Goku and his son Son Gohan, 
switching between them as the game progresses. The 
game is basically an interactive comic book in 
which you can influence the story by choosing to 
press a button when the game prompts you to make a 
choice. You'll also participate in battles. The 
battle system is similar to rock-paper-scissors 
game, where one kind of move always beats or 
always loses to another. You can dash into your 
enemies, attack physically, and perform special 
moves, pressing the buttons in real time (although 
the battles are divided into turns).

Dragon Ball Z - Super Gokuuden Totsugeki Hen (c) 
Mar 24, 1995 Bandai Co., Ltd. / Bandai Co., Ltd. 
 
The first of the two "interactive fighters" for 
SNES based on the famous manga series Dragon Ball. 
"Totsugeki Hen" tells the story of the hero, Son 
Goku, following the first volume of the manga. The 
boy Son Goku meets a mysterious girl named Bulma, 
and she sends him on a mission to obtain the 
magical Dragon Balls. Naturally, Bulma is not the 
only one needing those Balls, so that the young 
hero will soon have to face and defeat some bad 
guys, including his first true rival Piccolo. 
 
The game puts you in control of Son Goku only 
during battles or when there is a possibility to 
make a choice and to influence the storyline. 
There is no other gameplay in the game except 
fighting and picking answers from menu. The fights 
are one-on-one: you pause them by pressing the 
start button, and then program Son Goku, making 
him execute various moves: dash, kick, special 
attack, etc. Every attack can be countered by an 
enemy attack, and you have to follow the enemy's 
move pattern in order to attack and defend 
successfully.

Dragon Ball Z - Super Saiya Densetsu (c) Jan 25, 
1992 Bandai Co., Ltd. / Bandai Co., Ltd. 
 
Cho Saiya Densetsu is based on the popular 
manga/animé series Dragon Ball. It follows the 
events described in the beginning of Dragon Ball 
Z, the second story block, which tells about the 
connection of the hero Son Goku with a powerful 
alien race, and new mighty foes from far away 
planets. The game starts just where the tale of 
Dragon Ball begins. Son Goku goes to meet his 
friends, but is stopped by a mysterious stranger 
named Raditz who tells Son Goku they are 
relatives. Raditz demands from him to destroy 
humanity, and as Son Goku refuses, takes his son 
Son Gohan hostage. To rescue his son, Son Goku 
joins forces with his arch-rival, the Demon King 
Piccolo, who obviously has his own plans 
concerning Raditz. And thus begins the story 
during which Son Goku will learn of his true 
origin... 
 
The game is a RPG similar to the card-based Dragon 
Ball Z RPGs for NES. During battles, you choose 
cards from your card inventory, which determine 
the nature and the strength of your characters' 
attacks. You can also train your characters in 
training houses and upgrade their special Ki 
power. Unlike early DBZ RPGs, you can move around 
freely in Cho Saiya Densetsu, and your movements 
are not determined by cards. You can also fly 
around the world and use your special Dragon Radar 
to discover location of magical Dragon Balls.

wizard Lushifon wants to turn all people into 
stones, and to control the whole world without 
being disturbed by them. Together with the 
mysterious swordsman Eto, and many other heroes, 
Kakeru must perform his ultimate quest and to 
defeat Lushifon and his minions. 
 
This is a strategy RPG: during battles, you

range, strengths, and weaknesses. There are many 
characters you can recruit to your party, and they 
belong to different classes (barbarians, archers, 
magicians, etc.).

continue your father's brave deeds and to defeat 
Baramos.

This is a remake of two classic NES RPGs - an 
exclusively Japanese release of the two first 
Dragon Quest titles on one cartridge. 
 
In Dragon Quest (known as Dragon Warrior in the 
US), you play as the descendant of the legendary 
warrior Erdrick, and your goal is to recover the 
magical Ball of Light from Erdrick's and the 
humanity's arch-enemy, the Dragon Lord. In Dragon 
Quest II, you assume the role of the descendant of 
the hero of the first game, and must join forces 
with two other characters in order to defeat a 
demon lord who destroyed a nearby city and killed 
its inhabitants. 
 
Both RPGs feature random battles and turn-based 
combat viewed from first-person perspective. In 
Dragon Quest you fight alone, while in the sequel 
two other characters can join your party, and you 
also fight against multiple enemies at once. 
 
The remake includes updated graphics (although 
they still retain the original NES look), sound of 
SNES quality, and some changes in the gameplay and 
in the game world. Certain locations are larger, 
some menu commands (such as "Stairs") are omitted, 
and there is a larger variety of items.

But soon the hero will discover his dream was not

"Dragon Quest VI" is the last SNES game of the

battles viewed from 1st person perspective. Not 
much has changed since the NES days of Dragon 
Quest - gameplay style, setting, and even menu 
layout seem almost identical to those of the early 
classics. Like its immediate predecessor  Dragon

You are the son of the brave warrior, Lord Papas. 
It appears that your mother died just after giving 
birth to you, and your father took you on a long 
journey when you were a little baby, and all you 
know is that he was searching for something. Now 
you are six years old, and Lord Papas brings you 
to your home village. After some time, you learn 
that His Highness Prince Henry was kidnapped by 
bandits. Your father attempts to rescue him, and 
during this action you discover that perhaps your 
mother is still alive... The game follows the 
story of Papas' son, and this story is stretched 
over years, as the hero grows and becomes a man of 
courage and virtue. During the game, the hero will 
discover the truth about his mother, and will have 
to make some crucial decisions, such as which girl 
to marry (the decisions affect the course of the 
game and its ending). 
 
"Dragon Quest V" is a party RPG with turn-based 
combat, and battles viewed from 1st person 
perspective, just like all its predecessors. Your 
party roams about the world, fighting random 
enemies, performing quests, and defeating bosses. 
The novelty is in the game's unusual story, which 
spans almost a lifetime of the hero. 
 
"Dragon Quest V" was not available outside of 
Japan until 2009, when the DS version was released 
in the United States.

Dragon Slayer - Eiyuu Densetsu (c) Feb 14, 1992 
Nihon Falcom Corp. / Epoch Co., Ltd. 
 
"Dragon Slayer" tells the story of a young prince 
named Selios. One day his old teacher Raiyas sends 
him to a nearby cave to retrieve a magic weapon. 
When the prince returns, he finds the house 
attacked by monsters. Raiyas tells him to seek 
help in the castle of a baron, whose country has 
always been allies with theirs for a long time. 
However, the baron betrays Selios' trust and 
imprisons him. The young prince manages to escape, 
but without the possibility to return he has no 
choice but to wander through the land, trying to 
find trustworthy companions who would help him to 
save his country. 
 
This is a traditional medieval-themed Japanese RPG 
with turn-based combat viewed from first-person 
perspective (like in  Dragon Warrior games). The 
enemies are semi-random: they do appear out of 
nowhere and attack suddenly, but they are visible 
on the screen, and if you flee from a battle they 
will still be there to pursue you.

Nihon Falcom Corp. / Epoch Co., Ltd. 
 
Years have passed since prince Selios, the hero of 
the first game, defeated the demon god Agunija in 
the ultimate battle. Peace returned to the land of 
Iseruhasa. Selios married his sweetheart Dina, and 
they had a child, whom they gave the name Atlas. 
At the age of fifteen, Atlas was already a strong 
warrior, thanks to the lessons of his teacher 
Lowel. Everything seemed peaceful in the country, 
until two warriors spotted strange creatures near 
the capital city. Those were... men in space 
suits! Of course, the warriors could not have 
known this and believed them to be monsters. Do 
the mysterious strangers have peaceful intentions, 
or are they a new threat to the kingdom? 
 
The second "Dragon Slayer" is very similar to the 
first game, graphically and gameplay-wise. The 
only major difference is the fact that the enemies 
are now completely visible on screen before 
battles, so that the player can avoid fighting 
them if he wants to. Otherwise, it is a 
traditional Japanese RPG with turn-based combat 
viewed from first-person perspective. The Genesis 
version has once again updated graphics.

Konami's Castlevania games. 
 
The story begins with our hero, Dirk the Daring, 
on a quest to rescue the Princess Daphne from the 
evil dragon, Singe. However, before he can rescue 
the princess, he must first overcome 24 levels 
filled with enemies and obstacles.  Fortunately, 
Dirk has both his trusty sword and the ability to 
used ranged weapons (axes, knives, & shuriken) at

ANHAK DRAKKHEN AGHNAHIR HURTHD! 
 
The prophecy has been fulfilled. The world shall 
be ruled by the dragons. On an island far away, 
their lords prepare for the conquest of the lands. 
There is only one hope for mankind. The emperor 
sends out four heroes -- warriors and magicians -- 
to solve the puzzle of tears and prevent the 
invasion of the Drakkhen. 
 
Drakkhen is a role-playing game with several 
ingenious features for its time. The eye-catcher 
is a mix of fast 3D landscapes and 2D interiors. 
The player's party will travel overland on a flat 
terrain made up of vectors, on which 2D objects 
are zoomed (The same type of engine was later used 
in Eternam). The player will encounter monsters 
and fight them in real-time combat, and discover 
the palaces of the dragon lords. Indoors, the 
player has to find a way through the maze of 
chambers, solving puzzles and defeating the 
minions of the Drakkhen. Party members are 
depicted in four status windows on the left side 
of the screen, thus allowing to see their current 
status and equipment at once.

In an alternate reality, in a parallel world, 
there are humans just like in the universe we

with animals, fairies, and dragons - other 
inhabitants of the world. The dragons were the 
wisest, most ancient, and most powerful race of 
all. But humans feared their wisdom and their 
strength, and lost contact to them, destroying the 
balance in the world. Now, only a few dragons 
remained, and their whereabouts are shrouded in 
mystery... 
 
You control Ralph, a young fighter apprentice who 
lives with his old master in a small house near a 
village. It is the day of your graduation, and the 
master sends you to meet a very important person. 
When you arrive at this person's hut, you are 
spoken to by the spirit of a mighty dragon, the 
creator of the universe! You, the young 
adventurer, is chosen to stop an evil spirit who 
tries to destroy the universe, and as a token you 
receive a magic Orb, which contains the soul of 
the great dragon. And there your adventure 
begins... 
 
"Dual Orb" is a traditional console-style RPG with 
turn-based combat viewed from first-person 
perspective. As Ralph ventures further on his 
journey, he discovers companions who will help him 
on his quest, and join his party.

avatar attacks by slashing to the right with his

level that can be used to destroy all enemies 
onscreen at any time, and it will be replaced 
whenever a life is lost. Environments range from 
city streets to sewers and a flying battleship.

Emerald Dragon (c) Jul 28, 1995 Glodia / Media 
Works Inc. 
 
In "Emerald Dragon", you play as Atrushan, a blue 
dragon who lives in the Dragon World. One day, he 
and his friends discover a ship wreck near a 
mountain. After examining the wreck, the dragons 
find a human child - a little girl. The wise White 
Dragon, the leader of the dragons, tells them that 
her name is Tamryn and that she will play an 
important role in their lives. The girl doesn't 
remember anything, and grows up together with the 
dragons. But when she turns fifteen, she decides 
to go back to her homeland - the Human World. Soon 
after Tamryn has left, Atrushan realizes he can't 
bear the separation, and asks the White Dragon to 
allow him to go and find Tamryn in the Human 
World. But a mysterious evil curse has been placed 
on the dragons - they can't appear among the 
humans in their true form. Atrushan agrees to 
become a human and goes to the Human World - to 
find Tamryn, and also a way to remove the curse... 
 
The game features traditional Japanese-style RPG 
gameplay - Atrushan and his party travel over 
world map, visiting towns and descending into 
dungeons. The battle system is somewhat unusual - 
you can control only Atrushan, while other party 
members are controlled by the AI. You have a 
special bar for your actions in battle: once it is 
depleted, you can't perform any action and must 
wait for your next turn. You can move freely over 
the battle field, position yourself strategically 
near or far away from the enemy, attack from 
different sides, and assign general strategies to 
your non-controllable party members.

ESPN Speed World is a generic racing game that is 
made to resemble NASCAR.  The player is given a 
stock car and can tune the car from the angle of 
the spoiler, to the setting of the shocks, and up 
to the pressure of the tires. 
 
There are three different types of speedways to 
race on: Super Speedway, Short Track and Road 
Courses  with 5 different tracks for each to 
choose from.  Players can choose to race against 
the computer that has all 23 other stock cars on 
the track at once or play head-to-head on a split 
screen against a friend. 
 
It also featured realistic driving physics.  While 
it didn't have a NASCAR license, it did have ESPN 
which broadcasted the races and had NASCAR 
analyst, Dr. Jerry Punch, who lent his voice to 
the game for the color commentary.

E.V.O. Search for Eden (c) 1993 Almanic Corp. / 
  Enix Corporation 
 
The storyline of E.V.O.: Search for Eden follows 
the same patterns as modern Evolution theories. 
The players first controls a prehistoric sea 
organism, and fights to gain evolution points with 
which he can improve his fish's body parts and 
upgrade his attack/defense abilities. The gameplay 
is not completely linear, which means that certain 
choices of paths and stages will affect the 
player's success. 
The game is composed of a series of stages, in 
which the sea organism slowly evolves into an 
amphibian, and later a land-only creature. The 
physical changes are fairly scientifically 
accurate which gives the game a semi-educational 
purpose as well.

F1 ROC II - Race of Champions (c) 1994 SETA 
Corporation / SETA U.S.A., Inc. 
 
F1ROC II: Race of Champions is the follow-up 
sequel to F1ROC: Race of Champions where the 
player can race to become a legend in Formula One 
racing, but first must have to go through three 
different tiers of racing in order to do so. 
 
The player starts out in "Group C" in the lowest 
tier with less powerful cars and novice drivers.  
After winning the eight races of "Group C", the 
player is then transferred to F-3000 with more 
advance drivers and powerful cars.  The player 
must win another eight tracks in this division to 
advance to the final division, the F-1 Grand Prix 
itself, with the most advanced cars and the most 
talented drivers and to win this series the player 
must compete in 16 tracks.  If the player does 
well enough, they can return to the Grand Prix 
division the following year with the ability to 
choose a new car and sponsor. 
 
The main gameplay is a basic racing game, but does 
not involve oval tracks such as NASCAR, but 
twisting and turning tracks where the player must 
use caution when turning on winding roads.  
Players can also qualify before races for a better 
starting spot and must make pit stops during races 
to replace fuel, tires and repair damage. The 
player can also win prize money for doing well in 
races to buy better parts and upgrades for their 
car to race better in future races.  They must be 
careful, however, when combining parts to try and 
make a perfect handling car.  If the player uses 
the wrong combination, they can have a car that 
handles well in turns, but is slow on long 
straightaways.  Likewise, they can also become to 
fast and dangerous in turns, causing disastrous 
accidents. 
 
It features a battery back-up to save games and 
stats and also features authentic Formula One cars 
such as the FW14B Williams, the McLaren MP4, the 
Benettion B192,  the F92 Ferrari among many others 
and also has the entire 1992 F-1 racing season.

for your car. You need to find a good balance 
between the parts. To test the effectiveness of 
your parts you can run a test race to see how the

"Farland Story" in the first in the row of 
successful Japanese strategy RPG games. The main 
hero of the game is a knight named Arc, who is in 
love with the beautiful priestess Ferio. One day, 
when Arc and his best friend Randia are out of 
town, a hostile army under the command of a 
mysterious Black Knight invades the town and 
kidnaps Ferio. Thus begins Arc's quest to defeat 
the enemies and to rescue his beloved one from 
their clutches. 
 
"Farland Story" consists entirely of battles (save 
cut scenes and the ability to shop if you are near 
a town after a battle). During battles, you move 
Arc and his party over the terrain, and attack 
when there are enemies in range. The party 
consists of different classes - knights attack 
with swords, archers specialize in long-ranged 
combat, priestesses heal, etc. Every attack leads 
to a counter-attack, from the enemy's side as well 
as from yours. You gain experience points for 
every attack, and can level up in the middle of a 
battle.

Farland Story 2 is an independent side-story to 
the Farland Story series (this game shouldn't be 
confused with  Farland Story Denki: Arc Ou no 
Ensei, which is also known as "Farland Story 2"). 
The game is set in the same time line as the 
second and the third "mainstream" Farland Story 
games, 20 years after Arc has become a king. Peace 
has returned to the world, but on the continent of 
Ionia, an emperor is plotting an evil scheme. His 
son Riad refuses to accept the methods of his 
father, especially when he wants to use Serena, a 
girl he loves, for his plans of war and conquest. 
During a quarrel, Riad attacks the emperor's 
minister, and is forced to flee the castle 
together with Serena. The adventure of the runaway 
prince begins... 
 
Graphically and gameplay-wise, the game is similar 
to other Farland Story games, although its setting 
is generally more dark. The game consists of large 
strategic battles, during which you move your 
party over the battle location, attacking enemies 
physically when they are in range of your weapons, 
and casting healing and offensive magic. Like in 
other Farland Story games, the death of the main 
character (Riad in this case) means instant Game 
Over.

Feda - The Emblem of Justice (c) Oct 28, 1994 Max 
Entertainment / Yanoman Corporation 
 
In a fantasy world, a soldier from the imperial 
forces deserts after witnessing the massacre of 
innocent villagers by his unit. He is sent to jail 
to be executed, but manages to escape with the 
help of two former unit colleagues. The group 
flees through the country-side, while being 
pursued by imperial soldiers. On their way, they 
join forces with other rebels to fight against the 
enemy, while uncovering hidden secrets and evil 
plots by the Empire. 
 
FEDA: Emblem of Justice is a strategy RPG similar 
to Shining Force and other titles with preset 
characters and linear gameplay. The player 
commands a party of varying size and characters 
with diverse skills. 
 
In the main battle sections, the player and the 
CPU-controlled enemy take turns moving the troops 
and giving orders. A menu at the bottom of the 
screen shows all the possible actions, where 
soldiers can defend, move, attack, or use an 
inventory item on each turn. The range of their 
movements and weapons vary according to their 
nature. A crossbow character can shoot from the 
back, while most sword and knife users have to be 
adjacent to their targets. Magic offensive powers 
have different ranges as well, reaching enemies 
that are far away from the attacking character. 
Health points can be recovered by eating rations 
or by magic, where a healer can restore points to 
several characters at once. 
 
Each party member has separate health and magic 
points, as well as other statistics like defense 
and attack power. They receive experience points 
after slaying an enemy or casting a spell, and 
extra points at the end of the battle. Their 
skills increase after surpassing 100 points. 
 
The map screen shows the party and groups of 
enemies traveling through the landscape in turns. 
The menu has options for moving the group or 
camping. In the encampment, one of the characters 
around the fire pit saves the game, while another 
inside the tent provides system options to change 
the interface color, adjust sound volume and 
rename the party members. 
 
In some locations like temples, villages and 
towns, the party has to explore the place and talk 
to the citizens to move on to the next section. In 
later battles, the player has to make a moral 
choice about attacking mutated humans. At the end 
of each battle, the party is assigned a dark or 
light emblem, and certain party members choose to 
leave or stay in the group based on its alignment.

FIFA International Soccer (c) 1994 Extended Play 
Productions / Electronic Arts, Inc. 
 
The game that started the best-selling series 
licensed by football's world governing body, this 
first installment in the long running series used 
a dimetric (colloquially known as "isometric") 
viewpoint, previously unusual in football games 
but quickly imitated by several titles. The 
televisual presentation, one of the unique points 
of the early EA Sports titles, with hosts 
introducing the matches, was another thing making 
the game stand out from a market dominated by 
Sensible Soccer and Kick Off games. 
 
Based on international teams (with fictional 
player names), their abilities in each skill area 
rated out of 10 to give the player an overall 
impression of how good they are. The options 
available follow the standard set: fouls and 
offsides can be toggled on and off, the match 
length can be set, and if the timer operates  
continuously, or only while the ball is in play. 
Gameplay privileges quick runs, short passes and 
blistering shots outside the penalty box, and set 
pieces are controlled by moving a box into the 
target area for the ball, and then passed, lobbed 
or kicked directly. On the tactical side, 
formations can be selected, with 5 different 
strategies also available (although not all of 
these combinations make sense) as can the team 
Coverage - the areas which defenders, midfielders 
and strikers cover.

FIFA Soccer 96 (c) 1995 Extended Play Productions 
/ Electronic Arts, Inc. 
 
"Aiming to be the first football simulation that 
is realistic in the true sense of the word, FIFA 
Soccer 96 was extremely popular at the time of 
release. It was hailed as the first really 
successful FIFA release, and opened the way for 
yearly revisions of the concept. 
 
There were a number of factors that made FIFA96 
stand out from the crowd of other football sims. 
Firstly, the game's commentary was revolutionary 
at the time -- the renowned British commentator 
John Motson comments all the incidents and 
happenings on the pitch in real-time. The ambient 
commentary is varied, and systems with more than 
the minimum memory level get extra commentary 
phrases. 
 
The Virtual Stadium technology has numerous 
pre-defined camera angles. The game even has a 
SVGA mode for better-than-minimum system 
 
FIFA96 boasts eleven leagues from all around the 
world, ranging from the unknown players of the 
Malaysian league to the celebrated stars of the 
English and Italian leagues. 59 International 
teams are also featured, and it's possible to 
match the teams you want to against each other 
through friendlies, or you can also choose to play 
domestic tournaments or International ones such as 
the World Cup. If you're not satisfied with the 
composition of the various teams, you can create 
your own dream team through the custom team 
creator.

Final Fantasy II (c) Nov, 1991 Square Co., Ltd. / 
Square Soft, Inc. 
 
This is the fourth entry in the  Final Fantasy 
series. It was known as Final Fantasy II 
internationally, because the  second and third 
games were never released outside of Japan. 
 
The military country of Baron is one of the 
strongest in the land, with a proud army and a 
majestic air force known as the Red Wings. But, 
while their armies are kind and loyal, the recent 
actions of the King are anything but. The young 
Captain of the Red Wings, Cecil, is ordered to 
steal a crystal from a village of innocent 
magicians, and when he questions the actions of 
his King, Cecil is immediately thrown out of the 
country and sent off to kill strange monsters. 
Little does he realize the price the King's 
actions will pay, and what the true secret of the 
crystals, and their powers, truly is... 
 
This is the first Final Fantasy game that 
introduced the famous ATB (active-time battle) 
system: during the battles, you have a time 
indicator for each party member that tells you 
when this character is able to act. If it takes 
you too long to select a command for this 
character, the enemy will act without waiting for 
your turn. The game abandons the job system that 
was implemented in the  first and the  third game 
in favor of pre-set character classes (paladin, 
white mage, ninja, etc.) assigned to each party 
member. 
 
The PlayStation version adds a new rendered intro 
and ending.

Final Fantasy III (c) Oct, 1994 Square Co., Ltd. / 
Square Soft, Inc. 
 
This is the sixth entry in the  Final Fantasy 
series. It was called Final Fantasy III because 
three of the five previous installments of the 
series were never released outside of Japan. 
 
1,000 years ago, the War of the Magi occurred. 
People remember it as one of the most horrible 
tragedies in history. Since the War of the Magi, 
magic has been all but forgotten, technology began 
to grow, and people returned to seemingly normal 
lives. The only true worry people had was the 
Empire, whose leaders were looking to revive the 
great force once known as "magic". 
 
But then...something happened that would change 
the course of history forever... 
 
The Empire had heard word of the remains of a 
mystical being, known as an "Esper", being found 
in the mining town of Narshe. Quickly, three 
soldiers were dispatched to find this Esper and 
bring it to the Emperor. One of the soldiers, a 
young girl, triggers a power in the Esper that 
will begin one of the most dangerous series of 
events ever. And the only ones who can help her 
are a rag-tag band of rebels and heroes, whose 
very hearts and souls are the only ones that can 
save the world from the mad plans of the Empire. 
 
The game maintains the ATB (active time battle) 
system of the two previous  Final Fantasy games, 
spicing classic turn-based combat engine with a 
real-time element. The customization system 
combines character-specific classes with 
free-flowing character development. By finding 
various Espers and equipping them on characters, 
you can improve their parameters in different ways 
and choose the magic spells you want to learn for 
each character.

Final Fantasy V (c) Dec 06, 1992 Square Co., Ltd. 
/ Square Co., Ltd. 
 
The Elemental Crystals...the life source of the 
planet. With them, gentle winds blow, the seas are 
active, fire burns bright, and the earth is full 
of life. All seems well in the world, until the 
wind suddenly stops, the sea begin to grow 
stagnant, the heat of fire becomes scarce, and the 
earth begins to wither. King Tycoon, sensing a 
premonition of evil, hurries off to check on the 
Wind Crystal, only to witness it destroy itself. 
 
Meanwhile, a young traveler named Butz is camping 
in a field when a giant meteor strikes the planet. 
When he heads out to examine the meteor, he is 
shocked to find a young girl named Lenna, who is 
the princess of Tycoon, and a old man named Galuf, 
who is on a critical mission. Later, joined by 
Faris, a pirate captain, the foursome must travel 
the land in search of the destructor of the 
Crystals, and save the planet at any cost! 
 
Final Fantasy V featured many new gameplay options 
and tactics, including an improved Job/Ability 
system (like in Final Fantasy Tactics), the return 
of the ATB (Active Time Battle) turn system, and 
all of the classic FF gameplay you've come to know 
and love! 
 
Final Fantasy V was released as a stand-alone game 
in Japan, and again in Final Fantasy Collection. 
Its U.S. debut was as part of Final Fantasy 
Anthology. It was also later ported to the Gameboy 
Advance, adding 4 new Jobs, a new 30-floor 
dungeon, a bestiary, a music player, the ability 
to quick save anywhere, a few extra pieces of 
equipment, and a newly update translation.

Final Fantasy - Mystic Quest (c) Oct, 1992 Square 
Co., Ltd. / Square Soft, Inc. 
 
Focus Tower is the center of the world and 
balances the forces of the world. However 4 
monsters have taken the 4 elemental crystals 
(Earth, Water, Fire, Wind) for their own use, and 
also taken the 4 keys that for doors inside of 
Focus Tower. With the balance disrupted, disasters 
befall the world. A young boy by the name of 
Benjamin finds his home village destroyed. Meeting 
a mysterious old man while trying to escape from 
earthquakes, he soon learns that he is the 
prophesized hero and the only one who can save the 
world. Benjamin must recover the 4 crystals, 
unlock Focus Tower and defeat the ultimate monster 
before the 5th crystal, the Crystal of Life is 
corrupted. 
 
Final Fantasy: Mystic Quest is an RPG game, shown 
from an overhead view for movement within areas 
and using a 3rd person view for battles. The game 
is divided into "areas" on the world map between 
which the player can freely jump. These areas are 
divided into Towns, Dungeons and Battle Areas. 
Towns feature characters to interact and talk to, 
Dungeons are mazes filled with monsters and Battle 
Areas are instant battles with specific monsters, 
completion of which sometimes awards special 
items. Inside a Dungeon or Town, the player moves 
from an overhead view, with he ability to jump, 
use weapon at whatever is in front of the 
character, interact with NPCs and attack monsters. 
 
Unlike other Final Fantasy games, there are no 
random battles, all the enemies are visible to the 
player (or in specific "Battle Areas").  During 
battle, the game features turn-based combat (but 
not the "ATB battle system" used in other Final 
Fantasy games) where the player chooses from 
battle commands such as Attack, Defend, Item and 
Spells. 
 
Also unlike other Final Fantasy games, the 
player's party only ever consists of two 
characters: Benjamin and another character who can 
either by controlled manually or automatically by 
the AI. Benjamin can collect armor for 4 different 
parts of the body as well as 4 different kinds of 
weapons, however the other party member cannot 
have their equipment changed. 
 
Players can save at any point in the game. If the 
player is defeated in a battle, the game will let 
the battle be retried, but any items used will be 
lost.

to send you in to infiltrate their base and 
destroy them before they have a chance to unleash 
the war upon the rest of the world. You can choose 
to control either the Helicoptor or the Jeep, 
which have different advantages -- for instance, 
the Helicoptor is not obstructed by obstacles but 
the Jeep can fire in any direction. There are nine 
weapons (five permanent, four short-lasting 
specials) you can pick up along the way to help

Intelligent Systems Co., Ltd. / Nintendo Co., Ltd. 
 
The fourth installment in the popular strategy 
series, set in the continent of Jugdral, southeast 
of Akaneia. The game's first fifth chapters follow 
the Prince of Chalphy, Sigurd -- from there, his 
son Celis becomes the protagonist. The game uses 
the same turn-based strategy gameplay as its 
predecessors, but changes up the promotion system 
by making it entirely level-based, adds RPG-style 
status effects, and introduces the concept of the 
weapons triangle, in that a sword is strong 
against an axe, spear against the sword, and axe 
against the spear. Seisen no Keifu also featured 
much larger maps than previous titles (though a 
lower number of them -- 12 in all) and a handful 
of new units, such as the Troubadour, Dragon 
Master, and Falcon Knight. The game was released 
late in the Super Famicom's lifecycle in Japan and 
never published internationally.

Features introduced into this part of the series 
include fog of war and night maps with limited

Fire Striker (c) 1994 Axes Art Amuse|Hect Co. Ltd. 
/ DTMC, Inc. 
 
A long time ago the kingdoms of wind, fire, earth 
and water 
competed for the Trialight, a weapon created by 
the Arch Mage Wylde that can only be used by a 
Firestriker. The kingdom of wind won and united 
the four kingdoms. Wylde however, was not 
satisfied with peace and conjured four monsters to 
overthrow the united world. Now, only the kingdom 
of wind remains and the player takes control over 
the last Firestriker to free the other kingdoms 
and defeat the monsters. 
 
Even though Firestriker looks like a typical SNES 
RPG, it is in fact an action game that has more in 
common with a pinball-game than with any other 
genre. The Trialight is a ball of fire that 
basically behaves like a pinball. The player 
controls the Firestriker who can freely walk 
across the screen and strike at the Trialight to 
control its movement. Levels are filled with 
obstacles, destroyable block and monsters. 
Monsters and blocks can only be destroyed by the 
Trialight. The goal of each level is to maneuver 
the Trialight towards the exit of the screen. The 
exit is usually blocked by destroyable obstacles 
and sometimes certain conditions (such as killing 
all monsters or destroying certain objects) have 
to be fulfilled before a level can be completed. 
If the Firestriker is killed or the Trialight 
falls off the screen, the player loses a life. 
Additionally to the Firestriker, the player can 
use the shoulder buttons to control a magician who 
(in single player mode) stays at the bottom of the 
screen. The levels consist of several screens and 
are entered from a world map. As the game 
progresses, the player will also fight several 
bosses and free other Firestrikers whose special 
abilities are necessary to complete the game. 
 
Firestriker also features a two-player cooperative 
mode as well as a duel-mode for up to four 
players.

First Queen - Ornic Senki (c) Mar 11, 1994 Culture 
Brain Inc. / Culture Brain Inc. 
 
Ornic Senki is a remake of  First Queen. The game 
retains the basic gameplay and the story of the 
original. Some scenes and dialogues were added 
(for example, the intro features a detailed 
account of what happened in different kingdoms 
after the Ornic invasion, which was absent in the 
original version). The battle system remains the 
same, but the player has more options to customize 
the party AI. Also, instead of choosing locations 
from a menu and being able to view the world map 
only before major battles, the player is actually 
navigating the world map now, physically moving to 
the dots that represent locations. 
 
The remake features new musical compositions and 
sound effects, as well as more detailed 16-bit 
graphics.

Defenceless against the Demon's magic, you succumb 
to his powers, leaving the your Master to fight 
the Demon King alone. Your master falls in combat, 
dying. But, with his last breath, he summons the

escapes to the future. Tormented, the young 
samurai seeks the teachings of the Wizard Mage in 
the ways of magic. Boiled with revenge and armed 
with a magical sword, the young samurai follows 
the Demon King into the future and the unknown..." 
 
The First Samurai is a platform action game very 
much similar to other platform games, but with a 
medieval oriental touch to it in addition to 
various unique features. 
 
Arriving in the new unknown land, you are 
defenceless hence your fists and kicks. But as you 
journey forth, you'll find your trusty magical 
sword as well as throwing weapons such as knives 
and axes. With your martial art skills, your enemy 
best beware with those sudden moves that may prove 
fatal! 
 
The First Samurai offers a wide array of weapons, 
special items and other objects. Combat is usually 
melee, either relying on your punch or kicks or 
using the magical sword to slash some pretty 
skillful blows in whatever direction possible. 
 
Monsters are forever regenerating but food for 
health is plentiful. It actually takes an effort 
to be killed...

Flintstones, The - The Treasure of Sierra Madrock 
(c) Mar, 1994 Taito Corporation / Taito 
Corporation 
 
The Great Poobah has retired and is looking for a 
successor. Since there are so many candidates, it 
is decided that the person who finds the Great 
Treasure of Sierra Madrock will become the new 
Great Poobah. 
The player takes control over Fred and Barney who 
also participate in the treasure hunt in order to 
make Fred the New Great Poobah. 
 
The Flintstones: The Treasure of Sierra Madrock is 
a side-scrolling platformer that includes several 
board game elements. On a world map, Fred and 
Barney  throw dices to determine how many fields 
they can move. 
 
There are different fields that hold different 
challenges. 
 
Most fields require you to finish a side-scrolling 
platforming level. Fred and Barney can jump, club 
their enemies and climb trees or stone pillars. 
Holding down the jump button lets them hover in 
the air for a short moment. Throughout the levels, 
different power-ups and items can be found: clamps 
are used as money, apples replenish some health, 
100 stars grant an extra life to Barney or Fred 
and an empty Heart frame increases their life bar. 
 
On fields marked with a skull, a boss has to be 
defeated. 
 
Heart fields hold bonus games in which you have to 
collect as many items as possible within the time 
limit. 
 
At amusement parks, several mini-games can be 
played to win items or extra lives. Mini-games 
include: Memory

From TV Animation Slam Dunk - SD Heat Up!! (c)

Among the most famous Japanese comics of the 90s 
are definitely Slam Dunk. The manga tells of the 
running track that will make the young hoodlum 
Hanamichi Sakuragi who joined the basketball club 
in Shohoku high school just because initially 
interested in the sister of the captain Akagi but 
later this sport will conquer him so much that he 
becomes a real basketman. 
 
The game is essentially an arcade sports title 
basketball basically. The main screen there will 
be little choice given the presence of only three 
modes: Story mode and classic friendly tournament. 
In the first we follow the events of the 
television series whose plot differs slightly from 
the original one: using Shohoku then we will 
qualify for the national championship. The second 
and third but I think there is a need for further 
explanation. 
 
Executable field operations would also be 
different, you can also feint shots and blow up 
their opponents markers. Then successfully 
accumulating a sequence of 'affirmative action' 
row (steps succeeded, baskets made or avoided), 
will fill a horizontal bar at the top of the 
screen and, as he did a little 'in the playroom 
with the SNK Street Hoop, pressing simultaneously 
the three keys will not dorsal (except B), you can 
make a super nice shooting with supplemental 
animations depending on the player used.

The year is 2064, when the great solar power 
satellite, ATLAS is overshadowed by the invention 
of fusion power. The government alliance that had 
supported the building of ATLAS now find 
themselves facing economic crisis as the balance 
of power shifts. In this world of conflict and 
change, the Walking Panzer, or Wanzer, (a form of 
mecha) becomes the standard armored unit for wars 
and petty battles across the globe. For the small 
nation of Bergen, a coup d'etat is underway, 
staged by Colonel Ark. Seeking to establish 
complete control over the government and the NORAD 
units stationed there, Ark's first step involves 
the capture of President Orwen. Tipped off to the 
rebellion, Orwen seeks to flee from Bergen, 
looking for safe passage out of the seaport of 
Port Ertothal. A young Wanzer pilot, Albert 
Grabner, is assigned escort duty to the president 
by loyal elements of the army stationed there... 
 
Gun Hazard is a side-scrolling version of the 
Front Mission series. Gameplay is more than a 
little similar to Cybernator or Metal Warriors. 
The player moves between different stages on an 
area map. Once inside a level, the player controls 
Albert and his wanzer as it moves left, right 
across the screen. The wanzer is able to jump, and 
attack with a primary and a special weapon. At any 
time during a level, Albert can eject from his 
heavily armed wanzer to explore. Although 
vulnerable when outside, Albert is able to reach 
areas the wanzer cannot, in addition to being a 
smaller target and being able to jetpack 
indefinitely. 
 
Additionally, Albert can recruit other characters 
through the normal course of the story, some of 
whom can be designated to support roles. These 
support characters when set can provide a variety 
of different cover fire abilities for Albert 
during his missions. They too gain experience and 
levels. Different weapons and armor can be found 
or bought. Essential components include the 
Booster ability which allows the wanzer to hover 
and increase it's jumps, as well as the Dash 
ability which allows quick left-right movement by 
the wanzer. Money and experience are earned 
through the completion of level objectives as well 
as the kill count of enemy wanzers.

The legend of the Golden Condor... from village to

it - somewhere, beyond forests and mountains, 
there lies an idyllic Golden Land, the land of 
eternal happiness. Many adventurers have tried to 
find their way to the mysterious land of the 
Golden Condor, but how many of them have survived 
the impassable mountain paths, the dark forests 
and caves, and the vicious monsters? You are the 
wanderer Shiren, and the goal of your life is to 
find the Golden Land. Together with your best 
buddy Koppa, a talking weasel, you decide to 
venture deep into the dungeons that lead to the 
land, and to try your luck there. 
 
Furai no Shiren (The Wanderer Shiren) is a 
roguelike, hack-and-slash game with randomly 
generated dungeon areas, items, and monsters. 
Despite being named Fushigi no Dungeon 2 it has no 
relation to the storyline or characters of the

the same style of gameplay. The movement is 
turn-based. You visit towns and villages where you 
can buy and sell supplies. The dungeons are full 
of various traps and monsters, and sometimes 
non-playable characters you can talk to, some of 
which can join you on your quest.

F-Zero (c) Aug, 1991 Nintendo Co., Ltd. / 
  Nintendo of America Inc. 
 
F-Zero is a futuristic racing game, set in the 
  year 2560. The player chooses one of the four 
  available hovercars and then can race with other 
  hovercars in one of the gameplay modes - 
  "Practice" or "Grand Prix". 
 
In "Practice" mode, the player chooses one track 
where he competes with one other hovercar to win 
the race (or there can be no rival at all, if you 
so wish). In "Grand Prix", the player must 
complete a series of races with several 
competitors. Each race consists of five laps. 
 
The hovercar has a limited Power meter, which 
represents the machine's health and decreases when 
the hovercar collides with the track boundaries 
and other players. If power runs out, the hovercar 
explodes and the player loses the race. There are 
repair areas near the start line, which restore 
power to the player's hovercar if he drives into 
them. The tracks contain many more or less 
dangerous traps, such as icefields or landmines. 
 
Completing a lap awards the player a "Super Jet" 
which can be activated at any time to give a short 
speed boost. The hovercar can keep up to three 
Super Jets and use them when necessary. 
 
Completing a lap also gives points, which give the 
player a life when enough are accumulated. The 
player can lose a life in the Grand Prix mode if 
his hovercar explodes, if his hovercar somehow 
falls out of the track or if he ends up too far 
behind the other racers.

Galaxy Wars (c) Jan 13, 1995 Universal Co., Ltd. / 
Imagineer Co., Ltd. 
 
Home version of the 1979 arcade game of the same 
name. The aim is to launch missiles from the 
bottom of the screen at enemy spacecraft located 
at the top. To get there, the missile must pass 
through a asteroid belt flying across the screen 
and avoid the shots being fired down from the 
spacecraft. It is the players job to control the 
missile. Once launched it can be moved left and 
right and can be sped up by using the boost to 
speed it's way out of trouble. Points scored 
depend on the location of the hit on the enemy 
spacecraft. The speed at which enemy spacecraft 
move increases as the number of them decreases. 
Once all spacecraft have been destroyed, another 
wave starts, the speed decreases again and the 
process repeats. A life is lost when a missile is 
hit by a shot or collides with an asteroid. 
 
Three game modes are available, B&W and Color 
recreate the graphics and behaviour of the 
original arcade game in black & white and color 
respectively whilst Neo mode updates the game with 
improved graphics and slightly different 
behaviour. There's also a turn-based two player 
mode. Other options include changing the number of 
lives available at the start of a game and the 
number of points needed for an extra ship.

Hammerin' Harry and his friends have brought

front gate, watching it shine. They also watch a

revenge on those responsible for the bombing. 
 
In Ganbare Daiku no Gensan, you must go through 
five stages (with two areas each), destroying 
workers that get in your way using your mallet. 
You can use it to perform two special attacks. One 
that sends fireballs going in all directions, and 
a more powerful one that sends shockwaves, 
destroying everything on screen. At the end of 
each area, a boss needs to be defeated in order to 
proceed to the next one.

Third title in the Ganbare Goemon series of 
platform/adventure games which cast you as the 
heroic Goemon as he attempts to save feudal Japan 
from all sorts of wacky evildoers. This time 
around, a time-travelling machine threatens all of 
Japan and thus Goemon and co. must jump into the 
future to stop the machine. 
 
The game alternates between a top-down world map 
view in which your characters explore the 
gameworld and side-scrolling stages in which the 
main action lies. As in most games of the series 
there are also loads of mini-games and unique 
gameplay sequences such as maneuvering Goemon's 
giant mecha. 
 
The game continues the tradition of bizarre humor 
unique to the series, you can play as either 
Goemon or any of his 3 companions, Ebisumaru, 
Sasuke or Yae with each sporting unique weapons 
and abilities and also with their own dialogue 
options and cutscenes, which feature sitcom-like 
pre-recorded laughs for added wackiness.

The game is based around a stage-select hub from 
which you select which character you want to play 
as and then attempt to clear the game's many side 
scrolling stages in standard action platformer 
fashion, navigating the obstacles and defeating 
all enemies you run into with your weapons. Since 
each one of Goemon's allies got stranded on a 
different planet, you must take control of each 
one of them in order to clear the stages and 
recover the special ability unique to each 
character that must be later put to use to release 
Goemon Impact. As in other games of the series 
there are also loads of mini-games and unique 
gameplay sequences triggered in boss fights, bonus 
stages and special situations. These involve 
shooter sequences, racing & sport games and other 
assorted diversions.

Ganpuru - Gunman's Proof (c) Jan 31, 1997 ASCII 
Corporation / ASCII Corporation 
 
The year is 1880. Two meteors fell on Earth on a 
small island near North American Pacific Coast. In 
the middle of the island there is a small town 
governed by a sheriff. At first, the town's 
inhabitants didn't pay attention to the meteors. 
But then, strange things started happening. 
Monsters attacked people, and left on the victims' 
bodies a mysterious crest with one word: demiseed. 
One day you, a young boy who lives in the town, 
are contacted by two aliens who came in a 
miniature space ship. One of the aliens introduces 
himself as Zero, the Space Sheriff, and explains 
that an intergalactic criminal named Demi has 
escaped from justice and is hiding somewhere on 
the island, being the cause of all the troubles 
lately. Zero then possesses your body, lends you 
his powers, and commands you on the quest to 
destroy Demi and to bring peace to your island and 
to the alien world alike! 
 
The game is an action/adventure with slight RPG 
elements (buying and upgrading weapons, etc.) set 
in Wild West. While featuring traditional 
dungeon-crawling and many enemies to dispose of in 
real time combat, the game doesn't equip you with 
standard medieval swords, but with pistols, 
shotgun, machine gun, and even a flamethrower. 
Your weapons have infinite ammo. You can duck to 
avoid the alien monsters' fire, and perform 
special attacks with various types of weapons.

but they can only hit helicopters. For ground 
based targets you must dash into them to ram them 
off the road. Your car's health is constantly 
dwindling, even when you're not being attacked by 
enemies, so picking up the occasionally appearing 
energy refill items is essential. Shields can be 
picked up and stored that will make your car 
invulnerable to all damage for a short while.

Genocide 2 (c) Aug 05, 1994 Bits Corporation / 
Kemco 
 
The world is still recovering from war. The 
mega-corporation CONEX has been spearheading the 
rebuilding process, but their true intentions are 
far from altruistic. By gobbling up their 
competition, and with the help of new weapons 
technology, CONEX is on the cusp of controlling 
the world. Only a hero from the last war can defy 
them and stop their plans of conquest. 
 
Genocide 2 is a modified version of the PC 
release. The player takes control of a ten meter 
tall robotic ninja: the Tracer. Its only form of 
attack is a sword, but it can hold several extra 
weapons, and always has access to the Betty. The 
Betty can be fired in eight directions, returns to 
the Tracer after being fired, and can block enemy 
bullets. The objective of each stage is to reach 
the end, and some stages require you to destroy 
targets along the way. Any items picked up by the 
player, or damage done to the Tracer, carries over 
between stages, and each stage records your 
fastest time for beating them. 
 
Aside from the visual downgrade, Genocide 2 also 
lost many minor enemy types and one mid-boss in 
the transition to the Super Famicom. The first 
stage was removed, and the first two levels of 
stage 2 were reversed. The Betty now can only be 
used for a limited time, and must recharge when 
its time has run out.

George Foreman's KO Boxing (c) 1992 Beam Software 
Pty., Ltd. / Acclaim Entertainment, Inc. 
 
Featuring heavyweight champion George Foreman, 
this is a boxing simulation where players, taking 
the role of Foreman, go through a series of twelve 
rounds against different boxers to win the 
championship title belt. 
 
Played from an third-person perspective using a 
view from right over the shoulders over the boxer, 
players can move left and right to dodge incoming 
punches, block and throw left and right punches. 
The standard punch is a cross, but by holding the 
Up-key pressed, jabs can also be thrown. 
 
By avoiding punches and hitting them, a superpunch 
often becomes available, inflicting much more 
damage. A fight consists of a maximum of three 
rounds of three minutes each. When a boxer is 
knocked down four times, the match is over 
(technical knock-out). The same happens when a 
boxer goes down three times in a single round 
(regular knock-out). When down, players need to 
press both punch buttons in rapid succession to 
get back to their feet. The screen shows an energy 
meter drained when punches are received. After 
being knocked down and during intermissions, some 
energy is restored. 
 
All versions, except for the Game Boy, can be 
played with two players. A password system is used 
to save the progress.

Ghost Chaser Densei (c) Sep 23, 1994 Winky Soft / 
Banpresto Co., Ltd. 
 
Ghost Chaser Densei doesn't take any dramatic 
departures from the standard scrolling-brawler 
plot-line. A city twenty minutes in the future 
must be saved from a terrorist organization, and 
between salvation and you is a long, straight line 
full of goons who must be punched. Aside from 
receiving orders from your boss before each level, 
and the quick conversation with a boss or rare 
NPC, the story won't attempt to get in the way of 
beat-downs. 
 
There are three playable characters in Ghost 
Chaser Densei: the martial artist Makai, the mace 
wielding cat-girl Iyo, and the autonomous robot 
Belva. Each has unique moves as well as the basic 
abilities of attacking, jumping, blocking, 
throwing, and using a special if attack and jump 
are pressed together. Unlike most brawlers these 
special moves deplete a recharging special bar, 
not your health. Makai can throw fireballs and do 
a flying kick in midair, Iyo can triangle jump and 
preform a spinning piledriver, and Belva can 
double jump and preform a grapple special. 
Characters also have a team up special if playing 
in two player mode. Enemies range from armored 
soldiers to lizard men to robots, but most break 
down into the same hierarchy: weaker types will 
rush at you while stronger types will shoot 
projectiles then rush at you. Each level ends with 
a unique boss with multiple short and long range 
attacks.

Gokujou Parodius (c) Nov 25, 1994 Konami Co., Ltd. 
/ Konami Co., Ltd. 
 
Konami's Gradius and space-shooter parody series 
continues with this second installment.  Gameplay 
is similar to the Gradius series in that you 
control a ship that can move anywhere on the 
screen while the screen itself scrolls from left 
to right. Enemies appear in waves and destroying 
all the fighters in a single wave releases 
power-ups which may be used to choose your ships 
upgrade. The Upgrade bar too is lifted from 
Gradius, however each character has different 
names and functions for their upgrades. 
 
In Gokujyou Parodius, you are now able to now 
choose from 11 different characters... many of 
whom appear from other Konami games. They include: 
 
1. Vic Viper: a ship from Gradius 
 
2. Takosuke: the "octopus" of the previous 
   Parodius game, and also seen in at least one 
   Goemon 
 
3. Twinbee: making his appearance from the 
   Twinbee side scrolling games, Twinbee is a 
   squat round robot with a jetpack and a 
   disproportionately big punching glove 
 
4. Pentaro: the original "joke character", 
   Pentaro made an appearence in a previous 
   Gradius title as a flying penguin. However he 
   does star in his own games as well, Konami's 
   Penguin Adventure 
 
5. Hikaru: Hikaru is a girl in a tight fighting 
   "bunny suit" who is riding on top of a missile 
 
6. Mambo: Mambo is a strange looking fish with 
   two horns on the top of his head and on his 
   underside 
 
7. Michael: some kind of fat angel pig. He has 
   wings and a golden halo over his head 
 
8. Koitsu: A blue stick man riding on a 
   surfboard. He's probably one of the more 
   'normal' characters 
 
9. Goemon: star of the Goemon series of games. 
   Goemon is a ninja warrior equipped with wooden 
   pipes. He flies around in a superman pose for 
   his appearance in Parodius 
 
10. Dracula: star of Konami's Kid Dracula, 
    this white haired squat character retains his 
    vampiric abilities including that of being 
    able to change into a bat 
 
11. Upa: a flying baby. Upa is actually from a 
    Konami game by the name of  Bokutte Upa but is 
    probably just more recognizable as "the flying 
    baby" of this crazy shooter 
 
In addition to your player-character, the levels 
themselves will be full of a strange mix of Konami 
references, bright colors and the just plain zany. 
it's not uncommon to have to fly your ship 
underneath a woman's legs for example or chased by 
a giant walrus or having enemies shooting cute 
pink hearts at you.

a ranged wave of energy, and he can also jump on 
some enemies to stun them before running into them 
and turning them into a sliding projectile. Ackman 
can hold up to three bombs that can clear the 
screen of enemies, and can also hold a weapon, 
either a sword, boomerang, or pistol, but it will 
be lost if Ackman is hit. Levels are linear, but 
do allow some exploration to find weapons and 
items hidden off the beaten road.

Go Go Ackman 2 (c) Jul 21, 1995 Banpresto Co., 
Ltd. / Banpresto Co., Ltd. 
 
Go Go Ackman 2 is mostly the same as its 
predecessor, with a few small tweaks. The angel 
Tenshi is still determined to end Ackman's 
nefarious ways, and this time he has enlisted the 
help of the angelic rock band Metal Angel. Ackman 
still murders at whim and has his companion Godon 
collect the souls of his slain, but this time 
Ackman can keep the weapons he finds, either 
sword, boomerang, or gun. Each weapon can be 
upgraded twice, but upgrades will be lost if 
Ackman is hit or finds a new weapon. Ackman can 
also now throw smaller enemies, although he can't 
move while holding them. 
 
Ackman 2 takes place over 5 stages filled with new 
bosses and enemies.

Ltd. / Banpresto Co., Ltd. 
 
Yet again Tenshi is hard at work on finding a way 
to kill off Ackman for good. But, what's this, it 
seems there's been a shake up in the chain of 
command, and now Tenshi is wanted by the Angel 
Police! Will Tenshi be able to clear his good 
name? Who's really pulling the strings here? And, 
most importantly, does Ackman care about any of 
this at all? 
 
The last of the Ackman games, Go Go Ackman 3 makes 
very few changes from Go Go Ackman 2, although 
Tenshi is now a playable character. Both Ackman 
and Tenshi can be switched between at special 
points in a level, but they share the same health 
meter and weapon. Unlike Ackman Tenshi can fly, 
but as he is an angel he can not collect the souls 
of enemies he kills. Souls have changed too, and 
are now used as currency in shops where Ackman can 
buy temporary powerups or healing. Finally Ackman 
has lost the ability to slide enemies along the 
ground, but he can now move while holding a 
stunned enemy.

Granhistoria - Genshi Sekaiki (c) Jun 30, 1995 
Banpresto Co., Ltd. / Banpresto Co., Ltd. 
 
You are a young man named Toru, and you are about 
to marry Lu, your sweetheart. Everything is ready 
for your marriage, the priest of the god Za your 
village worship is preparing to guide the 
ceremony. Strolling outside in the evening, you 
find a strange-looking shiny item. Immediately 
afterwards you are attacked by thieves and are... 
killed? A mysterious World Sphere contacts your 
soul and brings you back to life. But you are sent 
to the world a few hours into the past, just 
before the thieves' assault on you and on the 
village. You have to prevent the assault, to stop 
a chain of events, and to change world history! As 
you venture into the thieves' hideout to find out 
more about their plans, you find yourself involved 
in a struggle between the thieves' leader and the 
king's generals, and soon realize you must play a 
very important role in the history of the world... 
 
The gameplay of "Granhistoria" is connected to its 
main concept: changing the history. At any time, 
you can read about the latest events of the 
history of the world through the menu. Your 
decisions in the game influence the course of 
those events. You can choose with which party to 
join forces, and thus to lead history in different 
directions. 
 
The combat in the game is turn-based, and the 
enemies you encounter are random. Enemies attack 
from several sides, also from above, and you must 
often fight at several front simultaneously.

Great Waldo Search, The (c) 1993 Radiance Software 
/ THQ Inc. 
 
Based on the popular Where's Waldo series of 
books, the player's goal is to find Waldo, who is 
hidden in various pictures, before the time on the 
clock runs out. The player controls a magnifying 
glass and must click on various items for 
different effects. Finding a clock adds more time 
to the search, clicking on a 150 icon adds 150 
points to the score, etc. 
 
Each picture consists of 6 adjacent screens 
containing a continuous theme. The themes are The 
Carpet Flyers, The Underground Hunters, The 
Battling Monks, The Unfriendly Giants and The Land 
of Waldos. Players are given the option of playing 
on Normal difficulty, Expert difficulty, or 
playing the Land of Waldos stage. The only 
difference between the difficulties is that on 
expert there are no clock items to provide players 
with extra time. 
 
In all of the stages the player must find both 
Waldo and a scroll to complete the stage. Waldo 
must be found before the scroll in order to 
complete the stage. Waldo's dog Woof is also in 
each of these stages (except for the Land of 
Waldos) and by finding him players get to play a 
small bonus stage where they collect points as 
they control the dog on a flying carpet.

It's a quiet day at the Mikami Ghost Sweeping 
Company until a mysterious package arrives. It 
seems the "kindly" old store keeper Yakuchin found 
a magic statue and figured it would best be kept 
in Mikami's hands. Of course, where there's magic, 
there's wealth (or something like that), so Reiko 
sets out to find the seven gems needed to complete 
the statue. 
 
GS Mikami: Joreishi wa Nice Body is a side 
scrolling platform game based on the Ghost Sweeper 
Mikami manga and anime. The player controls Reiko 
who can fight off ghosts and monsters with her 
enchanted baton. The baton can be powered up to 
shoot lighting or icicles at an angle, but its 
power is lost if Reiko is hit. Reiko can only hold 
up to three special weapons, either a scroll that 
sucks enemies into it, or a gem that freezes time. 
Each "case" in the game is either one or two 
platforming levels long followed by a boss fight.

The player takes control of a soldier who is 
dropped off onto an island and must fight his way 
through hordes of enemy soldiers until he gets to 
the final showdown in order to protect Mother 
Earth from the invaders. 
 
Gameplay consists of moving forward and blasting 
all the enemies who get in the way. The player 
starts out with a normal gun, but can find other 
weapons throughout a level, such as a flamethrower 
or a laser gun. While the normal gun has an 
infinite amount of bullets, the other types of 
weapons will eventually run out of ammo. With 
these weapons, the player can shoot either 
straight, up, or on a diagonal. The player will 
also have the opportunity to commandeer a vehicle, 
which they can also fire bullets from. 
 
The player starts with 5 lives and 3 continues. 
Each of the stages must be defeated in a certain 
amount of time or the player loses one of those 
lives.

G.O.D - Mezameyo to Yobu Koe ga Kikoe (c) Dec 
  20, 1996 Infinity Co., Ltd.|Third Stage / 
  Imagineer Co., Ltd. 
 
The year is 1999. A boy named Gen lives together 
with his mother in a small Japanese city. One day 
he goes to the nearby mountains and discovers an 
underground cave. In this cave, he encounters a 
strange bat-like creature guarding what appears to 
be a huge diamond. When Gen approaches the 
diamond, the floor crumbles, and all he can see is 
a group of aliens descending on the Earth... 
 
Gen is awakened by a man in a military uniform. He 
quickly gets up, and notices a calender. The year 
is 2009! Ten years have passed, of which there is 
no recollection in Gen's memory. The world has 
changed a lot during those years. Aliens have 
invaded the Earth, many cities are destroyed, and 
he find himself amidst the members of an 
underground resistance movement. Now he has to 
travel all over the world, help the humans in 
their struggle, and discover the secret of the 
invasion. 
 
The game is a console-style RPG with randomly 
encountered enemies whom you fight in turn-based 
combat viewed from "over-the-shoulder" 
perspective, similar to Phantasy Star IV. Gen and 
other party members develop special powers called 
"chakra", which can be leveled up just like the 
characters themselves.

In Violinist of Hameln you play the role of Hamel, 
a sort of wanderer / adventurer whose weapon is… a 
violin. His music can cover enemies in fear, or 
even control their minds. Hamel and his mascot 
Oboe arrives at Staccato, a small town attacked by 
monsters, and drives them away with his power. 
Impressed, a cute little girl named Flute decides 
to go with Hamel in order to find and destroy the 
evil power behind the attacks. 
 
The game is typical platform. You play as Hamel, 
and with your violin can shoot musical notes to 
beat your enemies. However, you count with Flute’s 
aid. Flute follows you (although you can order her 
to stop and stay), but also can be grabbed and 
thrown at the enemies (yes, thrown at the 
enemies). Flute can also collect through all the 
stages some costumes that, when worn, give her 
special abilities, such as flying, leaping, 
breaking walls or even explode and kill all in 
screen. At the end of each stage, of course, 
you’ll find the typical boss, all named as musical 
instruments.

Hanjuku Eiyu is set in a semi-comical universe 
called the Egg World, populated by two nations: 
Hanjuku and Kanjuku, or soft-boiled and 
hard-boiled eggs, respectively. You take the role 
of the commander of the Hanjuku army, and your 
goal is to guide it successfully through a series 
of events (called "tales"), capturing enemy 
castles and defeating the bosses of the Kanjuku 
army. 
 
This is a real-time war strategy game. The game 
time is divided into months, each month taking a 
few minutes of real time. You control the hero and 
his generals, each one commanding units of foot 
soldiers. You send your army commanders through 
the world map to capture enemy castles. Once all 
the castles are captured, a new construction 
appears on the map, where the level boss resides, 
and your final goal in the chapter (tale) is to 
defeat this boss. Once you run into an enemy, an 
automatic battle sequence occurs, which you can 
interrupt, assigning commands to your army. Both 
Hanjuku and Kanjuku armies can summon powerful 
creatures called Egg Monsters, who can fight 
against a whole army or against each other in 
turn-based combat. Each month a "monthly event" 
occurs, such as changes in the land, earthquake, 
etc. Random events also pop out, during which you 
can buy supplies for your army.

Haou Taikei - Ryuu Knight (c) Dec 22, 1994 Bandai 
Co., Ltd. / Bandai Co., Ltd. 
 
"Ryu Knight" is based on an animé series of the 
same name. The story of the game is simple: you 
are Adyu, an apprentice knight who spends all his 
time training. One day, a mysterious old man 
appears out of nowhere, approaches Adyu and tells 
him the world needs more paladins, and therefore 
you must train harder in order to become one. He 
sends you on a quest to find a legendary weapon, 
which is broken into twelve parts, each part being 
hidden in a different place. He also entrusts you 
with the power of Ryu, a huge magical armor that 
grants the hero who equips it immense power. This 
is where Adyu's journey begins! 
 
The game is an action RPG, somewhat similar to  Ys 
series. Adyu wanders through the world and fights 
enemies in real-time combat, using melee weapons. 
He can also jump to avoid enemy attacks. You gain 
experience after defeating monsters and advance in 
levels. You can summon the armor Ryu at any time, 
which makes you much stronger, but you can't go 
through narrow corridors and climb up stairs when 
in Ryu form. The game features mostly open areas 
populated by enemies with an occasional town 
thrown in. The structure of the game is 
non-linear: you can visit almost any area of the 
map at any time.

Hat Trick Hero 2 is the follow up to Hat Trick 
Hero, and it is loosely based on the arcade game 
Hat Trick Hero '93. One or two players can play in 
a exhibition game (one single match) or in a world 
league. The game scrolls horizontally uses mode 7 
graphics to give the playing field some 
perspective. 
 
There are 18 countries to select from, each with 
different running, kicking and technical 
abilities. You can use 5 different formations, 
which are 4-4-2, 4-3-3, 3-5-2, WM and libero. You 
also select a team captain from 8 different 
characters. 
 
You can perform a foul tackle on the opponent, but 
when the referee is close enough to notice it you 
risk getting a yellow or red card. By holding down 
a direction after shooting the players can shoot 
the ball with curve effect. During the game a 
power-up bar is charged which can be used for 
special abilities. Holding down R allows you to

Head-On Soccer (c) Sep, 1995 U.S. Gold Ltd. / U.S. 
Gold Ltd. 
 
In this isometric football game, 50 national teams 
are represented to play in two game modes: 
Exhibition and Tournament (a series of seven games 
on four continents, with a final against the World 
All-Stars), with the ability to set time, 
difficulty level, see cutscenes after goals and if 
players are free to kick each other around without 
(many) fouls. 
 
While the game seems short-featured for 1995 
standards, the tournament mode includes a twist: 
depending on how well the player defeats his 
opponents, he can trade his "standard players", 
who won't do anything spectacular (but at least 
fill up the ranks) for star players, who not only 
look different, are able to cross and backheel the 
ball but also have a unique ability at the 
disposal of the player: 
 
1. The Marker: can latch on an opposing player, 
   stopping him from running away with the ball

In this third installment of The Glory of Hercules 
series, you once again visit the world of ancient 
Greek mythology. Cast into the role of a young boy 
from a remote village, you live a peaceful life 
until one day the pigs in your village go crazy, 
and as a result you are thrown underground, only 
to be saved by mysterious fairies. Something goes 
wrong, and the world as you knew it doesn't exist 
any more. You must establish contact to the great 
gods and other famous characters from the Greek 
mythology in order to restore the balance. 
 
Like the previous games of the series, this is a 
standard console-style RPG with turn-based combat 
viewed from first-person perspective. There is a 
day/night cycle, which influences not only the 
appearance of the world map and the towns, but 
also the schedules of the world's inhabitants.

Hit the Ice (c) 1993 Taito Corporation / Taito 
America Corporation 
 
Hit the Ice is a fast-paced, high-impact hockey 
game based on the 1990 arcade game from Williams. 
Having more in common with Midway's Arch Rivals 
than any sane hockey simulation, this arena is no 
place for penalties, and no place for wimps. While 
the idea is still to somehow put the puck into the 
opposing team's goal, each team only has three 
players, there is a heavy focus on checking, and 
it is possible to do a "super shot" which is 
strong enough to send the goalie into the net 
along with the puck. 
 
Available are exhibition and tournament modes for 
one or two players. Two players can even team up 
to take on the computer. The TurboGrafx-16 release 
also adds a four-player mode, while the Gameboy 
version adds a "shot race" mode where the player 
must get a certain number of goals as quickly as 
possible.

The three RPGs (Hokuto no Ken 3-5) seemed to 
symbolize a genre change after the first two 
platformers, but the series changes the genre once 
again in the sixth installment, which is a 
fighting game similar to  Street Fighter II or  
Mortal Kombat. The background story is based on 
the manga/animé of the same name. The years is 
199X, and the world lies in ruins. Technology can 
no longer be used, and the land is controlled by 
fighters of rivaling styles. In this game, you can 
choose one of the fighter characters of the 
series: the main hero Kenshiro, his brother and 
rival Raou, Nanto Seiken fighters Rei and Souther, 
the assassin Heart, and others. You fight 
one-on-one, filling an energy bar and performing 
various attacks and techniques. There is a free 
fight mode where you choose your opponent 
yourself, and a two-player mode.

mode, and free fight mode. 
 
1. In story mode, the player fights as 
   Kenshirou in pre-determined battles that 
   reflect the story of the series (like facing 
   the assassin Heart). 
In battle mode, the player participates in a 
tournament by choosing one of the characters. 
In free fight mode, the player choses characters 
as well as the opponents. During battles, the 
player must first accumulate energy in order to 
unleash devastating techniques unique to each 
character.

Holy Umbrella - Dondera no Mubo!! (c) Sep 29, 1995 
Earthly Soft / Naxat Soft 
 
In "Holy Umbrella", you control a schoolboy who 
lives in modern-day Japan. One day, the sky 
suddenly turns dark blue, a heavy rain falls onto 
the city, and the boy finds, halfway between his 
house and the school, an umbrella which seems to 
have fallen from the sky. What he does not know is 
that the umbrella is magical! The moment he 
touches it, he is transfered to a parallel 
universe. Immediately, he is attacked by a huge 
tank, but a strange old man with a talking bird 
saves him. It seems that an evil creature named 
Dondera is threatening the country with the 
terrible monsters she created. But is it really 
so? You visit the capital town, talk to the 
emperor, and decide to investigate the matter... 
 
"Holy Umbrella" is essentially a platform action 
game, but unlike most other games of this genre, 
it allows you to visit towns, where you control 
your hero in a standard RPG-like top-down fashion. 
You can enter houses, talk to townspeople, etc. On 
platform levels, which are the main part of the 
game, you have to switch between the hero, the 
talking bird Bonto who accompanies you on your 
quest, and the girl Saki, whom you meet later in 
the game. Every character has his/her own special 
abilities and own ways of fighting: the hero can 
slide through air by using the umbrella, Bonto can 
double-jump on high ledges, Saki can jump on 
walls, etc. You use your umbrella as a weapon, as 
well as elemental stones you can collect on your 
way and throw at enemies. You also find various 
power-ups and items you can equip on the hero.

war machine has been named the Red October. While 
on its trial run, the captain, Marko Ramius has

such a weapon must not be allowed to fall into 
American plans, and so orders are issued among the 
Soviet forces to destroy the Red October. 
 
You control the Red October during its run for 
freedom. The game plays as an underwater

in any of four directions. The A button fires 
torpedoes horizontally towards the right and the B 
button fires missiles vertically, upwards. 
Additionally, the Caterpillar drive (invisibility)

Featuring in a children's TV cartoon, The 
Hurricanes are the most revered team in the World 
Soccer League. The Gorgons are desperate to beat 
them in a key match - so desperate that they have 
made it hard for the team to even get to the 
stadium. Taking control of one of their star 
players, you must trek through the jungle, mines 
and a temple to get them to the stadium on time. 
 
Soccer Kid seems like a logical game to 
'influence' a license of a show about brilliant 
football players. Arc Developments agreed. The 
gameplay thus has a football used as a weapon 
against encroaching foes. There are ropes to move 
across, precise jumps to time, and traps to avoid. 
 
In The Hurricanes the ball sticks closely to the 
player's foot, even while he is jumping. It is 
only released when purposefully kicked, and 
replaced if it hits something or is lost. It can 
be flicked up while you are off the ground. 
 
The levels move from left to right but on several 
different vertical levels, and there is often more 
than 1 possible path, in a manner similar to 
Global Gladiators. Power-up tokens can be 
collected and traded in. Losing one of your 5 
lives takes you back tot he last restart point - 
losing one of your continues takes you to the 
start of the world.

The Ignition Factor has the player take control of 
one of the most dangerous jobs, a firefighter, as 
they progress through several stages including a 
museum, a mine and a variety of buildings 
including a skyscraper.  Before each mission, the 
player can look at a map and learn of trapped 
victims and dangerous hot spots and choose their 
equipment that include a chemical & electrical 
fire extinguisher, an oxygen tank, a rope and an 
axe among others.  However, the more equipment 
that the player is carrying, they will not be able 
to run or kick, limiting the firefighter to just 
merely walking. 
 
The goal of each mission is the same, traverse the 
building while avoiding fires or extinguishing 
them, save victims and keep from being burned.  
Along the way the fire fighters will encounter 
obstacles that will stop or kill the player 
including collapsing floors and explosive barrels. 
 There are no power-ups to replenish their health 
or fire extinguishers so the player must be

at some points you'll have to collect and to use 
items. The game mainly progresses thanks to 
conversations with various characters you 
encounter in Ihatovo.

You play a crash test dummy, trying to progress 
through levels filled with hazards such as cars 
and fireballs, within the time limits. Contact 
with each of these loses you a limb, and once you 
have none left, contact means game over. Since the 
character isn’t handicapped by missing limbs in 
any way, in practical terms you can think of these 
as hit points  especially as there are 
screwdrivers to pick up which restore one limb.

Stroke play, and Tournament. 
 
The Skins game has players compete for prize money 
on each individual hole. 
 
Match play involves 2 golfers competing to see who 
can win the most holes out of 9 or 18 holes. 
 
Stroke play counts the total number of strokes 
over a course of a golf game. The golfer with the 
least amount of strokes wins. 
 
Tournament mode has golfers competing in either 
one day (18 holes) or two days (36 holes) of golf. 
Scoring is figured out by how many strokes over or 
under par a golfer made to finish a hole. 
 
Gameplay consists of first choosing a golfer type 
of either a power hitter, all-around, technician, 
or magician. Each type has its own proficiencies 
in the drive, power, accuracy, hook, slice, and 
back spin categories. 
 
When on the golf course the player can choose a 
club, their stance, direction of where to hit the 
ball, and the power of the swing. Once that is 
decided, the swing is determined by a meter which 
measures the accuracy of the shot and determines 
whether the ball gets hit straight, hooks, or 
slices.

big end bosses. 
 
The B-movie story is cheesy and does nothing more

introduction sequence: "The peril came from outer 
space. A meteorite entered the earth's atmosphere 
bringing chaos. After observation, the scientists 
found that the meteorite was radioactive and had 
to be destroyed. Unfortunately, terrorists from 
g.h.o.s.t. want the meteorite too. The Iron 
Commando's mission is to retrieve the deadly body 
and avoid genetic mutation." 
 
The player or players walk along the levels 
beating up enemies. On some levels you ride a 
motorcycle or jeep, even a mine kart, and shoot 
your way through hordes of enemies. There are 
several end bosses, some are screen filling like a 
helicopter and a giant robot. 
 
Some enemies will drop food, grenades or weapons 
as you beat them into a bloody pulp. There are 
lots of different Weapons: 9mm guns, shotguns, 
machine guns, knives, baseball bats. The weird 
thing is, enemies that use a sword and even dogs 
will occasionally drop a machine gun or baseball 
bat.

Jelly Boy (c) 1991 Probe Software Ltd. / Ocean

Jelly Boy is a gelatinous humanoid pink blob on a 
mission throughout some strange worlds. He travels 
throughout such landscapes as giant toy factories 
and arctic snowfields during his quest, facing 
down all manner of dangerous enemies and 
obstacles. He can jump and he can  launch a large 
fist from his stomach (he is a blob, after all). 
Further, different levels have special power-ups 
that allow the blob to assume different forms that 
are useful in specific circumstances. These 
include a hot air balloon (for floating up to 
special items), a hammer (for smashing obstructing 
blocks), a submarine (for more effectively 
navigating an undersea bonus level), a skateboard 
(for blazing through a level on a deadline), and a 
pogo stick (for extra high jumping). Not all of 
the power-ups are useful, though. One item turns 
Jelly Boy into a block so that he is unable to 
move for several seconds. 
 
Jelly Boy collects musical notes in lieu of having 
a power meter. Being hit knocks away all of his 
collected notes and if he gets hit again without 
having any notes, he will lose a life. Jelly Boy 
also collects a variety of fruit throughout his 
quest. Accumulate enough fruit to earn extra 
lives. Certain types of fruit have other side 
effects (orange = more time on the clock, avocado 
= invincibility).

tells him that Zora, the leader of SPREE ("Space 
Pirates Revelling in Evil Enterprises"), is 
planning on looting this solar system of all its 
resource! Unfortunately, in his last encounter 
with Zora, Zoom has used up all his strength and 
now he is powerless so he asks George to take 
over. He gives George his Pneumo Osmatic 
Precipitator (or P.O.P.) and bids him good luck.  
Can George save his family and this galaxy? 
 
Guide George through 9 stages of intergalactic 
action armed with only his wits and the 
P.O.P....which is like a super vacuum. The P.O.P. 
can be used as a traveling tool by sucking onto 
walls and ceilings, it will enable George to climb 
up and across platforms.  As a weapon, the P.O.P. 
can be used to suck up blocks or enemies and spit 
out at other enemies. George can also use the 
P.O.P. to breathe under water! Talk about 
multi-functional! 
 
George's conditions are indicated by the number of 
hearts he has at the top of the screen.  By 
collecting more hearts, it will refill George's 
health. Food items will increase your score and by 
getting a high enough score in each stage, you may 
get to play a bonus game.

Jikkyou Oshaberi Parodius (c) Dec 15, 1995 Konami 
Co., Ltd. / Konami Co., Ltd. 
 
The third in the Paroidus series, it's the same 
gameplay and zaniness that substantiated the first 
two games. Gameplay itself is a copy (a parody 
rather) of Konami's famous Gradius series in that 
the screen scrolls from left to right (most times) 
and you maneuver around the screen destroying 
waves of enemies and avoiding obstacles. Unlike 
previous Parodius titles, this game contains a 
difficulty adjustment option, allowing the player 
to make things easier... or harder. Also unique to 
this parodius title is a bit of japanese digital 
voice that shouts out various things at you while 
you play. Survival throughout the level earns you 
a boss fight, which frequently includes some of 
the strangest characters in the game. Make no 
mistake, this *is* Gradius,  but with all sorts of 
strange graphics, music and references to other 
Konami games... So in other words, it's Parodius! 
 
There are now more power-ups than ever including 
the standard power-up (red, used to upgrade 
weapons), the shield power-up (blue) and a variety 
of different coloured bells. Green Bells will make 
you huge on the screen, Yellow Bells are worth 
points (points in turn are worth extra lives),  
Blue Bells are "big bombs" that clear the screen 
of enemies/shots and can be saved until you need 
them, White Bells will give your character a 
megaphone that will shout out japanese phrases, 
the characters of the phrases themselves can be 
used to damage enemies (the power of words!), The 
Red Bell stockpiles you with three point-defense 
lasers... only one of which can be activated at a 
time and disappear after a short while. Finally 
the purple bell will clear the screen of all but 
the strongest enemies... and will turn them into 
power-ups. 
 
This time around there are 16 different characters 
to chose from and the power-ups and weapons that 
they use are more unique than ever. Several 
familiar "faces" return and they've brought along 
friends to share in the party: 
Vic Viper: The "gradius ship" appears once again 
in this gradius parody, equipped with it's 
traditional gradius weapons 
2. Lord British: The "other" Gradius ship and 
   arguably the more famous of the two. Lord 
   British has weapons similar to Vic but quite 
   different also.Missiles and shields work 
   differently for instance. And Lord British uses 
   a Ripple gun instead of a double shot. 
3. Pentaro: It just wouldn't be a Parodius game 
   if Pentaro wasn't involved. Originally from 
   Konami's Penguin Adventure, Pentaro retains the 
   same abilities from previous Parodius games... 
   however his Potion weapon may now hit multiple 
   enemies and his normal weapon shots explode 
   against obstacles 
4. Hanako: Also from Penguin Adventure, Hanako 
   the penguin is Pentaro's girlfriend. While 
   Pentaro is blue, she is the red penguin. She 
   plays nearly identical to Pentaro with the 
   exception of her S. Bomb weapon 
5. Twinbee: Twinbee, from the Twinbee games is 
   another returning Parodius star. Unfortunately 
   he hasn't been upgraded since previous games, 
   so his weapons are nearly identical

not, you will need to be ready to return your 
opponent's return.  Run back and forth as you try 
to keep hitting the ball over the net until your

Joe & Mac 2 - Lost in the Tropics (c) 1994 Data 
East Corporation / Data East Corporation 
 
This sequel puts you back into the roles of the 
cavemen, Joe and Mac. This time, a caveman named 
Gork has stolen the crown belonging to the Chief 
of Kali Village, and it's up to you to retrieve it 
by using the 7 Rainbow Stones you will collect on 
your journey. 
 
Along the way, you will fight dinosaurs, cavemen, 
and other prehistoric enemies as your travel 
through the jungle, or through the ice and snow, 
or even through a volcanic wasteland. Along the 
way, you can pick up upgrades for your club, or 
pick up projectiles from eating certain 
health-recovery items. In some levels, you'll ride 
in a stone cart, trying to hope over gaps and 
avoid enemies as you try to reach the end. 
 
Improving on the original's platformer/brawler 
co-op gameplay, this game adds adventure and 
role-playing game elements that create a more 
involving experience compared to the first game. 
You can now collect coins in the levels to 
purchase items from Tiki Village, such as meat to 
recover your health, or even remodel your hut back 
at your home village. The game also uses a 
password system to track your progress. The game 
also shifts to an overhead map so you can wander 
to whichever level you wish, and return to 
completed levels to earn more money or power-ups.

One of the earliest titles based on the animé 
series Jojo's Bizarre Adventures, this game is not 
a pure fighter, like Capcom's more known title, 
but an adventure/RPG hybrid with turn-based 
fights. 
 
In a futuristic world, there lives a young man 
named Jojo who holds a terrible power within: the 
power to drain life from enemies. This power is 
somehow connected to the evil vampire Dio who is 
terrorizing the world. Jojo must find faithful 
companions on his quest to restore peace and to 
master the power within himself. 
 
In this game, you navigate Jojo in an 
adventure-like fashion, viewing the hero from 
third-person perspective. You can call up a menu 
at any time to choose a command such as "Look", 
"Talk", etc. Being a Japanese adventure, the game 
doesn't contain puzzles. from time to time, you'll 
be attacked by enemies and will fight them in 
turn-based combat viewed from first-person 
perspective. Jojo and his party members possess 
the so-called "stands", super-powerful creatures 
you summon during fights. before each fight, 
you'll have to choose one of fice available tarot 
cards to determine the amount of luck and 
compatibility of the stands you'll have in the 
game.

add some unique twists such as wounding enemies so 
that they surrender and can be arrested. 
 
The initial levels follow the plot of the movie

to the Aspen penal colony from which he must 
escape and prove his innocence.  Following the 
fight at the top of the Statue of Liberty that 
ended the film, the game continues on with levels

Jurassic Park (c) Nov, 1993 Ocean Software Ltd. / 
Ocean of America, Inc. 
 
The SNES game based on the film Jurassic Park is 
an action title that combines top-down and 
first-person perspectives. 
 
Playing as Dr. Alan Grant, the player's ultimate 
goal is to escape the Jurassic Park island. To 
reach that goal, several other tasks must be 
completed, including restoring power to the park 
and destroying a Velociraptor nest. 
 
The large game world is seen from a top-down view 
and can be freely explored. Some areas are not 
accessible from the beginning, however. To enter 
them, keycards must be found or some special goal 
be completed, like rebooting the computer system 
and using it to open certain gates. Dr. Grant can 
defend himself against the many free-roaming 
dinosaurs with a variety of weapons, including an 
electroshock gun, a shotgun, rocket launcher, gas 
grenade launcher and bola gun. All weapons except 
the electro gun require ammo to work. A radar at 
the bottom of the screen helps in detecting 
approaching dinosaurs, but will only work once the 
park's motion detectors have been activated. 
 
Upon entering one of the park's buildings, the 
game view switches to a scrolling first person 
perspective, reminiscent of early first person 
shooters like Wolfenstein 3D. Just like outside, 
dinosaurs lurk in the corridors, and the same guns 
as in the overworld map can be used to destroy 
them. Many buildings consist of several floors, 
with elevators connecting them. Some rooms are 
pitch black and can only be entered when in 
possession of night vision goggles. 
 
The game supports the SNES mouse for the 
first-person sections and the computer system 
interface.

Kablooey (c) Aug, 1992 
 
Little Bombuzal has to blow up bombs on little 
islands in this puzzle game. In order to advance 
to the next level, all bombs need to detonate. 
There are various sizes of bombs. Bigger ones have 
such a huge blast radius that Bombuzal cannot 
trigger them directly - instead, he has to explode 
smaller bombs first and cause a chain reaction. So 
as one might imagine, later levels turn into loud 
blastfests that need to be carefully planned. 
 
Besides, later levels introduce all kinds of 
additional hazards and gimmicks, like ice floors, 
movable bombs, disappearing ground tiles, and much 
more. Nobody said being a pyromaniac is easy.

Kawasaki Superbike Challenge is a motorcycle 
racing game that uses the same engine as F1. It 
includes 14 standard-length race tracks, plus the 
Suzuka 8 Hours endurance race, available in both 
training and Championship modes. The game is 
unlicensed (except by Kawasaki), so all riders and 
teams are fictional. 
 
The game now has more polygonal roadside objects 
than F1, and there is still a Turbo mode, allowing 
for faster racing at the expense of some of the 
detail. You have the ability to turn on or off 
weather (during rainy days the graphics are darker 
and the bike has less traction). The number of 
laps on each course can be 5, 10 or 15, and there 
are 4 skill levels. Some changes have been made to 
how the vehicle handles, to emphasize the switch 
from cars to bikes.

from a top-down viewpoint and maneuver it around 
the area of the crime. Finally, there's the combat

each city, you go head-to-head with the boss 
creature. There are small stages in between where 
you fight a second monster for bonus points, or 
you fall from the sky and land underwater where 
you try to collect points and power-ups while 
falling.

relevant characters of the aforementioned saga, 
including the enemies of Kinnikuman. Combats will 
be 1 vs 1 and you will be able to execute a 
repertory of man to man acrobatic tactics, and of 
course, all combats will end either with a

Kirby no Kirakira Kids (c) Feb 01, 1998 HAL 
Laboratory, Inc. / Nintendo Co., Ltd. 
 
Kirby's Star Stacker is a Tetris-like puzzle game. 
 There are varying modes of play, such as Time 
Trial, Challenge and Story Mode, but the basic 
idea of play is the same: you must sandwich Star 
Blocks between two like Friend Blocks, either 
horizontally or vertically.  The Friend Blocks and 
any Star Blocks in-between are then removed from 
play.  Similar to Tetris, sets of blocks fall into 
the bin that contain any two of the following 
types: 
 
Star Blocks: The most important block, as all of 
the game types rely on it. Sandwich these blocks 
between two Friend Blocks either horizontally or 
vertically, and they will be cleared.  The more 
stars you clear, the higher the score. 
 
Friend Blocks: These blocks have pictures of 
Kirby's friends - Rick the Hamster, Kine the Fish, 
and Coo the Owl (all from Kirby's Dream Land 2) - 
on them. Match two of each to clear them from the 
screen.  Any Star Blocks between the two character 
blocks will also be cleared. 
 
Bomb Blocks: Sandwich a Bomb Block in between two 
Friend Blocks, and the bomb will explode, removing 
all blocks in the same row. 
 
Hard Blocks: You have to clear these blocks twice 
to clear them from the screen. Clear them once and 
they transform into an ordinary Star Block, and 
then can be removed in the normal way. 
 
The game also features a clever 'chain' system 
that rewards you for clearing blocks which then 
clear other blocks.  If you clear two or more 
blocks in this manner, then you'll be rewarded 
with Kirby raining down that amount of Stars, 
which can fill in gaps, which in turn could 
complete a row and allow it to chain even further!

Kirby Super Star (c) Sep 08, 1996 HAL Laboratory, 
Inc. / Nintendo of America Inc. 
 
"Kirby Super Star" is another platformer in the 
Kirby series, distinguished for having an 
unusually versatile character, who can fly and 
gain the abilities of his foes. 
 
The game is actually a set of seven main games: 
Spring Breeze, Dynablade, Gourmet Race, The Great 
Cave Offensive are unlocked at first, and later 
Metaknight's Revenge, Milky Way Wishes and The 
Arena become available, as well as a couple of 
minor minigames. 
 
These are all typical Kirby platformers, each one 
with its own set of levels and different gameplay. 
In most of them you can consume monsters and learn 
their special abilities, but in Milky Way Wishes 
abilities are instead collected in a manner 
similar to Metroid. Offensive Cave features levels 
with various obstacles, hidden treasures and some 
elementary lever-pulling kind of puzzle solving. 
Metaknight's Revenge is the only game on the 
cartridge with a (fairly strict) timer.  The Arena 
is a "boss rush" mode, asking players to defeat 
every boss in the game with limited health refills 
and on one life. 
 
Kirby Super Star is best known for its two-player 
cooperative play option, which has given it a 
reputation as a party game.

The First Annual Dream Land's Avalanche 
Competition is about to get under way, and as 
Kirby and a host of characters from the Kirby 
series, you can join the tournament and become 
Avalanche king. 
 
Avalanche is similar to Puyo Puyo, and has you 
stacking colored blobs similar in a way to Tetris. 
When a certain amount of one color is stacked, an 
explosion occurs and the screen clears of those 
blobs, which then appear in the other players 
screen (either the CPU or a second player). When 
your screen is cleared before the other player, 
you move onto the next round, and so on until the 
final boss. The winner of that match is then 
crowned the Avalanche king.

Kirby's Dream Course is an innovative SNES game 
featuring everyone's favourite pink blob, Kirby. 
After his adventures in Dream Land we find him in 
this mini golf game where Kirby himself is the 
ball, and you must guide him around each hole 
using the sort of bar system that you see in most 
golf games. Where this game differs, however, is 
in the fact that you need to eliminate all 
on-screen enemies before you can guide Kirby into 
the hole and complete it. As per usual in golf 
games, the more strokes it takes you to complete 
the whole, the lower your score - so make sure you 
aim Kirby just right! 
 
You'll find eight courses and a total of 
sixty-four holes in the game, not including the 
final showdown with King Dedede, as well as an 
action-packed two-player mode.

Kishin Douji Zenki - Batoru Raiden (c) Aug 04, 
1995 
 
Once already Chiaki and her reluctant demon 
servant Zenki have saved the world from the forces 
of darkness, but apparently once is never enough. 
Chiaki has a vision of five cloaked figures and 
knows that only she and Zenki can stop them. At 
once they set off to track down the demon leaders. 
 
In Kishin Douji ZENKI: Battle Raiden the player 
takes the role of Zenki. At first, and 
occasionally through the game, Zenki will be in 
his powered down form where he can only punch, 
jump, and dash. After Chiaki recovers her 
bracelet, or regains her concentration, or 
whatever she needs to do at the time, she can 
transform Zenki into his powered up form. In this 
form Zenki deals more damage and has a much longer 
list of attacks that get added to as the game 
progresses, such as a pillar of energy, an 
electrified punch, and a dashing attack. By 
picking up scrolls Zenki can do a powerful Rudora 
attack to all enemies on screen, but this attack 
damages Zenki as well. 
 
To complete platforming levels Zenki will have to 
make it to the end of the level while occasionally 
finding hidden stone monuments that, when 
destroyed, will drop items as well as alter the 
level or remove obstacles, allowing Zenki to pass. 
After a stage's first platforming level is a 
midboss fight, and after the second platforming 
level is the boss fight proper.

Capcom U.S.A., Inc. 
 
In Knights of the Round, play the role of one of 
three knights from the Arthurian legends. The 
three characters are Sir Lancelot, Sir Percival, 
and of course King Arthur. 
 
The story tells of a man who pulled the mighty 
sword Excalibur from a rock which no one else 
could achieve. This feat signified that he should 
be king of the Britons and lead them to peace. The 
trouble is there is mass chaos in the land and the 
only way Arthur can stop it is to find the holy 
grail which has been hidden for over a thousand 
years. Aurthur is joined by Percival and Lancelot 
on his quest to find the grail. 
 
The gameplay involves the player to scroll along 
the screen fighting of enemies with a sword or axe 
depending on the character. The player can also 
block and parry with opponents which is done by a 
simple button press. There are also character 
development elements in the game where collecting 
points by killing enemies and picking up gold 
increase the character's attack and speed.  
Character's armour and weapons also change when 
they gain experience.

Kouryuu Densetsu Villgust - Kieta Shoujo (c) May 
23, 1992 Plex / Bandai Co., Ltd. 
 
This game is based on the animé series Villgust. 
The main hero of the game is Shun, a teenager who 
lives in modern-day Japan. One day, when he was 
going back from school with his girlfriend 
Michiko, Shun noticed a strange red-eyed rabbit. 
When he tried to follow him, Shun suddenly found 
himself all alone in a forest clearing. He was 
immediately approached by a group of four 
adventurers who said they were members of a group 
called R.A.G.E. (Resistance Against God of Evil). 
Apparently, Shun was transported into a parallel 
medieval world, and an evil organization known as 
Vile was the one behind Michiko's kidnapping. Shun 
and his friends will now do anything to help 
Michiko and to destroy Vile! 
 
This is a traditional console-style RPG. You 
travel on the world map, visit towns, buy 
equipment and items, descend into dungeons, and 
fight random enemies in turn-based combat viewed 
from a third-person "over-the-shoulder" 
perspective. The party can hold up to five 
characters. The characters level up in a standard 
way, and also get experience and new levels for 
their magical spells.

Kunio-kun no Dodge Ball - Zenin Shuugou! (c) 1993 
Technos Japan Corp. / Technos Japan Corp. 
 
16-bit sequel to the cult-classic Super Dodge 
   Ball which unfortunately only saw a Japanese 
   release. 
 
The game continues the "Worldwide Dodge Ball 
tournament" motif of the original in which several 
teams from around the world compete in side 
scrolling dodge ball matches to see which one is 
the best. Gameplay is similar to other sport games 
in which you control the character that has the 
ball at the time (although a lead character always 
marks the formations and generally controls the 
team), and special moves can be executed to try 
and eliminate your opponents (such as homing 
throws and other esoteric moves). 
 
This sequel also adds more comprehensive 
tournament mechanics, for instance your 
performance in each match allows you to buy 
power-ups and special moves to enhance your 
players, you can also create a custom team and 
manage them throughout the tournament by adding or 
removing members as you see fit (you can even try 
to lure players from opposing teams). You can also 
choose among a series of formations and AI 
profiles in case you play alone, although you can 
use a multi-tap to play with up to 4 players. 
 
Available game modes include Tournament, Vs and 
Mechabutsuke mode which is a variation on Vs that 
involves a free-roaming court and no outfielders.

Lady is a girl from a good family. So, is she a 
good girl? Well, not really... she doesn't care 
much for good manners and diligent study, but 
thinks only about faraway lands and treasure. 
Wherever she appears, destruction follows... 
Lady's parents, afraid of their daughter's 
hyperactive nature, locked her in a mansion 
guarded by two loyal servants: the gardener Yoshio 
and the cook Cocks (yes, that's the name!). One 
day, Lady finds a book about Deathland Island, 
where supposedly a great treasure is hidden. She 
escapes the mansion, arrives at Deathland Island, 
and learns its was once ruled by a mad scientist 
King Baron, who made experiments on monsters. Lady 
decides to explore Baron's castle and the rest of 
the island, to find a way to get to the legendary 
treasure. 
 
"Lady Stalker" is an isometric action RPG, closely 
connected to the more known game  Landstalker for 
Sega Genesis. You explore dungeons and other 
locations, most of which are full of various 
puzzles. You can't jump, but you can dash (jumping 
over small pits) instead. The regular battles are 
random. Once you enter a battle, you control Lady 
in real-time, but later in the game, other 
characters join the party. Those characters are 
controlled by the AI, but you can pause the battle 
at any time and assign commands to them.

France SA / Titus France SA 
 
Starting out with just a basic Lamborghini and 
$6000, your aim is to rise to the top of the 4 
divisions of racing through success on 60 
racetracks across America. In each division there 
are 20 rival racers, up to 3 of which compete in 
each race at a time. 
 
The races also feature lots of local drivers (who 
can take crucial positions away from you and the 
other championship drivers), Sunday drivers going 
at normal speed, and police. before each race you 
will be told of the quality of the locals and the 
likelihood of police presence. 
 
When police are in the area, speeding beyond 110 
Km/h could see you branded as an offender, at 
which point the police will try to ram you off the 
road, Chase H.Q.-style. You can attempt to reach 
the end of the race despite this damage (which 
eventually hampers your speed), or simply pull 
over and accept a fine and the loss of race 
points. If the police subsequently stop you, the 
fine is heavier. 
 
Each race costs money to enter, and your earnings 
can be boosted by betting on the results with the 
other championship drivers. If one of you wins, 
each driver gives you either the amount they bet 
or the amount you bet, whichever is lower

Last Battle, The (c) Feb 12, 1994 Powwow / Techiko 
 
"The Last Battle" for SNES is a RPG in which you 
control Kurt, a young apprentice magician who 
lives in Eldar village with his parents. He just 
turned sixteen, and on the day of his initiation 
he receives a task from the Great Magician 
Fehbennels: he has to go to a nearby cave and to 
retrieve a precious gem. When Kurt returns home, 
he meets an injured soldier from the Silver 
Castle. He says the castle was attacked by the 
army of the evil warlock Glud. The Great Magician 
Fehbennels sends Kurt to king Gustaf and the ruler 
of the Silver Castle, Lord Yuri. Kurt gets 
involved in a conflict between different nations, 
and meets the elven girl Mei and other companions 
on his quest to defeat the ultimate evil. 
 
The game is a Japanese-style RPG: you navigate 
Kurt and his party on the world map, visiting 
towns, descending into dungeons, and fighting 
random enemies and bosses. The battles are set in 
auto-mode and are a mixture of turn-based and real 
time styles. You can stop the flow of a battle by 
accessing a menu and assigning commands to your 
characters. The battles are viewed from a 
third-person perspective, and the characters move 
around the battle field automatically while 
performing their attacks. The characters can use 
physical attacks and a variety of offensive and 
defensive magic.

Last Bible III (c) Mar 04, 1995 Multimedia 
Intelligence Transfer Co., Ltd. / Atlus Co., Ltd. 
 
"Last Bible III" is a sequel to two Last Bible 
games for GameBoy and GameBoy Color. You control 
Shieru, a young boy who lives in a small village 
on a planet with a medieval civilization. With the 
help of his friends, he should fulfill an ancient 
prophecy and defeat the evil that threatens the 
planet. In order to do that, the heroes of the 
game have to recruit demons who will help them in 
battles. 
 
As a part of Megaten universe, "Last Bible III" is 
focused on demon summoning and fusion. The concept 
is more developed in this game, since demons are 
now fully customizable characters that can level 
up and be equipped just like human party members. 
Unlike most Megaten games, "Last Bible III" is set 
in a medieval environment and has a more 
traditional flair. The battles are viewed from 
first person perspective in a standard Megaten 
fashion, but movement on the world map, in towns 
and in dungeons is controlled from third person 
perspective with a top-down view.

Lawnmower Man, The (c) 1993 Sales Curve Ltd., The 
/ THQ Inc. 
 
The Lawnmower Man is the game based on the 1992 
movie of the same name (itself loosely based on a 
Stephen King short story)  starring pre-Bond fame 
Pierce Brosnan as Dr. Lawrence Angelo, a scientist 
working for Virtual Space Industries in "Project 
5", a secret research that attempts to increase 
the intelligence of primates using psychotropic 
drugs and VR training. 
 
With his reluctance to aim the research to 
military purpose, after one of the chimps escapes 
and shoots a guard in the process he is given a 
forced vacation, and while taking notes on the 
need for experiment with a human subject, he 
notices Jobe Smith (Jeff Fahey), a simpleton who 
makes his living on odd jobs such as mowing the 
grass (hence, the title role). The first 
experiments quickly increase Jobe's intelligence, 
and while after an accident Angelo stopped the 
experiments, The Shop, a secret agency overviewing 
Project 5, reinserted the drugs responsible for 
violent behaviour into the program and sped up the 
treatment. As Jobe starts to develop telekinetic 
powers, he starts to take revenge on those who 
abused him before he started the treatments, and 
plots to take over all computers in the world. 
 
While the CD version of the game (PC, Mega CD) is 
an interactive movie, both cartridge versions are 
platformers, the player taking control of Dr. 
Angelo or Carla Parkette (mother of Jobe's best 
friend) in typical side-scrolling shooting action. 
The player can collect better weapons or data 
discs, which after collecting a number of them 
allow to morph into the Virtual Suit, which gives 
protection against a first hit. The player visits 
several locations seen in the movie, such as the 
gas pump and the VSI headquarters. 
 
The twists of the game are true-3D level 
connectors, based on the CG sequences of the 
movie, usually all involving avoiding obstacles 
(and the occasional shooting) at high speed in the 
VR world. There are four different (Virtual World, 
Cyber War, Cyber Run and Cyber Tube), each taking 
a slightly different approach (Virtual World is 
seen in first person, the objective being dodging 
obstacles such as trees and archs and reach the 
exit, Cyber War similar to Virtual World but with 
some shooting stops, Cyber Run is seen in third 
person and requires occasional shooting of 
obstacles, while Cyber Tube is a fast travel with 
plenty of enemies in a VR tunnel).

Legend is a side-scrolling Beat' em Up set in a 
fantasy world. You have to rid the kingdom of 
Sellech of the king's evil son Clovius, who wants 
to conquer the kingdom by harnessing the power of 
the imprisoned soul of Beldor, who once ruled over 
Sellech as a despot. 
 
To complete your quest, you must fight your way 
through numerous enemies using different 
combinations of slashes and kicks. You cannot 
perform any throws, but there are different magic 
attacks and a special attack. The special attack 
is a ranged attack that consumes a certain amount 
of energy, whereas the different spells use up 
magic bags that can be found throughout the game 
and damage every enemy on screen. Defeated enemies 
drop different kinds of items such as magic bags , 
food to replenish your health, money and keys that 
are used to open treasure chests in some of the 
bonus-games that take place in-between battles. 
Naturally, at the end of each stage, a powerful 
boss is waiting to be defeated.

Legend of Zelda, The - A Link to the Past (c) Apr 
01, 1992 Nintendo EAD / Nintendo of America Inc. 
 
Recently, famine and drought have plagued Hyrule.  
When all seemed lost, a mysterious wizard, 
Agahnim, appeared, and stopped these strange 
happenings from occurring.  But there is talk that 
Agahnim now rules the country with his magic, 
behind the scenes.  And then, one night, the 
Princess of Hyrule, Zelda, calls out for 
help...and the one who hears her pleas is a young 
lad named Link... 
 
The Legend of Zelda: A Link to the Past is a 
top-down action adventure game (similar to the 
original Legend of Zelda) for the Super Nintendo 
and Game Boy Advance.  Players assume the role of 
Link, and their goal is to rescue Princess Zelda 
and save the land of Hyrule.  Unlike turn-based 
RPGs, all combat in Link to the Past is in 
real-time - you swing your sword at enemies by 
pressing a button, or can spin the sword around 
you for a more powerful attack by holding down the 
button until it is charged. 
 
Progression through the game is done by conquering 
a series of dungeons - each dungeon has its own 
special item associated with it, such as the 
hookshot (which latches onto a far-off object and 
pulls Link across) or the hammer (which can be 
used to flatten objects in your way).  Most of 
these dungeons are rendered impassable until the 
dungeon's particular item is acquired

of functions which can be assigned to a Lemming, 
including climbing, floating and bashing. You must 
click to select the appropriate function, then 
click on the Lemming to activate it. Each level 
has a different range of skills on offer, a 
different amount of Lemmings, and a different 
percentage target in order to progress.

Lemmings 2 - The Tribes (c) 1995 DMA Design 
Limited / Psygnosis Limited 
 
The sequel to one of the most famous games ever 
now has a much more significant plot. The Lemmings 
have split into 12 distinct tribes, each of which 
has their own landscape and their own cultural 
identity - they include Egyptian, Circus and 
Highland. However, Lemming Island is now in 
danger, and you must complete 10 levels for each 
tribe in order for them to reunite and reassemble 
the Talisman from the 12 pieces. 
 
Across the 120 levels there are over 60 skills, 
although no more than 10 are in use on each 
screen. The Classic tribe has the ones form the 
original and is perhaps the best option for 
first-time players. 
 
The others range from digging methods such as a 
scooper (diagonally downwards) and club basher 
(horizontal), building skills such as a planter 
(takes time to produce the desired raise to the 
landscape) and a sand pourer, and various methods 
of movement including a Pole-Vaulter and a Skater 
(the only Lemmings who can cross ice). Some of 
these are only subtly different to others, and 
their exact uses are unclear, but there are 4 
Trainer levels where you can select any 
combination of skills and experiment. 
 
Unlike the first game, you are rewarded for saving 
as many Lemmings as possible, rather than simply 
passing or failing. The ultimate aim is to save 
all 60 Lemmings through all levels, thereby 
earning a Gold Medal for that tribe - Silver and 
Bronze are also on offer. You can also go back 
over levels in the hope of saving more Lems. 
 
Because there are 12 tribes, and you can switch 
between them at any point, you have to be stuck 12 
times in order to be unable to progress. The game 
saves your progress rather than using passwords as 
in the first game.

Lennus II - Fuuin no Shito (c) Jul 26, 1996 Asmik 
Ace Entertainment, Inc. / Asmik Ace Entertainment, 
Inc. 
 
This is a follow-up to the game "Lennus", which is 
know outside of Japan as  Paladin's Quest. The 
game is set in a world of Andell - a floating 
continent where ancient prophecies and highly 
advanced technology co-exist. A curse has fallen 
onto Andell - its four island, once united, are 
now separated, and are floating away from the 
heart of the continent, the temple of Andell. The 
sages of the temple summon a great hero named 
Farse, who must find a special magic orb for each 
one of the islands, which is the only way to 
re-unite them. Farse embarks on his journey, aided 
by three Terranos, the big-eared inhabitants of 
Andell. 
 
This is a console-style RPG where you control a 
party containing the main hero Farse and three 
Terranos you select out of the available five. You 
encounter random enemies and bosses and fight them 
in turn-based combat viewed from first-person 
perspective. You can use special attacks and 
magical spells, which don't consume magic points, 
but take away a certain amount of your hit points. 
Instead of healing items, you have mini-bottles 
you can refill with potions in special places in 
towns. You can equip various magical artifacts 
which will allow you to use magic spells belonging 
to eight different elements.

One day Lester was walking through Seaport City's 
loading docks reading the new issue of his 
favorite comic, "Super Duper Hero Squad."  Feeling 
a little tired from playing video games late the 
night before, he looked around for a comfortable 
place to finish his comic. 
 
Without thinking, Lester stretched out on a pallet 
that was ready for loading onto a nearby 
freighter.  And fell asleep. 
 
Boy, did he pick a bad place to take  a nap.  
Several hours out of port he woke up and found 
himself in deep trouble (and more than a little 
seasick).  The ship's captain believed his story 
about being an accidental stowaway.  But... only 
in cases of extreme medical emergency could the 
ship return to port.  And Lester wasn't that 
seasick.  Yet... 
 
So, he was along for the ride...  until the first 
port of call.  But as chance would have it, 
pirates hijacked and scuttled the freighter.  
Luckily enough, Lester found a life vest before 
the ship sank and swam for the nearest tropical 
island. 
 
Just before reaching the beach Lester passed out 
from sheer exhaustion.  Now, his real adventure 
begins... 
 
It is up to you to help Lester get back home. 
 
You'll face such things as giant seagulls, 
panthers, pirates, and the spirits of the 
underworld.

Liberty or Death (c) 1994 KOEI Co., Ltd. / KOEI 
Corporation 
 
STORY 
The European Wars against Spain and France have 
been costly to the British Empire. In order to 
gain additional funds for the war effort, the 
Crown raise taxes from the New World colonies 
without representation. This act compels the New 
World colonies to protest and boycott against 
British rule. By 1775, the Crown alarmed by the 
protests, boycotts and politically instability in 
the New World sends troops to subdue any 
rebellious efforts by the New World colonists. 
This threatening approach provokes the Thirteen 
Colonies to revolt. Thus starts the War for 
Independence in the New World (American 
Revolutionary War). 
 
GAMEPLAY 
Choosing Sides 
In Liberty or Death, you partake in the American 
Revolutionary War, either as the "rebels" - the 
American Continental Army or as the "Crown" - the 
British Royal Army. 
 
Choosing either one of the nations will prompt you 
to choose the leading Commander-in-Chief: 
 
The Continental Army: Charles Lee, Artemas Ward or 
George Washington. 
The British Royal Army: Henry Clinton, Thomas Gage 
or William Howe. 
 
Revolutionary Politics 
Each turn you will have to balance your treasury 
for the war effort. Money is provided by each 
state. The more states that support your cause, 
the more money will flow in your coffers. Money is 
spent in paying wages, strengthening the fleet and 
recruiting new regiments. 
 
Here, if you have a sufficient fleet, you can also 
command your Navy officer to "control the seas" 
which is conducting a blockade and privateering 
against enemy ships. This may result in seized 
goods that will be added to your treasury. 
 
The American Revolutionary War in Liberty or Death 
included everyone except the American Indians: [1] 
Revolutionary Militia: American supporters but not 
yet fully supportive of Continental Army (not 
under your full control) [2] Loyalist Militia: 
Militia supportive to the Crown [3] French Army: 
The French will support the American cause after a 
formal alliance is held. [4] Spanish Army: The 
Spaniards will support the American cause after a 
formal alliance is held. 
 
Revolutionary Combat 
The Top-down turned based combat introduces units 
available in the Revolutionary War: Infantry, 
Guerrilla, Cavalry and Artillery (Engineers). 
Combat near shores may also be joined by Naval 
units: Fleet and Fires Ships.

May is an apprentice mage at Magic School and must 
pass the final exam. 
 
A puzzle game seen from a top-down perspective. 
The goal of each level is to open the exit by 
pushing a magic stone on a designated spot. May 
can also push objects one tile ahead without 
moving herself. This is often used to get the 
stone over water that she can't cross herself. 
May's other ability is to create magic bubbles. 
She can create bubbles in three different sizes. 
Bubbles will pop after a certain amount of time, 
depending on their size. If they pop while next to 
the stone or another bubble, the stone or bubble 
will be moved one space. Since May can create 
several bubbles simultaneously, it is possible, 
and often necessary, to create chain reactions to 
maneuver the stone into the desired position. 
 
As the game progresses, levels become increasingly 
difficult and new hazards and enemies are 
introduced. Enemies follow a set movement pattern 
and can sometimes be stopped, but not destroyed by 
magic bubbles. Later levels are made more 
complicated by different types of tiles including: 
grass that slows down May, ice that May and the 
magic stone will slip over, spikes that destroy 
the stone if it is pushed into them, collapsing 
tiles that can only be walked over once, rune 
tiles on which May cannot create magic bubbles, 
teleporters and others.

Live a Live (c) Sep 02, 1994 Square Co., Ltd. / 
Square Co., Ltd. 
 
In "Live a Live", you control seven main 
characters and play through seven different 
stories set in seven different time periods: 
prehistoric age, medieval Europe, feudal Japan, a 
futuristic world with robots and weird machines, 
etc. Those stories appear to have no common 
points, yet after completing all of them, you'll 
see they are in fact connected - the worlds of all 
those characters are threatened by the same 
ultimate evil force. 
 
The combat features many innovations compared to 
traditional console RPGs: your position on the 
battle field is important, and certain techniques 
can be used only from certain positions, and enemy 
attacks also affect only specific parts of the 
field. Out of the seven chapters, some have more 
battle-oriented gameplay, while others are more 
devoted to puzzle-solving and 
information-gathering. 
 
The game is one of the least known Squaresoft 
products, and was never released outside of Japan.

Lode Runner Twin - Justy to Liberty no Daibouken 
(c) 1994 T&E&nbsp / T&E&nbsp 
 
All the king's candy has been stolen by invaders 
who live down in the dungeon. The king summons 
twin heroes: Justy and Liberty to try to get it 
back. 
 
Lode Runner Twin: Justy to Liberty no Daibouken is 
a side-scrolling platform game, adapted for the 
SNES from the original Lode Runner. However the 
atmosphere has changed to a lot more cartoonish 
and happy. Controlling either Justy or Liberty, 
the player is able to move back and forth, climb 
ladders, cross ropes and dig holes in some types 
of surface. The enemies then fall into these holes 
and the player can walk over them. The goal in 
each level is to get all the candy. 
 
There is also a battle mode that puts Justy versus 
Liberty to see who can fetch the most candy.

Lodoss Tou Senki - Record of Lodoss War (c) Dec 
22, 1995 Kadokawa Shoten / Kadokawa Shoten 
 
One of the several video games based on Ryo 
Mizuno's fantasy novels, this version of Record of 
Lodoss War does not follow the main plot of the 
novels, but is instead dedicated to an important 
episode from the history of Lodoss: the battle of 
Six Heroes against the demon god. 
 
The introduction shows the Six Heroes in the 
middle of this confrontation. Flaus, the priestess 
of Valis, is slain in battle. The hero Beld, 
enraged, invokes a demonic power to defeat the 
god. But when the battle is over, the heroes 
disappear... 
 
The game begins with Karla the Grey Witch, one of 
the Six Heroes, alone in a strange place, her 
powers lost. After completing Karla's scenario, 
the player is taken to the scenarios of the other 
heroes, and finally finds out what happened to all 
of them. 
 
Record of Lodoss War is a Japanese-style RPG with 
top-down navigation, world map, and randomly 
appearing enemies. However, the battles have a 
strategic edge, allowing the characters to move on 
the battle field freely. The battles take place on 
an isometric screen. Characters can also acquire 
unique abilities, such as for example Karla's 
ability to possess bodies of other people.

Looney Tunes B-Ball (c) 1994 Sculptured Software, 
Inc. / SunSoft 
 
The Looney Tunes work hard at Warner Bros. studios 
acting in cartoons for all to enjoy. It's tough 
work, and afterwards they just want to relax and 
maybe shoot a few hoops in the parking lot. Of 
course they can't entirely leave their wild antics 
inside the studio, and will certainly bring some 
kind of zany onto the basketball court. 
 
Looney Tunes B-Ball is a 2-on-2 Basketball game, 
similar to the more well known NBA Jam. However, 
Looney Tunes is much more informal and silly, 
though this level of silliness is set by the 
player via the Wackiness Meter on the main menu. 
Players choose their teams from the likes of: Bugs 
Bunny, Daffy Duck, Elmer Fudd, Wile E. Coyote, 
Tasmanian Devil, Sylvester, Yosemite Sam and 
Marvin Martian. Each player has unique statistics 
for their shooting, 3-pointers, defense, stamina 
and speed. 
 
Once on the court, the player can pass the ball, 
shoot the ball, grab a burst of speed or unleash a 
special defensive ability or a special offensive 
ability.. These abilities include cream pies, time 
bombs, sticks of dynamite and other fun toys from 
the ACME Corporation. Offensive Abilities must be 
"bought" by collecting gems and other items which 
occasionally show up on the basketball court.

Three Vikings, Eric the Swift, Olaf the Stout and 
Baleog the Fierce, were kidnapped by the alien 
Tomator, the evil Croutonian ruler, who is 
collecting unique life forms to display in his 
gallery. The three Vikings will have to combine 
their unique skills to defeat Tomator, as well as 
a vast array of aliens, robots, giant snails, big 
lizards and more. 
 
The Lost Vikings is a side-scrolling platform 
puzzle game with a twist. Instead of one character 
who can jump, run, shoot, collect items, flip 
switches and so on, there are three different 
characters, each with his own skills. Eric the 
Swift can jump, run and bash through walls with 
his tough helmet. Olaf the Stout has a shield 
which can block attacks, function as an air glider 
or as a step to stand on. Baleog the Fierce can 
shoot things with his arrows (including switches) 
or kill things with his sword. The player has to 
use the three Vikings as a team if he wants to get 
past the increasingly difficult levels and 
puzzles. 
 
The player controls one Viking at a time, but can 
switch between them at any point. The Vikings have 
limited space in their inventory which they can 
use to keep various items. Each Viking has three 
health points, and if he loses them all from 
confrontations with dangers, he dies (some threats 
kill instantly), and the level must be restarted.

You are a young man who is about to marry his 
sweetheart Yuka. Everything is prepared for the 
ceremony, but at the last moment the church is 
shaken by a mysterious force, and the next thing 
you know is that your bride has disappeared! 
Equipped not only with your best weapon and armor, 
but also with your manly charm, you have to go out 
to the jungle of modern city, to get Yuka back! I 
guess it also won't harm if you get acquainted 
with some pretty ladies on the way, now will it?.. 
 
"Love Quest" is a humorous RPG where traditional 
turn-based, first person perspective combat 
options are replaced by actions you would normally 
do to win a girl's attention: you can for example 
smile, which will cost you MP and inflict big 
"damage" on the girl, and so on. Your only enemies 
are girls (including random encounters), and your 
progress will be determined by your successful 
fighting. Of course, you also level up, acquire 
items, better weapons and armor, just like in any 
"normal" RPG. At certain points girls will also 
join your party, to heal and to support you. 
 
Despite its "suggestive" themes, the game doesn't 
feature any explicit sex scenes or nudity.

The hero Maxim and his group defeat the Sinistrals 
on Mt. Doom (as portrayed in Lufia II), and all is 
peaceful.  With such a great peace, the defense 
forces of the world become lax.  One hundred years 
later attacks begin taking place, supposedly by 
the Sinistrals.  It's up to the descendant of the 
hero, and his childhood friend Lufia, to form a 
new band of champions to save the world. 
Gameplay is fairly standard for RPGs, with 
turn-based battling by way of a menu of icons, and 
random battles.  There's also a higher-than-normal 
emphasis on puzzles within dungeons.

Mountain, she'll be granted one wish. Arle decides 
to search for the gems which are scattered all 
over the world, and to overcome all the obstacles 
with her great magic power! 
 
The game features random enemy encounters and 
turn-based combat, which takes place on a platform 
(Arle to the left, the enemies to the right). You 
can't perform physical attacks at all, and your 
only way of harming enemies is through magic. 
During the game, you learn a variety of magic 
spells, which can be upgraded later. In battles 
you can't see your own and the enemies' hit 
points, and have to act according to your

Magical Taruruuto-kun - Magic Adventure (c) Mar 
28, 1992 Bandai Co., Ltd. / Bandai Co., Ltd. 
 
Magical Taruruuto-kun: Magic Adventure is a Super 
Mario-style platformer based on the anime and 
manga of the same name. In the game Taru must 
cross levels in five worlds to reach and defeat 
Raivar to save Honmaru's girlfriend Iyona. Taru 
can attack enemies in a level with his tongue, and 
he can also eat the many takoyaki scattered 
throughout the level. Takoyaki can also function 
as platforms, though, so they shouldn't all be 
eaten. At the end of a level Taru can use the 
takoyaki he's eaten to purchase temporary power 
ups. On the worldmap taru can run into friends and 
enemies who will challenge Taru to minigames. Win 
and he gains extra takoyaki and powerups.

Magic Sword (c) May 29, 1992 Capcom Co., Ltd. / 
Capcom Co., Ltd. 
 
As the hero, you must climb up a monster-ridden 
tower to defeat Drokkmar, master of the Blackorb. 
To do this, you must defeat his army that stands 
in your way with whatever weapon you are carrying. 
Health is decreased by coming into contact with 
various monsters, attacks, traps, and the passage 
of time. It is increased by finding food. Every 
certain amount of points, a "Food Fairy" appears 
and drops off food as well. 
 
Throughout your journey, you can smash open chests 
to find treasure and artifacts. Some of these 
artifacts can be recovered that alter gameplay, 
such as providing more damage or increased magical 
power. Also throughout your journey, you can 
collect keys, which are used to free imprisoned 
allies, who not only help you defeat monsters, but 
also leave you an item that will help you on your 
quest. Only one person can join you at a time. 
 
As you progress through the tower, you will be 
granted new magical weapons after each boss you 
defeat. The weapons are affected by a "magic bar" 
that charges over time. When this bar is fully 
charged, the weapon has a powerful ranged attack, 
but when not charged only a close attack is 
produced. A magical staff will grant increased 
range attack ability. A magical blast may be 
generated by jumping and attacking, but doing this 
costs health. 
 
There are multiple paths in the game, and two 
separate endings. Hidden doors can be used to skip 
levels when found - usually by attacking a wall or 
a particular spot.

Alex is attacked by four monsters but is saved by 
a Knight of Anatea. Alex, the son of a shepard, 
grows up idolizing this knight and once the proper 
age, wishes to enroll in the Arena tournament, 
though his family forbids him. Entering the 
tournament Alex and two other warriors: Gina the 
Magician and Getz the Mercenary, all are defeated 
in the first round and sent to the Inn to 
recuperate. However during their absence, the 
Demon King plans a surprise attack on the Arena

and given the mission of defeating the Demon King. 
They set out on an epic journey... 
 
Magna Braban: Henreki no Yusha is a console-style 
RPG with party-based combat and random enemy 
encounters. The game's main view is an overhead 
map of a specific location, such as a town, where 
the characters move and can interact with NPCs. 
Upon leaving an area, the view changes to a larger 
overworld map showing locations of interest. The 
battles are viewed from an isometric perspective 
and the characters automatically engage and 
perform their actions. While the player does not 
directly control any of the characters, they can 
pause the battle at time and assign new strategies 
(such as melee, use long-ranged attacks or use 
Magic) to each character. Experience points and 
gold are awarded after each battle, the later of 
which can be used to purchase equipment and items.

Bowser, the token bad guy from the Mario Bros. 
series, is up to no good again in this educational 
game designed to teach children geography. This 
time he's set up his headquarters in Antarctica 
and created portals to 25 famous cities around the 
world, so that his Koopas can wreak havoc in our 
own world. He's also kidnapped Mario, hence the 
title of this game. You play as Luigi who must 
foil Bowser's plans by entering through each of 
the portals, tracking down the Koopas who have 
stolen famous artifacts, and looking for clues 
about your location. Once you've set everything 
right and determined where you are, you call Yoshi 
on your Globulator so he can track you down. You 
need Yoshi's help to eat the Pokey (a cactus-like 
creature) that's guarding the return portal, and 
when Luigi returns he can close the portal 
forever. 
 
By exploring these 25 cities, children can 
familiarize themselves with the landmarks and 
artifacts that each city has. When Luigi returns 
the stolen artifacts to the proper places he can 
even take photographs of them. There is also an 
add-on disk you can purchase that adds ten 
additional cities to the game (it originally 
retailed for $24.95).

as its predecessor. The game is played slab of 
stone with a grid on it. Above of every column and 
next to every row are numbers that acts as clues 
as to where a filled square is located along that 
column or row. The point of the game is to find 
all the filled squares on the grid by using your 
hammer and chiseling out squares that you think 
are filled and marking those that aren't with X. 
 
There are two different sets of puzzles available 
but you start off with only one, Mario's Picross, 
and when you completed the first level, Wario will 
pop in and offer you his set of puzzles. The 
difference between the two is that Mario's Picross 
have to be completed within a certain time. Every 
time you chisel out the wrong square, it will 
deduct time. If time runs out before you can solve 
the puzzle, it's game over. Wario's Picross are 
timed to see how long it will take you to complete 
it, but will not run out. The catch here is that 
you will not be notified of a wrong square. 
 
Other features includes game-saves, hints and

Maten Densetsu - Senritsu no O-parts (c) Oct 27, 
1995 TAKARA Co., Ltd. / TAKARA Co., Ltd. 
 
"Maten Densetsu" is a RPG set in post-apocalyptic 
Japan, similar in style and in gameplay to  Shin 
Megami Tensei and other  Megaten games. 
 
You find yourself in the middle of the Tokyo 
district Akihabara. But is this really Akihabara? 
The buildings have turned into ruins, and you 
wander around the deserted streets without any 
idea of how you could possibly be in such a place. 
A strange giant head appears in front of you, and 
defeats you in battle. When you wake up, you find 
out that Japan is floating in the air, and is 
attacked by a mysterious force that spawned 
countless demons who brought destruction to the 
cities. People are hiding among rubble and in 
underground passages. Some of them are fighting 
the demons, joining an organization called 
Self-Defense Forces. The hero's first objective is 
to find a way to his home district Shinjuku, where 
he will obtain more information about the power 
that threatens Japan, and discover mysterious 
artifacts from an unknown civilization, called 
ooparts (out-of-place artifacts). 
 
You can play as either one of the five characters 
presented to you in the beginning of the game: 
Rage, Rai, Hokuto, Seigi, and Daigo, each one 
having his own initial strengths and weaknesses. 
The entire game plays from first-person 
perspective. You navigate a cursor over the city 
map and check out your radar device to find out 
places of interest. The claustrophobic, extremely 
complex first-person 3D dungeons have a distinct 
Shin Megami Tensei flair. The battles are random 
and turn-based. Your main character doesn't gain 
levels, but instead accumulates energy points 
which can be then distributed freely to raise his 
strength, mental power, defense, etc. Certain 
characters join your party later in the game, and 
there are also friendly demons who would join you 
if you choose a correct way of behavior when you 
encounter them.

Math Blaster - Episode 1 (c) Oct, 1994 Davidson & 
Associates, Inc. / Davidson & Associates, 
Inc.|Western Technologies Inc. 
 
A follow-up to the original Math Blaster! games, 
Math Blaster: In Search of Spot is an educational 
title with arcade elements designed to help 
students learn maths while having fun. 
 
The game allows students to practice basic 
addition, subtraction, multiplication, and 
division skills in addition to fractions, 
decimals, percents, estimation, and number 
patterns. The subjects can be practiced separately 
or together in review. Six levels of difficulty 
are provided. Like the previous titles, the game 
also includes an editor to create new problem sets 
(present in the PC version only). 
 
Math Blaster's friend and assistant, Spot, is 
kidnapped by the evil Trash Alien at the beginning 
of the game. The Galactic Commander gives Math 
Blaster the mission to follow the Trash Alien to 
his home planet and rescue Spot. 
 
The game starts with a complete mission (story 
mode). The mission consists of a series of four 
(three in the console versions) math activities 
(mini-games) strung together with cut-scenes. The 
activities can also be played separately, for 
practice or for score. 
 
The activities are as follows: 
 
1. Trash Zapper - Solve equations to gain 
   tractor beam power, then use the tractor beam 
   to collect space trash. 
 
2. Number Recycler (PC version only) - Create 
   equations by pushing around columns of numbers 
   and operators. Correct equations allow you to 
   turn the trash you collected into fuel. 
 
3. Cave Runner - Use Math Blaster's jet pack to 
   fly through a cave. He has a number on his 
   chest, and it must be arithmetically between 
   the numbers on each side of an opening in order 
   for him to pass through. Droplets of water 
   falling from above can change this number by 
   performing an operation on it. There are also 
   gems which can be collected for bonus points, 
   and in higher levels, monsters appear that can 
   knock Math Blaster down. 
 
4. Math Blaster - The Trash Alien's spaceship 
   displays an equation, and the four portholes 
   serve as multiple-choice answers. Use the jet 
   pack to fly into the correct portholes while 
   avoiding floating trash and energy blasts from 
   the ship. Bonus gems also appear at random, and 
   after five problems a bonus round occurs where 
   players get a chance to collect as many gems as 
   they can within a time limit. 
 
Upon finishing the complete mission, the player is 
presented with a certificate that can be printed 
out (PC version only). Their final score is also 
added to a high score board for their account.

Maui Mallard in Cold Shadow (c) Nov, 1996 Disney 
Interactive, Inc. / Disney Interactive, Inc. 
 
Disney's Donald Duck takes the starring role in 
this sidescrolling platform game.  As the 
detective Maui Mallard, he's on the trail of a 
long lost Idol, which has recently vanished.  
Early on, Maui can also switch between his normal 
self and Ninja Maui, and with all the creepy 
voodoo enemies he'll encounter throughout his 
adventure, he's going to need all the help he can 
get. 
 
As previously mentioned, there are two 
personalities to Maui, and as a result, two 
different sets of controls.  Normal Maui carries a 
bug gun, which can fire a variety of different 
insect ammo, from basic bugs, to the more powerful 
lightning and fire bugs.  It's also possible for 
Maui to combine bugs to pack a more powerful blast 
at his enemies. 
 
Once Maui starts to find Yin-Yang coins, he'll be 
able to transform into Ninja Maui.  Ninja Maui has 
lightning-quick reflexes, and wields a bo staff.  
In addition to being handy for whacking enemies, 
Ninja Maui can also climb between walls by jumping 
and propping the staff between the walls at the 
height of his jump.  He can also hook onto duck 
heads and swing from them to reach areas he 
normally couldn't.  You'll need to constantly find 
Yin-Yang coins to fuel your Ninja persona, 
otherwise you'll run out and transform back to 
Maui Mallard.

Mazinger Z (c) Jun 25, 1993 Winky Soft / Bandai 
Co., Ltd. 
 
Dr. Hell's robot army has destroyed Tokyo, and 
    now only Kouji Kabuto, and the giant robot 
    Mazinger Z, can stop them from taking over the 
    entire world. Animated cutscenes between 
    levels tell the story of the game. 
 
The Mazinger Z comes with a full armory of 
anti-robot weaponry, from super-powered karate 
moves to missiles, Breast Fire, and its signature 
Rocket Punch. Special moves deplete a regenerating 
energy meter, while Rocket Punches can be 
preformed at any time, although Mazinger will be 
unable to punch until its arms return. Each level 
contains several varieties of enemies, all of them 
from the show and unique to each level, that must 
be defeated to progress. Some enemy robots will 
fire projectiles from a distance while others will 
rush in attempt to grapple the Mazinger, and 
sometimes more than one enemy must be fought at 
once. Enemies will drop healing items and 
occasionally an item that upgrades Mazinger's 
Rocket Punch to the Iron Cutter for a limited 
time. At the end of each level is a fight with a 
stronger boss robot with more dangerous attacks.

weather conditions and obstacles such as sand

can also practice their swing on the Driving Range

MechWarrior (c) 1993 Beam Software Pty., Ltd. / 
Activision, Inc. 
 
You are Gideon Braver Vandenburg, heir to the 
planet. While you were away, unknown attackers 
destroyed your home, killed your entire family, 
and stole the Chalice that you need to win the 
throne. When you are implicated in your own 
family's death, you are forced into exile. With a 
help of an old friend who contributed an old 
Jenner and some credits, you must become a 
mercenary. You must travel the Inner Sphere in 
search of clues to who set you up, and eventually 
avenge your family and recover the Chalice. You 
have five years. Good luck and good hunting. 
 
Mechwarrior was the first 3D BattleTech game 
developed. Dynamix (who later developed the 
Starsiege series) created it for Activision. You 
go to a planet and in search of "fixers" who will 
set up some contracts with the local authorities. 
The terms are a flat payment and some salvage 
payments. Some houses are very stingy but they 
tell you a lot about the mission. Others pay well 
but may not tell you everything. You can 
buy/sell/repair 'Mechs, hire/fire pilots, decide 
which planet to move to, as you try to maintain 
decent relationships with all five houses of the 
Inner Sphere, while trying to uncover clues about 
where you need to go. This ground-breaking game is 
very replayable, as each mission is randomly 
generated. There's even some extended campaigns 
where you run 2-3 missions in a row. 
 
(The following is the plot from the SNES version 
of Mechwarrior.) 
You are Herras Ragen. When you were 12 (3017) your 
father Colonel Joseph T. Ragen, a soldier in the 
House Davion army, was working to infiltrate and 
destroy a renegade mercenary cartel called the 
Dark Wing Lance and he had got in over his head.  
Somehow the members of the cartel got the location 
of your family's house on Redondo leaked to them 
from an unknown source. Before making their covert 
strike the lance made an agreement that they would 
separate for 10 years and maintain an absolute 
code of secrecy before regrouping again to 
continue their nefarious operations. 
 
One night the Lance attacked your families home 
killing everyone inside.  Over at a friend's you 
heard sounds of explosions. Rushing home you found 
a roaring inferno of what used to be the home you 
grew up with your family. Newly orphaned you vowed 
revenge on whoever had done this. 
 
The year is 3027. Now a young man, you cannot 
serve House Davion after what happened all those 
years ago. Now you make your living working as a 
freelance Mercenary on the planet Galatea selling 
your services to anyone whose contract will lead 
you closer to the insidious Dark Wing Lance.

Mega lo Mania (c) 1993 Sensible Software / 
Imagineer Co., Ltd. 
 
First you choose one out of four different 
characters to represent you, Scarlet (red army), 
Oberon (yellow army), Caesar (green army), or 
Madcap (blue army). The game is split into 10 
levels - the first 9 are groups of 3 territories 
which can be completed in any other, while the 
final 'Mother of All Battles' has its own 
surprises. 
 
Land is mostly of sand, grass or ice. You start 
with 100 men and you can use whatever quantity you 
find necessary on each island. The rest men left 
will go to another level with another new 100. In 
the second half of the game you can freeze men to 
save them for the Mother of All Battles. 
 
Once you select your island and place for your HQ, 
you must do some research for better weapons and 
defences. On the roof of your buildings you can 
put protectors like archers, gunmen, boiling oil 
men, and later on even laser turrets. If you send 
a team of unarmed men into an unoccupied square, 
they will build an additional base there, with 
larger armies completing this more quickly. 
 
Later on higher levels, you'll also build mines 
and factories, as you'll need to dig a certain 
material for higher level weapons, depending on 
whether the area you're on is rich with a certain 
material or not. With each next level, you'll 
start from a higher technology level and be able 
to progress to one higher level up then the at 
previous level. 
 
If there is more then just one enemy, you can make 
an alliance until you crush the other one - three 
of you can form an alliance against fourth enemy. 
For what its worth, a certain numeric level of 
defence is always stronger from the same level of 
attacker, and men that are not armed (conscripts) 
can only kill enemy soldiers, not destroy or 
attack enemy fort. 
 
The main thing as it always is in strategy games 
is to be the sole survivor and lead your men to 
victory, experimenting on vicious technologies, 
equipping your men, making a perfect soldiers out 
of them, produce shields, weapons, planes... to 
dominate the world and crush your opponents. 
 
You can do the battling only in a certain 
quadrant, but don't be long as your men will 
automatically start building the fort, and it will 
be at the bottom of age level and you'll need to 
invent everything for that one again.

But remember, Dr. Wily is mad, but he's not 
stupid. He had a backup plan...and all he had to 
do was just wait... 
 
6 months had passed, and somewhere from deep 
within Wily's abandoned lab, 4 hidden capsules 
activated and opened. His backup plan was in 
action...he had hidden 4 new Wily Robots that 
would spring him out of jail so he could continue 
his mad reign. 
 
When Mega Man hears the word that Wily was busting 
out of prison, he rushes onto the scene, only to 
encounter a strange robot he had never seen before 
named Bass. Bass tells Mega Man to back off, that 
he would stop Wily, and that Mega Man was no 
longer needed. 
 
Think that's gonna stop Mega Man? No way! Mega Man 
takes off to put a stop to Dr. Wily and find out 
exactly whose side Bass is on...

Mega Man Soccer is an overhead view soccer game 
featuring characters from the Mega Man series. 
Players begin by selecting either Exhibition, 
Tournament, League or Capcom Championship modes. 
Depending on the mode, a team must be formed using 
either all of one type of robot, or a mixture of 
different types assigned to different positions on 
the field. In any case, each soccer team has 8 
players on the field including the goalie. The 
goal of each team is to score on the net of the 
opposing team, earning points to win the game. The 
action follows the ball as it is tossed around the 
field from player to player. Once a player's team 
member has the ball they can choose to pass it to 
another teammate, shoot the ball straight ahead or 
perform a clearing kick (if the goalie). If the 
player does not have the ball, they are given 
control of the nearest player to the ball and can 
slide tackles or shoulder tackles to try to gain 
possession. Each type of robot has a special move 
that can be initiated.

The Antimatter Cold War has left Earth ruined as 
the stockpiled AM weapons of various nations were 
triggered in a chain effect, vaporizing large 
portions of the Earth. The once great continents 
have been drastically changed into thousands of 
tiny islands and various cities have washed into 
the oceans.  During this turmoil,  Zorgeuf the 
Great rushes to conquer the bewildered world along 
with a troop of commanders and declares the Earth 
Empire. The only hope to defeat him lies from 
without Earth, as the Colonial Forces send a 
command carrier from the major orbital base. With 
so many armies gone, the ground infantry unit has 
been replaced by the Metal Marine, a fifty foot 
armored robot that can be sent into battle for 
attack or defense. From their respective Command 
Center, each side in the conflict will need to 
direct the placement of facilities on the ground 
to defend against enemy attack, manage resources 
and successfully strike the enemy. 
 
Metal Marines is an isometric strategy game. 
Controlling one side of a conflict, the player 
must wage a campaign across several islands to 
defeat Zorgeuf and his lieutenants. The player 
controls logistics of the base to ensure that 
there are the necessary assets to wage war. On 
each map, the player places three underground 
command bases, if all of these are destroyed the 
battle is lost.  The player must manage the 
resources of their money to construct new 
buildings or upgrade existing facilities on the 
map. Different buildings include Energy Plants, 
Factories, Economic Centers, Radar systems, 
Anti-Aircraft missiles, fake buildings and fake HQ 
bases, mine fields, gun pods, missile launchers, 
metal marine hangers and even ICBMs.  At any time, 
the player may order an attack and choose which 
assets to fire at the opponent. Missiles, Metal 
Marines carriers and ICBMs all use different 
levels of fuel. Metal Marines once deployed in an 
area will automatically fire rifles at nearby 
targets or engage even closer targets in melee 
attacks. Gunpods, while stationary, will also fire 
on nearby enemies. Metal Marines are largely 
autonomous but can be manually controlled to a 
minor degree (directional) by the player.

Metal Max 2 (c) Mar 05, 1993 Crea-Tech Inc. / Data 
East Corporation 
 
This is a sequel to Metal Max. The game is set in 
a futuristic world. An evil organization known as 
the Grapplers terrorizes the world, destroying 
entire cities if they notice a sign of resistance. 
The elders of Mado City invited four famous 
monster hunters to defend the city against the 
Grapplers. One of the hunters, Maria, brought a 
friend with her - this friend is you, the hero of 
the game. But even the hunters can't withstand the 
Grapplers' assault. Their leader, the giant 
machine-like Ted Broiler, kills Maria. You are 
left on your own, and you decide to fight the 
Grapplers and to become a hunter yourself. 
 
The game is a Japanese-style RPG with random 
encounters and turn-based combat viewed from 
third-person perspective, like in Final Fantasy 
games. There are two kinds of combat in the game: 
standard character-to-character combat, and 
vehicle battles. vehicles can be purchased, 
equipped, and modified just like the characters 
themselves. Various vehicles have different 
special attacks, and there are plenty of items to 
collect that will upgrade and repair your 
vehicles. As a hunter, you can also hunt down 
various giant monsters that populate the world, 
and kill them for a reward.

Metal Max Returns (c) Sep 29, 1995 Crea-Tech Inc. 
/ Data East Corporation 
 
This is a remake of the game Metal Max, originally 
for NES. You are a little boy who lives with his 
father in a town in a futuristic world dominated 
by machines. Your wish is to become a "hunter" - 
to kill monsters that roam the world and to 
receive rewards for that. The storyline and the 
gameplay basics remained unchanged in this remake. 
You fight enemies in turn-based combat, and use 
vehicles, such as your own personal tank Mosquito, 
to transport yourself through different areas, and 
to participate in battles. You can also buy 
equipment and upgrade your vehicles. 
 
The remake features enhanced graphics and sound, 
background pictures for battles (they were black 
in the original), slightly different locations 
(more houses in towns, sometimes different layout 
of the towns and of the world map), and reduced 
difficulty level.

Metal Morph (c) 1994 ORIGIN Systems, Inc. / FCI 
 
In the year 2214, Earth has made contact with 
another dimension, known as Otherside.  As their 
ambassador, they choose to send the Metal Morph, a 
being made from living metal, as he is the only 
being that can survive the inter-dimensional 
travel.  The people of Earth have created a 
Hypergate, which links the two galaxies together.  
Upon arriving at the alien destination, the Metal 
Morph is quickly ambushed and is taken to an alien 
lab for study so that they can travel through the 
Hypergate themselves.  The Metal Morph quickly 
escapes and begins to get back to his sabotaged 
ship... 
 
Metal Morph is a side-scrolling platformer.  As 
the Metal Morph, you can jump, duck and shoot, as 
well as transform into an invulnerable liquid blob 
of metal.  While as a blob, you can also travel 
through pipes to get to areas you couldn't 
normally.  Power ups such as triple shots and 
homing missiles make battle easier for you. 
 
The game also has sections where you fly your 
spaceship to track down your stolen pods.  In 
flight mode, you can move the ship up, down, left 
and right while shooting enemies and dodging their 
incoming shots.  Power ups such as speed up (which 
makes the ship travel faster to its destination) 
and shields (which prevent instant death) can also 
be found.

Mickey to Donald - Magical Adventure 3 (c) Dec 08, 
1995 Capcom Co., Ltd. / Capcom Co., Ltd. 
 
Huey, Dewy and Louie went to hide in the attic to 
hide from their uncle Donald's temper when they 
came across a mysterious book.  Upon opening it, 
hand appears and kidnaps the boys into Storybook 
Land.  Now Donald Duck and his pal Mickey Mouse 
must go save the boys by defeating the evil King 
Pete! 
 
This game is for one to two players. You can 
choose to play as either Mickey Mouse or Donald 
Duck.  Options also include difficulty settings. 
 
The gameplay starts off much the way previous 
Magical Quest games have in that you jump on your 
enemies, spin them around, collect coins, etc.  
Later both Mickey and Donald will be given 
costumes that will give them special abilities.  
You will first receive a set of armor.  While 
Mickey receive a full knight's armor which 
includes a lance with a giant boxing glove at the 
end and a shield. Donald, however, gets a barrel 
and a hammer because his butt's too big for the 
armor. Both costumes has its pros and cons - for 
example, Donald's weapon can only be aimed forward 
while Mickey's can be aimed up/down/forward.  But, 
in water Mickey's armor will drag him down and 
sink while Donald's can float.  If playing with 
two players, these attributes can be used together 
so, for example, Mickey can take a ride on 
Donald's back across the water. 
 
In each stage, there are various hidden doors 
which will give you access to Bonus Games, shops 
and areas with coins and treasures. In a Bonus 
Game,  you will pick one of our three cards and 
unless you get the card with King Pete's picture, 
you will receive some sort of prize.  In the 
shops, you can purchase upgrades for your 
costumes, lives and hearts for your health meter.

Mickey's Ultimate Challenge (c) Feb, 1994 Designer 
Software|WayForward Technologies / Hi-Tech 
Expressions, Inc. 
 
One night, as Mickey (or Minnie) lay in bed 
reading a book of fairy tales, he started to 
wonder how it would be to live in a far off land, 
in a magic castle. As he fell asleep, he woke up 
in the Kingdom of Beanwick, which is constantly 
tormented by earthquakes. Then, he offers his help 
to solve the mystery behind those earthquakes. 
 
Mickey's Ultimate Challenge is a puzzle game in 
which the player chooses either Mickey or Minnie 
to play with. They'll find five characters from 
the Disney's universe in the kingdom, and will be 
prompted to help them in several tasks. 
 
Each task is a different puzzle, given by a 
specific character. Daisy, for instance, will ask 
help to clean the castle's paintings hanging on a 
wall. The task is in fact a memory game, where 
Mickey or Minnie must clean the pictures matching 
pairs. After completing one task, they'll receive 
a gift. 
 
After completing all tasks, Mickey or Minnie must 
trade the gifts they won with the right 
characters. For instance, after finishing Goofy's 
task, they will receive his hammer. The player 
must then guess who among the other characters 
would like to receive that hammer. 
 
Giving the right items to the right characters 
will allow Mickey or Minnie access to the last 
puzzle and character.

Micro Machines (c) 1994 Merit Studios, Inc. / 
Ocean Software Ltd. 
 
If you're bored of racing Formula 1 cars, rally 
cars or MotoGP bikes in their natural habitats, 
the Micro Machines series could be for you. It 
involves racing miniatures representing particular 
vehicle types across a particular terrain found 
around the house. The Sports Cars race on the 
desktop, 4x4s in the sandpit, Formula 1 cars on a 
snooker table, and so on. 
 
These levels were packed with variation. The 
Snooker tables has the track painted on, although 
this is open to deviation (as are most levels), 
and had you racing through the pockets and across 
the rim of the table. Tanks raced as well, with 
the chance of shooting out your opponent if they 
got directly in front of you. The desktop levels 
include binders to jump across, pencil-sharpeners 
to avoid, and lots of visual jokes in the open 
homework. 
 
Viewed from overhead with small graphics, the 
races include up to 4 cars. In one player 
challenge mode you race through the 21 tracks in a 
set order, selecting your 3 opponents as you go 
along (adding a fair amount of strategy - ideally 
you should aim to eliminate the better CPU cars 
early on), eliminating one after every third race 
(assuming that you can finish in the top 2 of a 
race within your 3 lives). If you win 3 races in a 
row without using a continue you get a time-trial 
race which can earn you an extra life. 
 
The real innovation of the game was in the 
multiplayer modes. You started with 4 points each, 
and when one car gets far enough ahead to force 
the other car off-screen, the slider moves in 
their favour. Once it reached the end (which 
involved beating them 4 times more than they beat 
you) you win the level, although if 3 laps were 
completed, the person leading at that point is 
declared the winner - with a sudden death play off 
if scores are level. 9 of the tracks are available 
in this mode, although you can also play this Head 
to Head system as a 1-player game across all the 
tracks.

Mighty Max (c) 1994 WJS Design / Ocean Software

The Adventures of Mighty Max is based on the TV 
cartoon Mighty Max which in turn is based on a 
series of toys. 
Max is a kid who possesses a magic cap that allows 
you to travel across different world and to save 
people who get in trouble in other dimensions. But 
his archenemy, the demonic Skull Master, has 
recently locked all the portals Max was using for 
inter-dimensional travel. However, the Skull 
Master has kept some of the portals for himself, 
keeping there some of his destructive weapons. 
It's time to destroy those weapons and to stop 
Skull Master! 
 
This is a platform game in which you control Max 
himself or one of his two side-kicks (that doesn't 
influence the gameplay). You travel through 
several different worlds. Your goal is to find 
Skull Master's weapons, which are scattered around 
the level, and to destroy them. The levels are 
timed, and there are also plenty of enemies who 
will disturb you on your way to the goal.

Mighty Morphin Power Rangers - The Fighting 
Edition (c) Sep, 1995 Natsume Co., Ltd. / Bandai 
America, Inc. 
 
Mighty Morphin Power Rangers: The Fighting Edition 
is a game directly based on the world-known 
television series. In this game, you can choice 
among 8 playable characters: the Power Rangers' 
Zords (Thunder Megazord, Mega Tigerzord, Ninja 
Megazord, Shogun Megazord) or some of their known 
villains (Lipsyncher, Silver Horns, Goldar, Lord 
Zedd). The title offers 3 game modes: Story Mode 
(1-Player only), Fighting Mode (2-Player) and 
Trial Mode (a survival mode for 1-Player only). 
 
During Story Mode, the goal is to defeat all the 4 
Zords, the 4 villains up to Lord Zedd and last, 
but not least, Ivan Ooze. In this mode, you can 
opt by the Thunder Megazord (formed by the 5 
original Rangers) or by the Mega Tigerzord (formed 
in conjunction with the White Ranger). The 
Fighting Mode is an traditional 2-Player 
head-to-head combat, where you can choose any of 
the 4 Zords or even the 4 villains. Trial Mode is 
a Endurance-like option, and the main goal is to 
win as many battles as possible using only 1 
health bar (that will be partially replenished 
after each battle). 
 
As well as many fighting games, you can take 
advantage of a Power Bar (here, it fills 
automatically): if you execute a Super Move when 
this bar is flashing, it will be cause more 
damage, besides increasing 1 level. Once you 
having reached its maximum status, it's possible 
to execute power-up versions of Special Moves or 
even unleash high-damage blows (Super Moves).

Mighty Morphin Power Rangers - The Movie (c) 1995 
Natsume Co., Ltd. / Bandai America, Inc. 
 
This game is loosely based off of the movie of the 
same name, where the player can take control of 
either the Yellow, Black, Pink, Blue, Red or White 
Ranger in a side-scrolling beat-em-up in an 
attempt to stop the evil Ivan Ooze who is trying 
to control the universe. 
 
There are six different levels to play in each 
with their own standard obstacles and enemies, 
mid-level bosses and of course end bosses that 
range from Mordant, Lord Zedd to Ivan Ooze 
himself.  There are no weapons that can be used, 
instead the player must rely on kicks and punches 
to dispatch enemies and pick up health items left 
behind. 
 
Additionally, the Yellow, Black, Pink Rangers are 
extremely fast and can jump into higher areas but 
are more weaker than Blue, Red, White Rangers who 
are much stronger, but lack the speed and jumping 
abilities of the other Rangers.  Players can 
refill their health by picking up heart icons and 
power icons to increase their morphing meter.  
Once filled, the morphing meter will increase the 
Rangers power, attack capabilities, speed and 
jumping abilities.

7 mazes with no constant "down". 
 
The boneless wonder (er, and his Walkman) pours 
himself into cracks, splatters against walls, 
curls into a defensive porcupine-koosh hybrid, 
always lands on his feet (by growing feet where 
his hands were!) and blasts apart into little 
jelly gibs as a special offensive attack.  Gross.  
And as if a radical surferpunk made of snot wasn't 
cool enough to begin with, a power-up gives him a 
chopper wheel in place of feet.  Dude is the hood

Monstania (c) Sep 27, 1996 Amccus|Bits Laboratory 
/ Pack-In-Video Co., Ltd 
 
The hero of the game is Fron, a sixteen-year old 
boy who lives on the island of Monstania. One day, 
strolling in the forest, he notices a strange 
light. The light lead him to a clearing, and then 
suddenly disappeared. But Fron realized what was 
the meaning of that light - it was a fairy! Of 
course, everybody knew that fairies had been long 
extinct, but Fron never believed in that. All his 
life he wanted to meet a real fairy, and now, when 
the opportunity has come, he firmly decides to 
find her. His girlfriend Tia helps him on the 
dangerous journey, during which they meet a 
mysterious little girl named Chitta, and get 
involved in a grand adventure, that will 
ultimately lead them to the battle against the 
dark force that threatens the whole Monstania! 
 
"Monstania" has a somewhat unusual gameplay within 
the frames of console RPGs. You don't explore the 
world in the game: it is entirely linear and takes 
you to the next destination by itself (only at a 
few points you can choose where to go next by 
selecting an appropriate answer). Once within the 
location, you cannot leave it until you complete 
all your objectives there, which then take you to 
the next location. The objective is usually a 
large strategic battle. You navigate your party 
members on the battle field, attack with melee and 
long-ranged weapons, and use special technique 
which require action points. Unlike most other 
turn-based strategy games, an enemy makes a move 
immediately after you did the same with one of 
your characters, without waiting for the "enemy 
turn". The RPG element is not very significant: 
your characters level up automatically after each 
battle. There are also some puzzles to solve in 
certain locations.

Mortal Kombat (c) Sep, 1993 Midway / Acclaim 
Entertainment, Inc. 
 
Five Hundred years ago, an ancient and well 
respected Shaolin fighting tournament, held every 
50 years, was corrupted by an evil and elderly 
sorcerer by the name of Shang Tsung.  Shang was 
accompanied by Prince Goro, a warrior of the 
Shokan race (a four armed half-human/half-dragon). 
Knowing that if ten tournaments in a row were won 
by the Outworld champion, the Earth Realm would be 
conquered by evil and fall into darkness, Shang 
entered Goro in the tournament and had him defeat 
the great Kung Lao. Goro has been  reigning 
supreme as the undefeated fighting champion for 
five hundred years now. As the last tournament 
required draws near, Raiden, Thunder God and 
protector of the Earth Realm, enacts a plan to tip 
the scales in the humans favor, Seven fighters 
step into the arena on Shang Tsung's mysterious 
island: Shaolin warrior Liu Kang, Special Forces 
operative Sonya Blade, the mercenary thug Kano, 
fame-seeking actor Johnny Cage, the ice wielding 
Lin Kuei warrior Sub-Zero and his undead adversary 
Scorpion, and Raiden himself. 
 
Mortal Kombat is a side-scrolling 1 on 1 fighting 
game. Fighting is set as one on one kombat, 
allowing each player to perform a variety of 
punches, kicks, and special moves in order to 
defeat their opponent.  When the opponent faces 
their second round loss, the winner can perform a 
finishing move called a "Fatality" on the loser.  
The Fatality is a move unique to each fighter that 
graphically kills the loser in a blood-soaked 
finale. 
 
Mortal Kombat began its life as a 2-player arcade 
title. It is notable for its use of digitized 
actors to represent the game's fighters, as well 
as its use of copious amounts of blood during 
gameplay.

Mortal Kombat 3 (c) Oct, 1995 Midway Games, Inc. / 
Williams Entertainment Inc. 
 
Shao Kahn has won. The Earthrealm is no more. In 
order to revive his Queen Sindel, the emperor Shao 
Kahn used the Outworld Tournament from Mortal 
Kombat 2 as a diversion while his Shadow Priests 
revive his fallen Queen on Earth. Once enacted, 
the dimensional bridge between the two realms 
connects, allowing Kahn's extermination squads to 
invade and destroy Earth, and enslave the 
population's souls. 
 
A small team of Raiden's "Chosen Warriors" 
survives the attack: Mortal Kombat champion Liu 
Kang and his ally Kung Lao, Special Forces agents 
Sonya Blade and Jax, the shaman Nightwolf, the 
riot cop Stryker, the nomadic Kabal, and former 
Lin Kuei warrior Sub-Zero, who has gone rogue from 
his clan. Facing the warriors are the mercenary 
Kano, cyber-ninjas Smoke, Sektor and Cyrax, 
Sheeva, a female Shokan, the sorcerer Shang Tsung, 
and Queen Sindel herself. 
 
Mortal Kombat 3 brings new elements to the 2D 
fighting series: multi-level playfields, 
"Dial-A-Combo" attacks, a "Run" button to speed up 
the battles, and "Vs." codes, which unlock new 
powers and abilities once both players enter a 
code sequence in pre-match-up screens. Also 
included are more stage fatalities and finishing 
moves as each warrior attempts to go one-on-one 
with the Centaurian enforcer Motaro, and Shao Kahn 
himself. 
 
Mortal Kombat 3 is the last traditional one-on-one 
fighting game game in the series to feature 
motion-captured digitized graphics for its 
kombatants, and introduces online network play to 
the PC version.

Moryou Senki Madara 2 (c) Jul 16, 1993 Konami 
Corporation / Konami Corporation 
 
Set partly in modern-day world and partly in a 
fantasy medieval Japan, the game is based on the 
manga/animé series Madara. Loosely connected to 
Buddhist and local Japanese myths, it tells the 
story of Madara, the son of the evil Emperor 
Miroku. An ancient prophecy said that a young 
warrior with tremendous powers will dethrone 
Miroku, and for fear of his son's might he ordered 
to cut his body into eight pieces. Raised with 
artificial limbs, Madara soon discovered his true 
origin and   understood he was destined to bring 
down his father. 
 
The game puts you in the role of a teenager named 
Kamishiro, who lives in modern-day Japan. One day 
he and his girlfriend Subaru venture into a 
mysterious shrine on the outskirts of their home 
town, and Kamishiro met the princess Sakuya, who 
explained to him that he must travel to a 
different world and to help Madara to get rid of 
Miroku. During his travels Kamishiro meets many 
characters from the original manga story, 
including Madara's brother and rival, Kage-Ou, and 
discovers the secret connection between the two 
worlds. 
 
The game is a console-style RPG with random 
battles. The combat system is turn-based, but the 
battles are set in auto mode, and you must pause 
them in order to assign commands to your 
characters. The battles are viewed from a dynamic 
third-person perspective, and the characters move 
around the battle field when executing their 
attacks. You can also change formation of your 
party, and use a variety of magic spells.

girlfriend, Ms. Pac-Man.  This sequel continued on 
the "eat the dots/avoid the ghosts" gameplay of 
the original game, but added new features to keep 
the title fresh. 
 
Like her boyfriend, Ms. Pac-Man attempts to clear 
four various and challenging mazes filled with 
dots and ever-moving bouncing fruit  while 
avoiding Inky, Blinky, Pinky and Sue, each with 
their own personalities and tactics.  One touch 
from any of these ghosts means a loss of life for 
Ms. Pac-Man. 
 
Ms. Pac-Man can turn the tables on her 
    pursuers by eating one of the four Energizers 
    located within the maze. During this time, the 
    ghosts turn blue, and Ms. Pac-Man can eat them 
    for bonus points (ranging from 200, 400, 800 
    and 1600, progressively). The Energizer power 
    only lasts for a limited amount of time, as 
    the ghost's eyes float back to their center 
    box, and regenerate to chase after Ms. Pac-Man 
    again. 
 
Survive a few rounds of gameplay, and the player 
will be treated to humorous intermissions showing 
the growing romantic relationship between Pac-Man 
and Ms. Pac-Man, leading all the way up to the 
arrival of "Junior".

Mystic Ark (c) Jul 14, 1995 Produce Co., Ltd. / 
Enix Corporation 
 
Seven heroes from seven different Worlds. Seven 
heroes who were brought to a mysterious temple on 
a remote island and transformed into statues. 
Seven heroes who are chosen to bring harmony back 
to the universe: Miriene the witch (wizard), Lux 
the tetsujin (a race of iron people), Reeshina the 
grappler (monk), Tokio the ninja, Kamio the ogre, 
and Mesia the priestess. The seventh hero is you, 
the protagonist of the game - the knight Remeer or 
the female warrior Ferris. Your first task will be 
to release your companions from the statues they 
are locked in. You must travel to the Cat World 
and to retrieve an important artifact. But your 
main objective is to visit all the seven Worlds 
and to find seven mystic arks - the items that 
will re-unite those Worlds and bring peace to 
them. 
 
"Mystic Ark" is a RPG closely connected to  7th 
Saga. You travel on overworld map, visit towns, 
buy equipment, and descend into dungeons. The 
combat is turn-based and viewed from a 
third-person "over-the-shoulder" perspective. The 
battles are not random: the enemies can be seen as 
white dots on your radar, and if you don't want to 
fight, you can sometimes outrun or avoid them. The 
game also contains elements of pure adventure: 
often you must investigate objects closely and use 
items from your inventory on them.

NBA Jam (c) Mar, 1994 Midway Games, Inc. / Acclaim 
Entertainment, Inc. 
 
NBA Jam is a two-on-two basketball game You can 
play any NBA team, and you can play as players 
like Barkley, Starks, Pippen, and Grant. Each 
human player controls a single player, so choose 
your squad wisely to take team-mate skill into 
account. The game is action-oriented, and players 
can perform unrealistic slam-dunks. Full 
performance statistics are automatically recorded. 
The play clock and 3-point line apply, but other 
rules are largely overlooked.

NBA Jam - Tournament Edition (c) 1994 Midway 
Games, Inc. / Acclaim Entertainment, Inc. 
 
This game lets you play two-on-two arcade 
basketball with players from all the NBA teams. 
Gameplay is fast and action-packed, with few 
rules, no fouls, and deliberately unrealistic 
jamming. Players are rated on eight ability 
categories, from steals and blocks, to dunks and 
3-pointers. 
 
Up to four human players can take part, each 
always controlling a single player for their team, 
and AI for missing players. This allows for four 
players to face each other in teams of two, or for 
two players to team up against a third player with 
a CPU team-mate. 
 
The Tournament Edition ups each team's roster to 
three players, and allows for substitutions 
between quarters. Shoving players now results in 
injuries, which lower a player's stats

Nekketsu Tairiku Burning Heroes (c) Mar 17, 1995 
J-Force / Enix Corporation 
 
The young fighter Ryu was thrown out of his 
father's home, and this childhood trauma has been 
dominating his life ever since. His only wish is 
to surpass his father and to show him he has 
become a better fighter than him. Laila is a 
cheerful treasure hunter. She dreams only of 
valuable things, adventure, travels, and life in 
the capital city.  Gaou is experiencing a personal 
tragedy: he wants to discover the mystery of the 
disappearance of a woman he loved, Asuka, aided by 
his best friend Froz. Naaga is a girl who wears a 
heavy armor, which - as she thinks - will prevent 
her from losing any battle. At present, she has 
problems since she owes a million gold pieces to 
her guild. What do those heroes have in common? As 
their ways cross, they will find out they are in 
fact pursuing one and the same goal... 
 
"Burning Heroes" lets you start as either one of 
the four characters. Each one starts in a 
different place and is seemingly absorbed in 
his/her personal quest, but as the game 
progresses, the four heroes meet each other. You 
should also find and "unlock"  four other playable 
characters as you advance in the game. The 
gameplay system of "Burning Heroes" is similar to 
other console-style RPGs: you fight random enemies 
and bosses in turn-based combat, viewed from 
third-person perspective, like in  Final Fantasy 
games. As you get hit in a battle, your "passion" 
(literally "hot blood", nekketsu in Japanese) 
level rises, and the more damage you take, the 
quicker you reach 100%. Once the passion bar is 
full, you can summon a powerful monster and to 
unleash a devastating attack on the entire enemy 
party.

Newman-Hass Indy Car Featuring Nigel Mansell (c) 
Dec 16, 1994 Gremlin Graphics Software Ltd. / 
Acclaim Entertainment, Inc. 
 
Newman Haas Indy Car is, as the name shows, a 
racing game endorsed by the CART racing team of 
the same name and their top driver at the time, 
Englishman Nigel Mansell. 
 
The player has the option to drive a single race 
(where the option to practice is hidden) or go for 
the crown against 12 other drivers in 15 tracks 
(with some variety, not only ovals) across North 
America, with the season opener in Queensland, 
Australia. It is possible play solo, with a friend 
in split screen or with split screen against the 
computer, and if music or engine sounds are played 
in the race. 
A key choice in the game is selecting between 
Arcade and Simulation mode - in the later, the car 
can take a lot less damage before giving up, 
fine-tuning must be done by the driver and rules 
are enforced, under the risk of a 
disqualification. 
 
Graphically, the game is less sterile than most 
driving games of the platform (and in 16-bit 
consoles, generally), thanks to the inclusion of 
several polygonal buildings scattered around the 
circuits.

NHL '94 (c) Oct, 1993 EA Canada / Electronic Arts,

After establishing themselves in the virtual 
rinks, EA combined both NHL and NHLPA licenses in 
NHL '94, allowing them to feature all 26 real 
teams (including both expansion teams) and players 
of the new NHL season for the first time in the 
series. 
 
Aside from the licenses, the gameplay for this 
edition sees for the first time the inclusion of 
the devastating one-timer shot, but to keep 
forwards (literally) in check, defenders also 
feature harder body checks, with new animations. 
For an additional challenge, players can also 
choose to control the goalkeeper manually. A 
popular feature in previous editions, fighting is 
completely removed from the game. Game modes 
include exhibition games (or "regular season" 
in-game), playoffs (best of one or best of seven) 
and an all new shoot-out mode. The main options 
remain basically the same couple since the 
establishment of the series - period length (5, 10 
or 20 minutes), line changes (off, manual or the 
new automatic mode) and penalties. (off, on, on 
but no offsides). 
 
While there are some minor differences between 
platforms (Genesis  features record keeping for 
users and the MegaCD version has more stat 
screens, CD quality audio backdrops and the usual 
highlight clips here and there), only the PC 
version released at the same time features 
complete season action.

Viacom New Media 
 
Nickelodeon GUTS is based off of the Nickelodeon 
TV show in the late 90's that is basically 
American Gladiators for kids.  The events in the 
game are based off of the actual game show events 
with the main goal being to score as many points 
as possible while trying to beat the clock. 
 
In Elastic Sports, the player is strapped onto a 
long bungee cord and is bounced around.  There are 
three events: Slam Dunk is a basketball game, 
Attack is lacrosse and Spiral where the objective 
is to throw a football through a hanging tire. 
 
Action Sports is an obstacle course which someone 
would find at a boot camp and is divided into two 
events:  Basic Training involves poles, swinging 
ropes and punching bags and Tornado Run which adds 
water jets and moving platforms.  Players can also 
pick up bonus items that will add time or 
replenish health and a chance at the bonus round. 
 
The final event is the Aggro Crag which is a giant 
indoor mountain the player must climb while 
avoiding various obstacles such as confetti 
cannons, moving platforms and smoke vents.  The 
goal of this event is to navigate the mountain and 
activate five different sensors located on the 
mountain before being able to activate the last

Nigel Mansell's World Championship Racing (c) Jul, 
1993 Gremlin Graphics Software Ltd. / GameTek, 
Inc. 
 
Timing smiled on Gremlin with this licensed 
Formula 1 simulation, as Nigel's long quest for a 
championship had finally come good. The game was 
pitched somewhere in between a full-blown 
simulation like F1 GP and action games like 
Continental Circus. Only 12 cars were in each 
race, which could last from between 3 and 20 laps. 
 
Before each race you can customize wing downforce, 
gear ratio, tyre selection and fuel load choices – 
pitstops are a standard feature of the longer 
races. The 16-bit versions include a unique 
'Improve With Mansell' mode, in which a digitized 
version of Nigel's head appears in the top corner 
of the screen, offering instructions and praise.

The land is under the grip of a tyrant named 
Benglar, who is able to brainwash those he 
captures. Using this ability he has taken over the 
military forces and now appears unstoppable. 
However, resistance forces lead by Mulk have been 
developing a new weapon: Cybernetic Special Forces 
with the ability to think, dubbed the Ninja 
Warriors. Untested, these machines are given the 
orders to assassinate Benglar... 
 
Ninja Warriors plays as a side scrolling beat 'em 
up, and is a single player adaptation of The Ninja 
Warriors arcade game. Players can choose from 3 
different Ninja Warriors: Ninja, Kunoichi or 
Kamaitachi. The characters play differently, but 
share some common controls. Each can attack, jump, 
grab the enemy, block attacks or unleash a special 
attack on the entire screen. This special attack 
charges up gradually and can be reset by being 
knocked to the ground.

Nobunaga's Ambition (c) 1994 KOEI Co., Ltd. / KOEI 
Corporation 
 
In the 16th century, Japan's Sengoku ("Warring 
States") period divided the nation into numerous 
feudal states, each ruled by a daimyo. These 
daimyos would often go to war with each other. 
Many dreamt of conquering the land, becoming the 
Shogun and ruling the entire country. One of those 
daimyos was the ambitious Nobunaga Oda, a 
merciless ruler and a renowned strategist. Players 
take on the role of Nobunaga Oda or one of many 
other daimyos to try to conquer Japan. 
 
Nobunaga's Ambition is a turn-based strategy game 
which can be played in different modes. Gameplay 
is similar to Koei's better known Romance of the 
Three Kingdoms game. Players begin by selecting 
either a 17 regions scenario or a larger 50 
scenario. Then, the player must select a daimyo, 
each of which is rated attributes in several 
categories

Based on the 1994 movie of the same name starring 
Ray Liotta, the player takes control of Liotta's 
character, Capt. J.T. Robbins, whose only 
objective of the game is to escape an island. 
After shooting his commanding officer, Robbins is 
imprisoned and eventually sent to the island 
Absolom as a war criminal, from where there is no 
escape possible. To do this still, the player must 
explore the island with side-scrolling platform 
gameplay for clues, finding items and combining 
them to make weapons and traps. 
 
Robbins can talk to some prisoners to help him in 
his quest, but he must also avoid violent 
prisoners, either by attacking them with punches 
or kicks or using traps and stealth to bypass 
them. The graphics are based off of rotoscopes of 
the actual actors from the movie.

The gameplay consists of a combination of arcade 
elements and first person view much like Eye of 
the Beholder and Dungeon Master.  One of the more 
remarkable features is in the first person mode, 
rather than having just 4 directs to face and 
flicking between them there are 8 directions and 
the view scrolls smoothly as you turn. This smooth 
scrolling continues when you move forward, giving 
the game more of a 3D feel. 
 
The arcade elements consist of horizontal 
scrolling areas where you fight enemies with your 
bow while avoiding their attacks.  Later you 
encounter a similar type of gameplay that involves 
exploring castles and adds 4 directional movement.

Olympic Summer Games 96 (c) 1996 Tiertex Ltd. / 
Black Pearl Software 
 
Olympic Summer Games is the 16-bit official 
videogame of the 1996 Olympic Games held in 
Atlanta, the third and the last IOC official title 
to be released on the console. A typical button 
masher, includes 10 events (100m sprint, 110m 
hurdles, pole vault, long jump, triple jump, 
javelin, high jump, discus, skeet and archery) and 
32 countries around the world compete in custom or 
full Olympics, or just practice. Two players can 
compete head to head in the sprinting events, and 
a total of eight can play in the same game. Three 
difficulty levels allow competitive events for 
both rookies to veterans in the genre. 
 
Sprinting events are a short and straight button 
mashing frenzy. 4 athletes compete simultaneously, 
the first winner advancing to the next round (two 
qualifiers and then the medal run). Only fast 
fingers and quick shotgun reaction can earn world 
record times. 
 
Jumping events are a mix of shorter button mashing 
bursts combined with timely pressed jumps. From 
the straight forward high and long jump events 
(run and then set the jump angle) to the more 
elaborate triple jump (as the name suggests, three 
jumps must be carefully measured for world class 
results) and the complex pole vault, where a 
strong run must be followed by a sharp pole 
fixation and good a release upwards. Both long 
jump and triple jump have a first round composed 
by three jumps, the better eight progress into the 
second round, where they are given three more 
jumps. In the high jump and pole vault the 
competition continues until all athletes miss 
three consecutive jumps. 
 
The throwing events (discus and javelin) work in 
the same fashion as the jumping events, although 
trickier to pull, as the setting of the angle must 
be followed by a timely release. Each player is 
entitled to three throws, the top eight allowed 
three more attempts. 
 
Finally, the shooting events. Archery is a 
three-round competition where the goal is to amass 
as many points as possible by shooting at the 
inner rings of the target. With six arrows per 
round, each shot must be calculated according to 
the wind, choosing between steady aim and lower 
tension (must be aimed upwards and compensating 
the wind) or higher tension but a jumpy aim (can 
be aimed directly at the "gold" points). Skeet is 
a five round competition where the goal is to hit 
five clay pigeons before they disappear off-screen 
with two slugs for each.

both by directly influencing the actions of the

At a secret lab developing technology in

the facility and the power shut down. The 
dimensional fabric surrounding the facility seems 
weak and strange monsters have been sighted. 
Concerned, an unknown agency preps a cybernetic 
soldier and his weapons to investigate... 
 
Playing as the bionic soldier, this game is a 
top-down shooter. The player must blast their way 
through enemy forces and the activate various 
switches to progress. Accessing computer memory 
banks throughout the facility will reveal footage 
of the accident and give some idea of all it 
happened. Additionally, dimensional holes have 
opened up all around the levels allowing monsters 
to appear and making certain paths, walls and 
technologies inaccessible until the area has been 
stabilized. 
 
The soldier uses a main weapon and a secondary 
weapon to progress, both of which can be cycled at 
any time and upgraded to new weapons found in the 
area.

Operation Thunderbolt (c) Oct, 1994 Taito 
Corporation / Taito Corporation 
 
Operation Thunderbolt is the exciting sequel to 
Operation Wolf. An airliner is hijacked by 
terrorists en-route from Paris to Boston, who 
threaten to kill all hostages on board if their 
mates aren't released from jail. Instead of 
reaching its destination, the airliner makes a 
landing in Kalubya, Africa, and all the hostages 
are hidden in various locations. The authorities 
have asked the hero from Operation Wolf to rescue 
the hostages, but only this time, the hero brings 
his friend along for the ride. 
 
There are eight missions to complete in Operation 
Thunderbolt, and each one has you shooting down 
soldiers, choppers, and tanks. The gameplay varies 
every one or two missions. In some missions, you 
are driving a jeep or controlling a boat, while in 
others, you are walking while you're shooting. You 
have a limited supply of ammo, and a limited 
supply of rocket bombs, but you can always stock 
up by shooting down crates falling from the sky, 
or by killing a cat or dog that get in the line of 
fire. Also from crates, you can get special items 
like bulletproof vests, rocket bombs, and 
different weapons. 
 
You also have a life bar to worry about. If you're 
shot at by soldiers, or if rocket bombs or 
grenades are thrown at you, you 'll lose energy, 
and once you're energy is depleted,  you lose one 
of your three lives. You can lose a lot of energy 
by killing hostages on purpose,  and you can't 
easily avoid killing them if you decide to use 
rocket bombs to wipe out enemies. The eighth 
mission, the mission that involves you fighting 
terrorists on a plane,  proves to be difficult 
because a woman in a blue dress stands up and gets 
in the line of fire, and you have to very careful 
when you're going to use rocket bombs. 
 
There are two endings to this game, and which 
ending you can watch will depend on the number of 
hostages you've saved, and whether or not you shot 
the pilot instead of the mission eight boss.

Mindscape developed this game hoping to get it 
licensed as an official Mad Max game, however 
Warner Bros never made this happen. Anyway, the 
game closely resembles "The Road Warrior" (Mad Max 
2). Your objective is to drive your car through 
the wasteland, trying to survive motorcycle gang 
members' attacks and to avoid running out of gas. 
 
The gameplay is a split of two genres: racing and 
side-scrolling. In the racing parts you have to 
destroy enemies like motorcycle gang members, 
gyro-copter captains, red trucks, etc. Your car 
has a machine-gun installed in its front, and if 
some guy drives along side of you, a little window 
pops up, allowing you to shoot them with your 
shotgun. 
 
Along the road there are several towns, and every 
time you pass through one of them, an alarm will 
warn you. As your gas run low, you have to stop on 
these towns and refuel your reserves of gas and 
ammo. When doing so, the game turns to a 
side-scrolling perspective, as you get out of your 
car, dealing with your enemies in hand-to-hand 
combats. In the cities you'll also find new 
equipment to your car, such as missile launchers, 
nitro, etc.

You play Lester, a young physics professor, who 
suddenly finds himself in a strange alien world 
after a lightning struck during his particle 
experiment. Now he must fight for his life, first 
with his bare hands, then with a gun he finds. But 
what gives him courage is that he is not alone. 
One of the aliens, who together with him escapes 
from the prison, helps him on his dangerous quest. 
Friendship can overcome all the obstacles. 
 
Out of This World is an action adventure game, 
where the adventuring element is concealed behind 
what looks like a typical platform shooter. The 
gameplay is based mainly on physical and 
environmental puzzles. There is no on-screen 
interface, and no in-game dialogue. Each enemy 
requires a different strategy, and often there is 
only one way to solve the problem. Typically, 
enemies will be defeated through the use of a gun 
you find near the beginning of the game

Pac-Attack (c) Oct, 1993 Namco Limited / Namco 
   Hometek Inc. 
 
Based on Namco's Japanese-only arcade puzzler 
Cosmo Gang the Puzzle, Pac-Attack is similar to 
many block-dropping puzzle games from the time, 
such as Puyo Puyo. 
 
The objective of the game is to place ghosts and 
then, after three pieces (which can include one or 
two blocks as well), make Pac-Man eat as many 
ghosts as possible to try and clear up the game 
area. Pac-Man's directions are chosen at random 
between left or right, but as he goes moving on 
the game area (after you place him, of course), if 
he bumps against a block or a "wall" on the game 
area, he will change his direction. As with many 
block-dropping puzzlers, if a line of blocks 
and/or ghosts reaches the top, the game ends. 
However, by filling up a meter on the left of the 
game area, a fairy may appear that can clear 
approximately 6 or 7 lines with ghosts, but it 
only clears the ghosts, although the blocks that 
were on top of them will drop. 
 
Also, like many puzzlers, it contains a versus 
mode against another human player. It's similar to 
the many versus modes of puzzle games: eat plenty 
of ghosts and your opponent will recieve many 
ghosts on his area. 
 
The game also includes a Puzzle mode. It features 
100 levels, in which you have to eat all ghosts 
with no more than 4 Pac-Men at least (the number 
reduces in certain levels), and, unlike the other 
modes, you can change Pac-Man's direction with the 
press of a button. 
 
All of the handheld versions (including the one on 
Pac-Man Collection) lack the versus mode.

Pac-in-Time (c) Jan, 1995 Atreid Concept SA /

Everybody knows what/who Pac-Man is from his 
heyday in the '80s, but this time, we're getting a 
whole new adventure of our little eater. Guess his 
stomach is full, 'cause there's nothing much to 
eat here, only collecting points. This is much 
like some Indiana Jones adventure, only your 
little hero's Pac-Man instead of Harrison Ford. 
 
Pac-in-time is the US release of Fury of the 
   Furries. It's exactly the same game. Only the 
   characters were changed: the not-so-known 
   European Tinies (from the Skweek/Super 
   Skweek/Tiny Skweeks/Brainies/Tinies games) were 
   replaced by the widely known Pac-Man.

Peace Keepers, The (c) Mar, 1994 Jaleco Ltd. / 
Jaleco USA, Inc. 
 
It's the year 2015 and the most powerful 
organization of the planet, a company named 
Deutschland Moldavia, is threatening to take over 
the world by genetically manipulatin humans into 
mindless slaves or powerful monsters. 
 
The Peace Keepers is a side-scrolling fighting 
game similar to games in the Final Fight series. 
The player can choose from four characters (plus 
two that become available later in the game) with 
different strengths and weaknesses. In addition to 
combinations of standard attacks, jump-, run-  and 
throwing attacks, all characters can also block 
attacks, perform single heavy attacks, special 
attacks that consume a certain amount of energy 
and super attacks. Super attacks damage all 
enemies on-screen, but can only be used twice per 
continue. If a character is hit repeatedly, there 
is a chance that they temporarily switch into 
"angry-mode" during which they are invincible and 
more powerful. 
 
Most levels offer different paths and exits, and 
after every level, a different character may be 
selected. This means that levels may be played 
through in different orders and that it is not at 
all necessary to play through all the levels to 
reach one of several endings.

Pebble Beach Golf Links (c) 1992 T&E&nbsp / 
T&E&nbsp 
 
Players take on the challenge of one of the most 
beautiful and notorious golf courses in the world: 
Pebble Beach. These eighteen-holes demand 
accuracy, finesse, and even at times brute 
strength. The famous beach-side course is littered 
with sand-bunkers as well as sweeping fairways and 
cliff-side greens. 
 
Game play takes a classic approach - players 
control a selected golfer from a third-person 
perspective. Swing-control is displayed as a power 
and accuracy meter with which players must start 
and stop accordingly. Again, the classic-style 
putting system, complete with a topographic grid, 
lets the player know of the slope and elevation of 
the three-dimensional putting surface. 
 
As there are no other courses to play, this game 
is a tribute and testament to the challenging 
course-design of Pebble Beach Golf Links.

PGA European Tour (c) Sep, 1996 Halestorm, Inc. / 
Black Pearl Software 
 
European Tour is best thought of as a remake of 
the original game, rather than a sequel as such. 
It features 5 courses from across Europe, and 60 
top European pros, rather than the US-leaned 
lineup of the original. The graphics are much more 
detailed and colorful, as you'd expect considering 
the intervening years of advances in programming 
skill. 
 
The control system is the standard three-click 
method used in most golf games, but you can now 
define intended draw/fade levels in advance of 
playing the shot, so that a perfect aim leads to a 
measured effect, and an imperfect one exaggerating 
the effect. 
 
As well as the Stroke Play games of the original 
(where you count the total score across the whole 
round of 18 holes, and compare this to your 
opponent), there are also Match Play (where the 
aim is to win as many individual holes as 
possible) and Skins (the same, but with money) 
modes as well.

PGA Tour 96 (c) 1995 Black Pearl Software / 
Electronic Arts, Inc. 
 
PGA Tour 96 was the last of the series released 
for Sega's 16-bit console, and technologically the 
most advanced one. Instead of offering  several 
generic courses, the three available (Spyglass 
Hill, Sawgrass and River Highlands) are in 3D, 
with height differences visible (as well as the 
limited 3D abilities of the console allow). 
 
The player can either chose to play as one of the 
10 PGA Pros (whose swings were digitized), or go 
Pro - the game keeps track of statistics (longest 
drive, driving accuracy, best round, etc), a game 
(Tournament, Strokeplay, Skins, Match and 
Shootout), as well as a replay. 
 
Gameplaywise, PGA 96 uses the tried-and-proved 
triple click system - one to start the swing, 
other to set strength and a final one for 
accuracy. It's possible to fade or draw the ball 
(to bend the trajectory), add backspin and pitch 
or chip the ball (for some medium range attempts 
at the hole or go above a bush).The difficulty 
level affects mostly the leniency of the triple 
click hit areas - while at novice it is possible 
to let the accuracy a bit off-center, in pro 
levels the ball goes where your swing took it - no 
excuses taken. However, only in Pro it is possible 
to make the longest drives, as the amateur and 
novice levels take a few yards from the total 
capacity of the club.

PGA Tour Golf (c) 1991 Sterling Silver Software /

PGA Tour Golf introduced many of the conventions 
commonly seen in the genre since. The three-click 
control method (the first to start the swing, the 
second setting power and over-swing, the third 
setting draw or fade) allowed for a multitude of 
different shots, and required a sense of timing. 
 
Four courses are included, one of them a fantasy 
'links' course designed by the programmers. Some 
of the holes are fiendish, with bunkers, water 
hazards and trees, and the need to plan strategies 
to get the best approach to the green. 
 
When playing a tournament there are 60 opponents, 
each representing top US golfers - ten of these 
appear with tactical advice for each hole.

Pipe Dream (c) Aug 07, 1992 Distinctive Software, 
Inc. / Bullet-Proof Software, Inc. 
 
Each level of this abstract puzzler challenges the 
player to set up a network of pipes to allow an 
unspecified substance known as 'flooz' to flow 
through as many of those as possible. The pieces 
are offered in random order, and there are seven 
different types - straight lines going 
horizontally or vertically, corners rotating in 
each of the four directions, and cross-over pieces 
which carry the flooz straight across horizontally 
and vertically. Each of these can be entered from 
either side. When the flooz hits a gap, or a piece 
which the previous piece can't flow into, the pipe 
is finished. 
 
Before the flooz starts flowing from its 
randomly-selected starting position, the player 
has several seconds to start placing pieces. They 
can be put down anywhere. However a situation that 
can often occur is there will be a long and 
complex piping arrangement set up, yet a gap 
somewhere remains to be filled. Players are able 
to  replace a piece with another in the same 
square (to make it easier to flow the flooz that 
way), but for a slight scoring penalty. 
 
Bonuses are awarded for looping the flooz through 
both sides of at least 5 cross-over pieces, or 
passing the flooz through every square on the 
screen. Later levels have some squares on the grid 
blocked off, a few gaps in the side-wall (allowing 
flooz to thread to the other side of the screen). 
After every four levels there is a bonus game for 
points, in which the player can only place the 
pieces in the lowest open space in each column, 
similarly to the board game of "Connect 4".

must find the Treasures of Rule to control the 
Dark Water and return Mer to its former glory. 
Always hot on their heels is the evil pirate-lord 
Bloth who wants to find the treasures to rule over 
Mer. 
 
Based on a cartoon series by the same name, The 
Pirates of Dark Water is a side scrolling fighting 
game similar to Final Fight or Streets of Rage. 
 
The player chooses a character, from among Prince 
Ren and his two companions Tula and Ioz, who 
differ in strength and agility, but who use the 
same basic attacks. There are two attack buttons, 
one for fast attacks and combinations and one for 
a single heavy attack. Other controls include: 
blocking attacks, grabbing and throwing opponents, 
dash attacks while running, and a special attack 
that hits multiple enemies consuming life energy 
at the same time. Most levels also require you to 
avoid obstacles like chasms, falling rocks or 
spikes that shoot out of the ground.

In this platform action game, you play as a cute 
bounty hunter known as Popful Mail. While you 
might think that a cute Anime chick would have no 
trouble making a living slashing bad guys with her 
sword, Popful is having a hard time making ends 
meet.  One day, however, Popful learns about a 
magician who has gone rogue and has a hefty bounty 
on his head. So, her adventure begins as Popful 
fights her way through a new adventure, and makes 
new friends along the way. 
 
Primarily this is an action game with very slight 
RPG elements. As you make your way through the 
plethora of levels, you will have to collect money 
from slain foes. You use this money in the shops 
to buy weapons, armor, health, and so on. Also, 
this game features interaction with many, many 
characters through both on-screen dialog and fully 
animated sequences. Some of these characters 
become playable as you progress through the game. 
 
This release has the same story and general 
gameplay style as the  earlier version, but 
otherwise was made from scratch, having entirely 
different graphics, locations, enemies, 
challenges, etc.

You play a god, gaming against other gods in a

your chosen people take over the world and wipe 
out the vermin who worship that other god. 
 
Each god starts out with a single human, dumped 
into the middle of the wilderness.  Sometimes 
there is inhabitable land in sight, sometimes not. 
 To get win, you must change the landscape, 
creating flat land for your followers to build on. 
 The more followers you have you have, the more 
powerful you will be, so take care of them. Build 
as fast as you can, because the other god is doing 
the same. 
 
When you have enough followers, you can make the 
leader of your people into a hero.  He will then 
go around the land you have built, literally 
taking strength from the people into himself, and 
working his way toward the enemy.  When he gets 
there, he will engage in holy warfare upon your 
enemy's people.  He will burn

As the other games in the series Pop'n Twinbee is 
a vertically-scrolling arcade shooter in which you 
and a friend get behind the controls of Twinbee 
and Winbee, the cutest starfighters ever created, 
and try to clear stage after stage of enemies with 
your  weapons. Being a console original instead of 
a port, Pop'n features a number of additions to 
the gameplay mechanics, including an energy bar, 
eight difficulty levels and a handicap feature 
when playing with a friend (which makes most 
enemies target one fighter instead of the other). 
 
The upgrade system remains consistent with the 
series's: you shoot colored bells which give 
different power-ups when collected, including 
multiple shots, "options" and shield energy. Also 
when correctly powered-up both fighters can join 
and perform powerful team-up moves.

To deal with the many villains Dr. Warmon throws

Depending on the color of the bell you can use 
different attacks like a laser (blue bells) or a 
lash (orange bells). But even without the bells 
you're not defenseless. Your standard-attacks 
include a shock wave and the ability to fly.

scorched earth invasions all play a key role in 
how the player progressed through the game.

sorceress Dynastar. 
 
The game begins where the girls are already united

party contains nine girls, each one with various 
statistics and magic spells. The large party is 
divided into three smaller ones, and you switch 
between them while participating in random battles

is viewed from a top-down perspective, like the 
locations you visit. You travel on the overworld

Pro Quarterback (c) Dec, 1992 Leland Interactive 
Media / Tradewest, Inc. 
 
Pro Quarterback is a football game featuring 27 
different teams. Since this game doesn't have an 
NFL or NFLPA license, there aren't any real NFL 
teams or players here, although the teams included 
in the game represent the cities of their real 
life NFL counterparts and also mimic the colors of 
their team's uniforms. 
 
The games options allow the player to choose to 
play on 6 different field surfaces (grass, mud, 
dirt, snow, rain and artificial turf) and to 
choose how long the game will last (2, 5, 10 or 15 
minute quarters). There are also no penalties in 
this game whatsoever. 
 
Gameplay consists of playing on both offense and 
defense. There are 26 different offensive plays 
and 18 different defensive plays to choose from. 
The game has a down the field view when on 
offense, so the game doesn't have receivers in 
windows.

Push-Over (c) 1992 Red Rat Software Ltd / Ocean 
Software Ltd. 
 
You're playing a small ant that is willing to help 
a friend in rather inconvenient situation. 
Apparently, your friend, doggie, likes to eat 
cookies that has his picture on their box, and he 
got himself so carried away that he lost the 
balance, and a bag of cookies fell deep down into 
an ant-hill. Now, you're goin' in, in a mission of 
solving puzzles, and retrieving the cookies for 
your friend. 
 
Now, this ant-hill is a bit different from the 
ones you saw, and especially from the one you live 
in. It's path is filled up with boulders, and all 
the gates, and you must travel the quest to find 
the cookies. After each different place inside, 
you'll fins a small bag of cookie, and bring it 
back to your friend doggie. 
 
The main quest consists of you carrying your-size 
boulders, and placing them in a well imagined 
line, so when you push the exact one, all must 
fall, and the one that marks the end must fall the 
last, or the door will stay shut permanently. 
Beside we know that ants are very easy, and can 
live almost every fall, you cannot practice that, 
so if you jusp from a little bit too high 
position, don't expect much, but to retry the 
level. 
 
Every block, or boulder in a game has a different 
markings. Like for example, the yellow ones are 
bricks you can push, and they will just as easily 
fall, and push, or not, the brick in front of it. 
The red ones will do the opposite, you cannot push 
them, and if the yellow, or any other brick hits 
it, it'll continue falling back to the other side. 
Some bricks explode when you push them, or other 
brick hits them, and that way they leave the hole, 
so your brick can continue spining, or yet again, 
not. Some spin without stop, 'til they hit some 
other brick that can fall, some replaces the 
spaces, like building a bridge on that place, some 
go high and when hit the top, they stick to it, 
and push, or not, the brick in front of them. 
Anyway, that's the game basics. 
 
Each level gives you the new code/password, so you 
can continue from the position where you ended 
each time you type that code. Perspective of your 
ant is like in any other platform game, and you 
control it with arrow keys, or joystick. But 
beware, the time is clicking, so you'll have to 
solve each level in a hurry.

Putty Squad (c) 1994 System 3 Software, Ltd. / 
Ocean Software Ltd. 
 
In this sequel to Putty, the Wizard's peoples have 
invaded Putty land, and it's up to you to head to 
the Wizard city of Klud and free your many POWs. 
The gameplay has less of a puzzle element than the 
original, and is more of a standard platform game 
- to whatever extent a game in which you can 
become an all-conquering Terminator Putty, must 
face pups throwing grenades at you, and can use 
Uncle Ted to play a tune to distract enemies can 
be seen as a 'standard' example of anything. 
 
You take control of the same amorphous blob as 
before, which has the ability to 'stretch' left 
and right (using this as a weapon which kills on 
contact) and to stretch upwards to make jumping 
easier. He can also explode himself and absorb 
other objects, even becoming them physically to 
gain an advantage. 
 
There are stars littered around the level, and 
collecting these upgrades Putty's abilities, 
starting with a super punch for 10 stars, going up 
to the Terminator ability for 40. 
 
The pups from the previous game are no longer on 
your side, and are out to get you. These have all 
manner of abilities - shooting mortar bombs at 
you, paradropping towards you, and even flying a 
helicopter.

multiple hits and when burnt Rex needs to kick 
them once more to destroy them or use his scream 
(hits everything on the screen). While playing Rex 
collects eggs, health, power-ups for his fire 
breath and scream refills. Checkpoints are shown

$bio
 
 
Ranma Nibunnoichi - Akanekodan Teki Hihou (c) Oct 
22, 1993 Rumic Soft / Toho Co.,Ltd. 
 
The game is based on the animé series Ranma 1/2. 
It tells the story of the young martial artist 
Ranma Saotome. Traveling with his father Genma 
across China, Ranma discovered a cursed spring. 
When he and his father fell into that spring, they 
were both transformed: Ranma into a little girl, 
Genma into a panda bear. Hot water restored them 
to their original appearance, but whenever they 
are splashed with cold water, they turn into their 
"cursed" forms. 
 
The story of the game begins as Ranma and Genma 
are having breakfast by their friends. Suddenly, 
several cat-like creatures burst in and kidnap 
Genma. Ranma finds out that the cats belonged to 
Akaneko (Crimson Cat) Gang, who kidnaps strong 
fighters for some reason. Soon Ranma discovers 
that Kamusaru, the leader of the Crimson Cat Gang, 
is looking for an ancient treasure that will allow 
him to turn into a Nekomaou (Cat Demon King), and 
take over the world. Ranma and his friends will do 
anything to rescue Genma and to stop Kamusaru's 
evil plans! 
 
The game features many characters from the animé, 
including Ranma's fiancee Akane, the fighter 
Ryouga, the amazon warrior Shampoo who is in love 
with Ranma, and others. The game is built like a 
traditional Japanese RPG: your party fights random 
enemies in turn-based combat viewed from a 
third-person, Final Fantasy-like perspective. In 
battles, you can attack physically, or use various 
offensive and defensive techniques, which consume 
"ki" (an equivalent of magic points). Not only 
Ranma and Genma, but also the other characters in 
your parties can take a different shape. You carry 
around a bucket of cold water, and every time you 
use it on one of your characters, he/she is 
transformed into a "cursed" form. This is 
sometimes required to advance the story of the 
game (for example, Ranma can enter a certain 
location only as a girl).

Ranma Nibunnoichi - Chougi Ranbu Hen (c) Apr 28, 
1994 Rumic Soft / Rumic Soft 
 
A 2D one-on-one fighting game based on the Ranma 
1/2 manga series dealing with the adventures of a 
male martial artist cursed to transform into a 
female version of himself when splashed with 
water. 
 
Ranma 1/2 : Chougi Ranbu Hen pits 12 characters 
from the series (including the male and female 
versions of Ranma) against each other in best 
2-out-of-3 rounds matches, with the goal being to 
defeat all the opponents and thus claim a magical 
lucky cat that will grant the champion whatever he 
wishes. 
 
Gameplay involves controlling your character in a 
2D scrolling arena, in which you attempt to defeat 
your opponent by using your basic attacks and 
special moves, all the while avoiding your 
opponent's strikes. You can also charge up your 
character until he reaches "super" mode, which 
allows you to unleash super moves for extra 
damage, but performing any basic attack negates 
the super mode. 
 
Features the standard single player and Vs modes 
along with a Tag Team Vs mode in which two players 
select a pair of characters and can exchange them 
in mid-fight for strategic advantage.

As in previous games the premise simply involves 
the cast of the series going at each other's 
throats for ultimate supremacy, although this time 
you can select any character in either the single 
player or Vs gameplay modes. 
 
The gameplay itself involves controlling your 
character in a side-scrolling arena and trying to 
defeat your opponent either with your basic 
attacks, special moves (triggered by specific 
controller motions) or super moves that require 
you to charge buttons and can only be dealt under 
specific situations (ie, when your life-bar starts 
flashing), while avoiding your opponent's attacks 
in turn.

Rapurasu no Ma (c) May 14, 1995 Humming Bird Soft

1924, the town Newcam, Massachusetts. On the 
outskirts of the town stands the Weathertop 
mansion. It was just an ordinary place until the 
last owner, Benedict Weathertop, started 
practicing black magic. He killed his parents and 
populated the mansion with all kinds of undead. 
Since then, nobody dared to approach the mansion. 
But a short while ago, two boys were found dead 
near this horrible place. Apparently, the boys had 
tried to enter the mansion. Another evidence 
pointed out that a girl followed them - but her 
body hasn't been found yet, and there is a slight 
hope she might be alive. 
This is where you, the hero of the game, decide to 
investigate the mystery, and to venture into the 
mansion... 
 
"Devil of Laplace" is a hybrid between survival 
horror and traditional Japanese RPG, similar to 
the pioneer of this genre,  Sweet Home for NES. 
Unlike "Sweet Home", this game has less puzzles 
and is more oriented towards RPG elements. You are 
not stuck in the mansion, but can leave it, visit 
the town, and buy supplies. Later you also visit 
other locations such as a castle, etc. The battles 
are random, turn-based, and are viewed from 
first-person perspective. The hero of the game can 
recruit three other characters to the party of 
five available. Each character (including the 
hero, to whom you assign gender and class) belongs 
to one of the five character classes: Dilettante, 
Medium, Detective, Scientist, or Journalist. 
Dilettante is an all-around character with 
defensive magic, Medium is a kind of a black mage, 
Detective is a melee fighter, Scientist can 
construct powerful machines to perform various 
techniques, and the Journalist can take pictures 
of the monsters, which is the only way to gain 
money in the game.

Rejoice - Aretha Oukoku no Kanata (c) Oct 16, 1992 
Japan Art Media / Yanoman Corporation 
 
This game is quite different not only from the 
GameBoy title  Aretha 3, but also from the first 
two Aretha games for the SNES. "Rejoice" is a 
semi-serious, semi-comical RPG that is only 
loosely connected to other Aretha games. The 
heroes of the game are four thieves who live in a 
small village, occasionally robbing people, and 
exploring ancient ruins in search for treasure. 
One day, a terrible flood drove the village 
inhabitants out of their houses, and one of the 
thieves, Treno, was washed away to a sea shore, 
near a forest. There, a mysterious old wizard 
found Treno, and the two ventured into the forest 
to find the way back home. As the plot thickens, 
the heroes discover that none else but the Demon 
King Howard is plotting an evil scheme, and they 
are the only ones who can stop him! 
 
Unlike other Aretha games, "Rejoice" is not a 
turn-based, but an action RPG. Monsters roam the 
game world, and you fight them by using weapons 
with elemental charges. You can pause the game at 
any time, access the menu, use items, and also 
switch characters. You can also jump, although 
this ability is not an integral part of the 
gameplay. You visit towns and can buy weapons, 
armor, and items in stores.

Several boss monsters per level. Level progress is

the corrals, through the rusty frontier town and 
to the stables, where you'll find the sheriff's 
horse to steal. 
 
During Robin Hoek, Ren is the finest archer in all 
of Logwood Forest. Armed with trusty bow and 
turkey baster, you must make your way through the 
village and rescue the fair Maid Moron from the

different levels of a firehouse to find these 
objects to proceed: a helmet, hose, pair of socks, 
rope, trampoline, uniform, and a beaver(!).  They 
all have to be placed on a fire truck before time 
runs out.  You can jump, climb up stairs and 
firepoles, and grab items while avoiding or 
putting out fires with water and eluding a speedy 
fireman by painting yourself like a dalmatian to 
avoid getting thrown out. 
 
A short 30 second bonus round follows where you 
must find Ren, the psychotic chihuahua.  This is 
followed by another 30 second round to bounce as 
many bags of Gritty Kitty Litter into a bin as you 
can. 
 
The second level has both Ren and Stimpy holding 
the trampoline to catch objects falling from a 
burning building.  Again, there is a time limit by 
which all items must be caught.  If successful, 
you return to the firehouse again the next day and 
must survive a week to gain the award of the 
Sacred Golden Fire Hydrant Helmets.

Rex Ronan - Experimental Surgeon (c) 1993 
Sculptured Software, Inc. / Health Hero Network,

This game comes at you with a Fantastic Voyage 
tale of a microsurgeon miniaturized to a 
near-microscopic scale in order to enter the body 
and save the life of a tobacco salesman, 
ironically laid low by health complications caused 
by the very cigarettes he sold.  Rex must be 
asking himself, "My parents put a mortgage on 
their house to put me through eight years of 
medical school just so I could scrub tar off 
someone's lungs like a window-washer?"  But it 
gets worse: Big Tobacco, pre-emptively attempting 
to silence the turnabout whistleblowing revelation 
they anticipate in the unlikely event of this 
salesman's recovery, have some shrinking 
technology of their own, and have introduced 
sinister nanobots into his body to ensure his -- 
and Rex's -- untimely demises. 
 
Washing off goo and attempting to survive the 
robot sprites' poor collision-detection routines 
comprise the large part of this game (albeit in 
exotic, well-rendered environments such as The 
Mouth, The Heart, The Lungs, and eventually The 
Brain -- where you struggle to clean up 
regenerating blobs of nicotine addiction)

Riddick Bowe Boxing (c) Jan, 1994 Malibu Games /

Riddick Bowe Boxing is another one of the many 
boxing games released at the time, but with subtle 
differences. The HUD contains damage and energy 
meters along with a miniature ring up the top of 
the screen, useful to see the player's position in 
the ring so as not to get backed into a corner 
real easily. 
 
Players can compete in the standard, 1-Player v. 
CPU, 1-Player v. 2-Player or even a career mode, 
where there are four preset fighters to choose 
from along with an option to create customers 
boxers. The career starts out at position #25 in 
the ranking and players slowly work up the ladder, 
going to the gym in between bouts to build up 
stats to eventually take on "Big Daddy" himself, 
Riddick Bowe. 
 
The game is practically a copy of Evander 
Holyfield's Real Deal Boxing, save for the 
graphics style and the included fighters.

the fact that you won't usually be able to find

or has the option to not hit in case of a ‘ball’.  
The player can also steal a base while batting. 
After the ball is hit the game goes into fielding 
mode where the camera shifts to a view that is 
lower than the normal 45 degree angle (the fielder 
gets smaller as he moves away from the camera). 
The player then controls the closest fielder to 
get or catch the ball and then throw it to the 
selected base. There are many different cameras 
angles that the game selects depending on the 
location of the ball. The camera can be on the 
left, center, or right side of the field in ether 
infield or outfield position and all cameras can 
pan to follow the ball. 
 
The player can use a password to save their 
progress in Regular Season mode. An exhibition 
match can be played in two player mode with the 
use of two controllers.

The sequel to Romance of the Three Kingdoms. The 
game concept is still the same, though they did 
improve a lot of features that one may consider 
'disturbing' from RTK I (e.g. Generals dying 
easily due to disease, etc.). RTK can be said to 
be much more 'stable' where players no longer have 
to worry that much about time length in the game, 
as the game take a slower time rate to allow the 
players to build up their forces without much 
interference. The RTK II gameplay and interface is 
closely similar to Nobunaga's Ambition II.

Romancing SaGa (c) Jan 28, 1991 Square Co., Ltd. / 
Square Co., Ltd. 
 
Once upon a time, three evil gods fought against 
the holy gods, and the holy God-Father chose a 
human warrior to help them. Finally, after a 
prolonged, terrible war, the leader of the three 
evil gods - Death, the eldest of them - 
surrendered. The youngest evil god, Schirach, 
became a human and has lost her powers. The middle 
one, Saruin, was sealed away in the dark world. 
Now, after thousand years have passed, and the 
seal of Saruin has weakened, it is time for you, 
the hero of the new generation, to defeat him. 
 
Romancing SaGa is the fourth installment in the 
long SaGa series - non-linear role-playing games 
with several main heroes. It is the first of three 
Super Nintendo entries. The first three games in 
the series were on the Gameboy and were known as 
"Final Fantasy Legend" outside of Japan. In this 
game, you play the stories of eight characters, 
which will later unite to face the ultimate evil. 
The eight characters belong to different classes 
and have different abilities. There are four male 
characters (noble son, thief, adventurer, and 
pirate), and four female ones (nomad, ranger, 
dancer, and savage). The combat is turn-based, 
with enemies visible on screen. Taking a cue from 
Final Fantasy II on the NES, instead of "Leveling" 
your character as a whole you level specific 
abilities such as a type of weapon or magic, as 
well as, stats such as HP and Strength and 
Intelligence. New to this entry abilities are 
randomly unlocked during battle as a light-bulb 
appears over the characters head and the new 
ability is unleashed to the surprise of friend and 
foe. This serendipitous element of gameplay along 
with the multiple heroes to choose from greatly 
enhance the replay value as no two playthroughs 
are alike. Which is good considering the steep 
learning curve of the SaGa games which require 
multiple playthroughs to truly master the system. 
 
"Romancing SaGa" was never released outside of 
Japan until the Playstation 2 remake "Romancing 
SaGa: Minstrel Song"

Romancing SaGa 2 (c) Dec 10, 1993 Square Co., Ltd. 
/ Square Co., Ltd. 
 
Long ago, seven noble warriors defeated the 
ultimate evil, and brought peace to the world. But 
the memory of the humans is short... wars begin, 
breaking the world's harmony, and now the world is 
threatened by seven demons. Emperor Leon of Avalon 
tries to rid the world of the demons. One day, he 
goes on a treasure hunt, accompanied by his son 
and heir, Gerard. But the emperor is slain by a 
horrible monster, and now Gerard, the child of 
royal blood, has to continue his work. 
 
In this game, you control the royal family of 
Avalon throughout several generations. Unlike the  
first game, where you could play eight different 
characters from the very beginning of the game, 
here you play various characters continuously, 
generation after generation. Each time the old 
emperor passes away, you'll have to choose a heir 
for him out of four candidates. The choice of 
those candidates depends on chance and on your 
decisions to recruit party members during your 
reign. You'll learn various techniques during the 
game and then assign them to your party members (a 
party contains five active characters). Characters 
can die permanently, i.e., become unavailable for 
the rest of the game, in case they lose their life 
points

Every 300 years the Death Eclipse kills all newly 
born creatures. Men, women, and children, animals 
and plants, even ferocious monsters - no one can 
survive the devastation caused by the Eclipse. No 
one except a child chosen by the destiny. 600 
years ago, such a child survived the Death 
Eclipse, only to become a demon king. During the 
next Eclipse, a chosen child became a holy king, 
and he defeated the evil demon king. Now, when the 
next Eclipse is nearing, nobody knows who the next 
fortunate survivor will become - a demon or a holy 
man? 
 
In "Romancing SaGa 3", you can play through the 
story controling any one of the eight main 
characters - Julian, Monica, Mikhael, Harid, 
Katarina, Thomas, Elena, and Sarah. The story is 
common for all eight characters, and they often 
join together and share the same piece of a story. 
The princess Monica learns about a rebellion 
planned by a treacherous Baron to dethrone her 
brother, Marquis Mikhael. She goes to warn him, 
but on her way, she loses her horse, and has to 
stop in an inn of the town Shinnon. There, she 
meets travelers who agree to lend her a horse and 
accompany her to see her brother. When they 
finally reach Mikhael, a war begins... 
 
"Romancing SaGa 3" has a refined upgrading system: 
you can upgrade your weapons and your spells by 
using them continuously. The party combat is 
turn-based, and there are also strategic 
army-vs.-army battles you'll have to command.

Rudra no Hihou (c) Apr 05, 1996 Square Co., Ltd. / 
Square Co., Ltd. 
 
The Earth is ruled by heavenly powers, who destroy 
it and create it again every 4000 years, to end 
the live of powerful races and to let new ones 
appear. Many years ago, four great races dominated 
the Earth: the wise Danans, the beautiful 
Mermaids, the proud Reptiles, and the strong 
Giants. But those races had to give place to a 
newly born race: the humans. During the era of the 
humans, the planet's air has become filled with 
smog and the water dirty with pollutants. The cult 
of the Rudra have appeared and begun fortelling 
the end of the world. As the 4000 year deadline 
approaches, three characters each embark on their 
separate yet intertwined quests. 
 
Sion is a young warrior who wants to take part in 
a ritual tournament and become the strongest of 
the kingdom. However a capture of one of the 
Cultists of Rudras soon complicates his training. 
 
Surlet is a wise magician who is interested in 
archeology and history of the Earth. He is also a 
pupil of the famous professor Muench who recently 
made a very important discovery regarding ancient 
ruins 
 
Riza is a young druid who lives with her 
grandfather in a quiet village. She was born with 
a mysterious jade on her forehead, and now feels 
the urge to save the world from an inevitable, yet 
unknown disaster. 
 
Rundra no Hiho is a turn-based RPG, similar in 
gameplay and graphics to the better known Final 
Fantasy VI. Whenever players load the game 
cartridge, they are able to  choose which of the 
three characters they wish to play. This allows 
any one of these quests to be saved and put aside 
for any amount of time, allowing the player to 
change between characters as they so desire. 
Regardless of which character is chosen, the game 
is displayed as a top-view on the overworld and in 
towns. Players can move around to different 
locations, search treasure chests and talk to 
townspeople. On the overworld and in dungeons, 
random encounters can occur. During battles the 
game is displayed from a side-view and is 
turn-based between the player's characters and 
monsters. Players are able to Fight with their 
weapon, use mantras (magic), use items, defend or 
run away. Defeat of monsters will result in the 
party earning experience points and money, which 
can be spent to buy new weapons, armor and items. 
 
The game's mantra (magic) system is unique in that 
all spells are formed up of syllables, each with 
it's own effect (for instance, the syllable "Ig" 
represents fire and the syllable "ga" augments any 
mantra's power over it's basic form. Therefore 
"Igga" is a more powerful version than "Ig" 
alone). Syllables must be arranged in proper 
combinations in order to form effective magic 
spells. Hints towards some of these combinations 
can be found inside treasure chests or by talking 
to townspeople.

Ruin Arm (c) Jun 23, 1995 Plex / Bandai Co., Ltd. 
 
"Ruin Arm" tells the story of a young boy named 
Arm, who lives together in Arff Village together 
with his father Borgan, his sister Linda, and the 
talking bird Lucia. Proud of the warrior 
traditions of their family, Borgan sends Arm to 
retrieve a powerful sword from the depths of the 
dungeon Arff. When Arm returns home, he finds the 
village attacked by soldiers from as hostile 
empire. His father loses his memory, and he has to 
find a magical herb to cure him. The king of 
Rondium and his court magician send Arm and Linda 
on a quest to find out more about the attack, and 
Arm discovers the secrets of the ancient Mediom 
empire and its evil emperor. 
 
This is an action RPG in which you control Arm and 
his party. You can either let the computer AI 
handle the actions of the other characters, or 
control them on your own, one at a time. In 
battles, characters have their own attacks: Arm 
uses physical attacks, Linda casts magic, etc. The 
dungeons are complex, and many of them have 
puzzles that you can solve by making two 
characters co-operate.

Bruford's previous achievement: Genetically 
enhanced warriors known as the Run Sabers. Two of 
the Run Sabers, Sheena and Allen are ready to

Run Saber is a side-scrolling platform game 
similar in gameplay to Strider. Players assume the

Choosing either Sheena with her Ice powers or 
Allen with his Thunder powers, players must defeat 
mutant monsters. The Run Sabers can move side to 
side, jump in the air, attack with a sword, climb 
along walls or roofs, slide across the ground and 
drop-kick. Additionally, each character has a 
special move, which damages everything on the 
screen with either Ice or Lightning, and which can 
be activated by collecting orb power-ups. Other 
power-ups include small health, large health, 
extra life and a larger sword. Players progress 
through 5 different levels, often encountering 
powerful boss and miniboss mutant creatures.

In "Sansara Naga 2", you can play as either a male 
or a female character. Ten years ago, the elder of 
the village Ryuen found you, a little child, near 
the village gate. Nobody knew where you came from, 
but in your hands you were holding an egg. This 
egg was carefully preserved, and now, after ten 
years, a dragon has hatched from it - a white 
dragon who can talk! It became clear that you are 
one of the legendary Dragonriders. Now the Elder 
has a new task for you. The Dragonrider Amrita, 
who has been taking good care of you during those 
ten years, has betrayed the Guild, set the Guild's 
warehouse on fire, and fled Ryuen with her dragon. 
It is your mission to locate her, to bring her 
back, and to find out why she disappeared. 
 
You travel to eight different worlds, learning 
more about the legendary race of dragons and their 
dragonriders. You can recruit dragons to your 
party. Each dragon has a unique ability - one can 
swim, another one can use magic, etc. The regular 
enemies are random, and you fight them in 
turn-based combat viewed form first-person 
perspective.When you defeat a monster, you have a 
choice of either feeding your dragon with it (it 
restores the dragons' hit points), or carrying it 
with you and then selling it in a town. Your 
weapons can wear off if you use them a lot. At 
some point you can also buy pigs and then cook 
them to produce healing items.

SeaQuest DSV (c) Jan, 1995 Sculptured Software, 
Inc. / Malibu Games 
 
Based on the first season of the TV series of the 
same name, your character is an officer of the 
UEO: The United Earth Oceans Organization. You 
begin the game inside a training simulation, which 
upon successful completion ensures your transfer 
to the crew of the seaQuest DSV where you will be 
called upon to perform the same duties. 
 
Primarily, your function is to navigate the 
seaQuest Deep Submergence Vessel around the 
underwater map to various 'mission areas' where 
you will be called upon to use the on board 
vehicles to accomplish some task. Typical missions 
include salvage operations, rescue operations, 
disarmament of underwater explosives, termination 
of enemies and exploration. Damage of underwater 
property is deducted from your budget and 
completion of objectives adds to it. The money 
must be used to resupply weapons and buy 
additional vehicles. Underwater is a dangerous 
place. 
 
The vehicles you have at your command include 
 
1. Speeder: A simple two-man vessel designed 
   entirely for speed. It is also a combat vessel 
   and may fire forwards, move up & down and 
   change orientation between facing left and 
   facing right 
2. Stinger: A prototype "next generation" 
   attack vessel, this one-man sub allows you to 
   orientate in any direction to fire your weapon 
   accurately. 
3. Sea Crab: A slow vehicle used for 
   excavation, mining, and rescue missions. It is 
   the only vessel that can dock with other 
   vessels and one of only two that can pick up 
   undersea objects for transport. It comes with a

   torpedoes and mines which may be dropped behind 
   it. Furthermore it can also pick up undersea 
   objects for transport

   agile of the vehicles, and may take off in 
   bursts of speed. However Darwin has no weapons 
   with which to defend himself and is very 
   vulnerable. Darwin is able to get into tiny 
   spaces that none of the other vehicles can 
   reach. Darwin is able to activate switches.

Secret of Evermore (c) Oct, 1995 Square Soft, Inc. 
/ Square Soft, Inc. 
 
You start out as a nameless boy and his dog, 
literally from the town of Podunk.  You chase the 
dog into an old abandoned mansion, where a 
scientist lived 30 years ago.  Some of his 
equipment is still operational, and when your dog 
chews on it, you're both sent to the strange world 
of Evermore.  Now you must try to get back. 
The action-RPG gameplay is very much like Secret 
of Mana, with a few key changes.  Multiplayer is 
out.  Rather than three characters, there are just 
the two.  The equivalent of magic is alchemy, 
where each effect requires several base 
ingredients which you gather as you go along.

Secret of Mana (c) Oct, 1993 Square Co., Ltd. / 
Square Soft, Inc. 
 
Once upon a time, the power of Mana was used by 
all people and helped their civilization grow. But 
as evil forces took control of Mana Fortress, 
there was no way out but a war which destroyed the 
Mana-based civilization but eventually brought 
peace to people. The events of the past became but 
legends to the new generation of humans. But 
history repeats itself... One day, a young village 
boy finds a rusty sword stuck at the bottom of a 
river. He doesn't know this sword is the famous 
Mana sword, the one that won so many battles 
before. By drawing the sword out of the river 
bottom, the boy unwillingly summons hordes of 
monsters, and is expelled from his village. A 
mysterious knight Jema is the only man who helps 
him and gives him instructions for the future. 
First, he must repair the sword, and then, with 
its help, take control of Mana seeds which can be 
found in eight great castles. 
 
"Secret of Mana" is an action RPG, featuring 
real-time hack-and-slash type of a combat. Like in 
Quest for Glory games, you have a stamina gauge. 
The more stamina you have, the more powerful your 
strike is. You upgrade your weapons and abilities 
and meet many different types of monsters, while 
roaming around the country and performing your 
quests.

Secret of the Stars (c) Jul, 1995 Tecmo, Ltd. /

You are a young boy named Ray, who lives with his 
foster-father in a small country house on an 
island. But he can not enjoy his idyllic life for 
a long time. Ray is told about the evil wizard 
Homncruise (yes, that's the name) who plans to 
conquer the world. Defeating Homncruise won't be 
easy: first Ray must find the magic crest of his 
fallen father, and build a strong team of 
legendary warriors, named Aquitallion. Only then 
will he and his comrades be ready to face 
Homncruise and to save the world. 
 
In this game you wander around the world map. 
visiting towns and dungeons, and fighting monsters 
in turn-based combat viewed from first-person 
perspective, much like in Dragon Quest games. 
You'll have two parties at your disposal, and will 
be able to switch between them at any time. One 
party is the Aquitallion, the "main" one, and the 
only one which can access plot-progressing areas. 
The other parties can be used for visiting 
dungeons and retrieving valuable items. At a 
certain point in the game, you'll also be able to 
build and to manage your own town.

Seiken Densetsu 3 (c) Sep 30, 1995 Square Co., 
Ltd. / Square Co., Ltd. 
 
Seiken Densetsu 3 is set in the same world as the 
two previous Seiken Densetsu games (the first is 
Final Fantasy Adventure, and the second is most 
known as Secret of Mana). The mysterious power of 
Mana is also the center of all events in Seiken 
Densetsu 3. Years have passed, and all the 
destructive powers of Mana have been securely 
sealed by Mana Swords into eight seeds, all placed 
in eight different kingdoms. But some people know 
about those sealed powers, and they don't want to 
free them for the sake of humanity, but for their 
own gain - such as the kingdom of Altena, which is 
slowly freezing and which can be saved only by the 
legendary powers. 
 
The game features several plot lines connected to 
each other by their common background. In the 
beginning of the game, you are offered to choose a 
group of three among six different characters of 
different classes: Duran the Fighter, Angela the 
Magic User, Lisa the Amazon, Carlie the Cleric, 
Kevin the Grappler and Hawk the Thief. Each one of 
them has her/his own background story and dwells 
in a different land. Gradually, the connections 
between those different characters become 
apparent, and the seemingly loose story lines are 
connected into a whole. 
 
Seiken Densetsu 3, like the previous game of the 
series, is an action RPG, with real time combat.

Sengoku Denshou (c) 1993 SNK Corporation / Data 
East Corporation 
 
A 2D side-scrolling beat 'em up, Sengoku casts you 
and a friend as two renegade fighters out to beat 
the crap out of the many assorted gangs that 
threaten the post-apocalyptic cities of the 
future. Unfortunately for them they also get 
caught in a time-warping scheme caused by the evil 
Nobunaga who attempts to invade the time period 
with mythical warriors and evil creatures from the 
Japanese sengoku period. 
 
The game thus takes you from the city to a 
spirit-realm from time to time, in which you must 
fight all sorts of Japanese mythical figures, and 
release three haunted spirits that can aid you in 
your battle. Collecting orbs from defeated enemies 
allows you heal up, gain weapons and even energy 
attacks and also summon the warrior forms of the 
spirits you released, which change your 
character's form and give you a new collection of 
attacks and powers.

Shadowrun (c) Nov 01, 1993 Beam Software Pty., 
Ltd. / Data East Corporation 
 
The SNES version of Shadowrun appeared earlier 
than the Genesis one, and it is an entirely 
different game, with different story and gameplay, 
although it is also based on a pen-and-paper RPG 
of the same name. Your hero, Jake, is attacked by 
assassins, and appears to be dead. However, a 
mysterious dog approaches his lifeless body, 
transforms into a woman, and casts a spell on 
him... After that Jake wakes up in the morgue. He 
doesn't know what happened to him, he doesn't even 
remember his own name. Wandering through the 
futuristic city, where monorails, computers, and 
street gangs armed with automatic weapons co-exist 
with orcs, dwarves, and vampires, you begin to 
discover the mystery and to learn about the 
dangers awaiting you around every corner. 
 
Shadowrun for SNES is a skill-based RPG that uses 
real time combat. You can hire "deckers", i.e., 
temporary party members, but the main focus of the 
gameplay is on Jake and his abilities and skills. 
There are no random battles, but many screens with 
respawning enemies, where you can earn experience 
points and upgrade your skills. The experience 
points are called "karma" in this game. You need 
to gain karma in order to advance in one of the 
several skills available to you. You'll also be 
able to buy skills from people. The skills include 
firearms, computers, negotiation, leadership, and 
many others. You can also use the gained karma 
points to upgrade basic stats like hit points or 
charisma.

Shien's Revenge is a first-person Operation 
Wolf-style shooter that puts the player in the 
role of Shien the ninja. Movement is automatically 
controlled by the game, which scrolls horizontally

long-range shuriken (throwing stars) and a 
close-range dagger in order to defeat various 
enemy ninjas and creatures that appear on the 
screen. A set of candles indicate the player's 
life meter. Power-ups such as rapid fire and 
scrolls can be picked up by defeating enemies. The 
use of scrolls produces a powerful attack that 
damages everything on the screen. At the end of 
each area, the player encounters a boss who must 
be defeated through the depletion of its life

A young man lives together with his mother in 
Kichijoji, a district in modern Tokyo. One day, he 
has a strange dream: he is being sucked into 
another dimension, a strange maze-like structure. 
A spirit appears in front of him and asks him his 
name. As he proceeds further, he meets a man who 
is hanging on a cross, another one who is being 
tormented by a demon, and a mysterious young woman 
who is bathing in a pool... 
 
"Wake up!" - the voice of his mother cuts through 
the dream. The young man wakes up and checks his 
computer. Suddenly, a message arrives: the world 
is headed towards destruction. Only he who can 
summon demons through a virtual space will be able 
to prevent a disaster. What could that mean? The 
young man goes outside and finds out a murder has 
occurred in the nearby park. The district must be 
cut off from the rest of the city until the 
murderer is found. This was the beginning of the 
demon summoner's story... 
 
"Shin Megami Tensei" is a first-person RPG set in 
modern-day and futuristic Tokyo. The hero of the 
game can summon demons, who use a mysterious 
energy called Magnetite. The demons can fight for 
you and perform other useful tasks. The 
first-person combat is turn-based. In the 
beginning of the game, you can set the statistics 
of your party members, determining their strength, 
stamina, intelligence, etc. You'll need to make 
some crucial decisions during the game, that will 
also influence the outcome of its events.

A tranquil day, like most days. Even boring, like

If... it was destroyed? If... this school was 
thrown into a separate world? This is the story of 
boys and girls who were suddenly thrust into the 
Demon World 
and are now lost... 
 
"Shin Megami Tensei If..." is a follow-up to the 
two classic SNES games. You choose your main 
character in the beginning of the game (by default 
it is the girl Tamaki, a character from the future 
 Persona series). Something weird is happening in 
the perfectly ordinary Karukozaka high school. One 
of the students made contact to a different 
universe that co-exists with modern-day Japan. 
With the help of your fellow students, you must 
investigate the matter and stop the insane plans 
of the student. 
 
The gameplay contains typical Megami Tensei 
features such as demon summoning, demon fusion, 
and the ability to talk to enemies before (or 
instead of) fighting them. Enemies will react 
differently depending on your approach during 
conversation. The battles utilize a turn-based 
engine.

Shin Megami Tensei II (c) Apr 18, 1994 Atlus Co., 
Ltd. / Atlus Co., Ltd. 
 
Shin Megami Tensei II is a direct sequel to the  
first game. The events of this game take place 20 
or 30 years after the hero of the first game 
followed the neutral path, defeated the Asura Lord 
and the seraph Michael at the Cathedral, and 
founded a state where followers of both Law and 
Chaos ideals could live freely. But his reign of 
freedom doesn't last long. The Mesia faith gains 
power, expanding the Cathedral into a new enclosed 
environment named Millenium. The Gaians rise up, 
but their rebellion is repressed by the Mesians' 
elite warrior class, the Temple Knights. Some 
years later, a retired arena fighter Okamoto 
discovers a man fighting for his life against a 
demon. He rescues the man, who doesn't even 
remember his own name, and trains him to fight in 
the arena so they might both go on to a better 
living in one of the upper-class areas of 
Millenium. And thus the new battle for a better 
future begins... 
 
"Shin Megami Tensei II" features all the gameplay 
innovations of the previous game. You can summon 
demons, fuse them, make them battle for you, talk 
to random enemies and receive information from 
them, etc. The combat is turn-based, and you 
explore the dungeons from a first-person 
perspective view.

folk tale. When he grew up, he defeated the evil 
demons from the Demon Island, and three years 
later found a way to save his land from the wrath 
of Emma, the King of Hell. But a new threat has 
appeared now! The demonic king Basara sends his 
henchman Karura to the moon, to kidnap 
Kaguya-hime, the legendary Moon Princess, in order 
for her to marry his son, Prince Daida. Momotarou 
prepares his magic carriage and flies to the moon, 
attempting to rescue Kaguya-hime. But he doesn't 
suspect how strong his foes really are... 
 
The sequel to the first two Momotarou Densetsu 
games is very similar to its predecessors in terms 
of gameplay. Moving around Momotarou and his party 
members over the world map (which has become 3D by 
now), you visit towns, buy weapons and 
accessories, talk to people, and fight random 
enemies and bosses in turn-based combat viewed 
from first person perspective.

Another beat 'em up in the Nekketsu Kouha 
Kunio-Kun series. 
The eternal rebel Kunio and his pal Riki finally 
get to face the long arm of the law when they get 
both arrested for killing a couple of bystanders 
in a hit-and-run incident. Problem is they are 
innocent and   the lookalike killers are still out 
there! Kunio and his pal now have to break out of 
the prison and go kick some butt in the name of 
justice (and to clear their names of course). 
 
Gameplay involves defeating all opponents using 
your arsenal of attacks and special moves (as well 
as any weapons you may find around) and completing 
the many side scrolling stages that make up the 
game, usually after beating an end level boss. 
 
Kunio and Riki are not alone in their quest, as 
their hard boiled girlfriends, Misako and Kyouko, 
can join up and provide their unique collection of 
special moves to the mix. Biking sequences in 
which you try to get to another part of town while 
fending-off opponents  Road Rash-style are also 
added for additional gameplay and the game uses 
several non-interactive cutscenes and dialogues to 
carry the plot forward.

Technos Japan Corp. / Technos Japan Corp. 
 
First next-gen entry in the Nekketsu Kouha 
Kunio-kun brawler series. The story this time 
deals with the Nekketsu High gang making a field 
trip to Osaka. However rebel student Kunio and his 
pal Riki do a little more than sightseeing and get 
tangled up with the local Yakuzas so now its a 
battle for survival if they want to get out of the 
city alive. 
 
Gameplay-wise the game follows the already 
familiar beat 'em up/RPG hybrid template for the 
series, in which you control your character as he 
battles his way through side scrolling levels with 
a collection of attacks and special moves. These 
special moves can be acquired by collecting 
special items and your character gains experience 
for defeating enemies which allows you to upgrade 
his stats when leveling up. The battles are 
somewhat more chaotic as they are now staged as 
distinct waves that must be cleared before you can 
continue to scroll down the level, in each of 
these waves you'll face not only opposing gang 
members, but also neutral characters, policemen 
and other assorted NPCs that can fight on your 
side, against you, or simply ignore you depending 
on your behavior. 
 
New features in Shodai-NKKK include branching 
plot-points that lead you to different challenges 
and even alternate endings as well as completely 
reworked graphics to take advantage of the 16-bit 
SNES which now feature a more realistically 
proportioned character design.

Side Pocket (c) Dec, 1993 Data East Corporation / 
Data East Corporation 
 
The main objective is to cross different USA 
cities and reach the predetermined scores to go 
ahead. But remember: you'll have only 16 balls and 
every error can be lethal! 
 
The game also comes with modes for 2 players with 
two variants: 2P Pocket Game (the traditional 
mode) and 2P 9-Ball Game, where the premise is to 
sink 9 balls before the other player makes them 
first. If you prefer, test your target in Trick 
Game or even hear your favorite song in Jukebox. 
 
After each stage completed (and some luck), a 
bonus stage will appear, as well as the chance to 
earn extra balls. You will only need a good target 
in the parquet block!

Sim City (c) Aug 01, 1991 Maxis Software Inc. / 
Nintendo of America Inc. 
 
SimCity sets you as the mayor of a new 
municipality, with the responsibility of building 
and maintaining a place where citizens can move to 
and work and be happy. The first task is to place 
essentials such as housing, transport links, 
schools, factories and shops. There are 50 types 
of these, allowing for homes of all standards and 
different types of businesses. Make sure to 
consider which sites are effective for which 
tasks. Some power sources pollute, others don't 
but are more expensive. Taxes must be raised to 
ensure an income, and then portions allocated to 
public services such as policing and roads. 
Earthquakes, floods and fires are all emergency 
situations that must be dealt to contain any 
damage. 
 
Successful mayoring will cause the small village 
to grow into a town, then a city and finally a 
metropolis. As the city's size grows so do it's 
needs. Commercial buildings may suddenly find that 
they need an airport to expand trade, or housing 
may find itself changing rapidly as vast amounts 
of people come and leave. 
 
The game also includes 8 pre-defined time-limited 
scenarios, with specific challenges and targets. 
The environment varies in each game (especially if 
you have the Terrain Editor add on), and this 
should affect your choices.

Sink or Swim (c) 1994 Zeppelin Games Limited / 
Titus France SA 
 
Your name is Kevin Codner – rescue mariner 
extraordinaire, answering the distress call of a 
sinking cruise liner, the SS Lucifer. You set off 
in your little submarine and board the ship where 
a horde of passengers desperately need your keen 
oversight and "shipsmarts". 
 
In 60 levels you have to rescue as many passengers 
(dubbed the Dim Passengers) as possible. At the 
beginning the passengers fall through a tube in 
the level. Similar to Lemmings you have to find a 
way for the passengers to the exit of the level. 
In order to do so, you must blast hindrances such 
cargo boxes and bulkheads with bombs or, when no 
bombs are left, reposition the boxes with a crane. 
There are also conveyor belts in the levels. If 
the belt moves in the wrong way, the passengers 
either can't use it or may even be transported to 
their dooms, being dropped off into water, fire or 
steam jets. You can usually choose the direction 
of the belts by pulling a lever. 
 
There are several types of scenarios that Kevin 
Codner (you) are faced with throughout the game. 
Of course the puzzles get progressively more 
difficult, involving things like patching up 
cracked pipes to stop a lethal jet of steam from 
cooking the distressed passengers. You can blast 
away obstacles and stack crates in creative 
manners. For instance, you can have them fall onto 
each other to form a bridge across a gap or to 
provide shielding from fire. This is usually done 
by hoisting them onto conveyor belts using a 
crane. 
 
Each level has a certain "save limit", meaning you 
have to save at least a certain amount of 
passengers. This again is akin a bit towards 
Lemmings, and lots of levels have a built-in time 
limit, represented be water pouring into the 
compartment, rising ominously. When the water 
rises high enough, the passengers will get carried 
along with it, and they can only swim for a short 
period of time before getting exhausted and 
drowning, so you'd better be on time with some 
assistance. 
 
At the end of each level you receive a password 
(again, Lemmings-style) so that you may pick up 
your game from the current level without having to 
progress through them all from the get-go.

Skuljagger - Revolt of the Westicans (c) 1992 
Realtime Associates, Inc. / American Softworks 
Corporation 
 
The pirate Sküljagger and his crew hold the island 
of Westica hostage. Forcing the people who live 
there to be his slaves, Sküljagger rules unopposed 
with an iron fist. A brave sailor named Storm 
Jaxon decides to rebel and steal Sküljagger's 
magical sword. Now he must fight for his life and 
ultimately to free the Westican people. 
 
Sküljagger: Revolt of the Westicans is a 
sidescrolling platform game. Players select 
between a 1 player game, an alternating turn 2 
player game or Bubblegum Practice. The player 
controls Storm Jaxon who is able to run left and 
right, jump and swing Sküljagger's magic sword. 
Storm must reach the end of each level before time 
runs out or risk losing a life. Under normal 
circumstances, touching an enemy or projectile 
will cause him to die, though the sword is often 
able to destroy projectiles. By collecting red 
jewels, Storm is able to both augment the sword 
with a projectile attack and be protected from one 
enemy attack. Green jewels will also protect from 
one enemy attack, however collecting 25 of them 
will grant an extra life. Blue jewels add 
additional time for Storm to complete each level. 
Finding a mask will make Storm invulnerable for a 
short time. These power-ups are either floating in 
the air of each level or hidden away in chests, 
boxes, rocks and coconuts. However these items 
which may hide items can also be picked up and 
thrown at enemies. 
 
In addition to the power-ups listed above, fruity 
bubblegum can also be found. Only one bubble gum 
flavor can be carried at a time and it will be 
held until the player activates it. Grape 
bubblegum encases Storm in a giant invulnerable 
bubble that can bounce higher than jumping alone. 
Cherry bubblegum will require the player to 
inflate manually, but will allow Storm to fly. 
Beware as over inflating the bubble will pop it. 
Watermelon bubblegum will turn Storm into a 
projectile that damages anything on the screen, 
also gathering items. Orange bubblegum will let 
Storm spit out pellets at enemies which will 
destroy them. Bubblegum power-ups can be tested in 
the special bubblegum practice option of the menu.

Slayers (c) Jun 24, 1994 BEC Co., Ltd. / Banpresto 
Co., Ltd. 
 
"Slayers" is based on an manga series of the same 
name (also known as Lina the Teenage Sorceress). 
The heroine of the manga (and of the game) is Lina 
Inverse, a seventeen-year-old girl who can use 
magic and is also proficient with the sword. Lina 
particularly likes money, and often robs rich 
people and hunts for treasure. She also has a 
sense for justice - if a village or a town is in 
trouble, Lina will do anything to protect it and 
to fight the bad guys! In the game, Lina is 
knocked down after a fight against mysterious 
attackers, and is found by the inhabitants of the 
nearby village. The trouble is, she can't remember 
anything! When she meets her long-time companion 
Naga, their first objective become to investigate 
the goblin attacks on the population, but Lina's 
ultimate quest is to regain her memory and to find 
out who or what has attacked her. 
 
The game is a traditional console-style RPG with 
towns, dungeons, random enemies, and turn-based 
combat viewed from first-person perspective, in a 
Dragon Warrior fashion. The characters can attack 
physically or use special attacks. Lina can also 
cast various magical spells. You cannot travel on 
the world map, but "jump" to various locations 
instead. The game features animé-style cut scenes.

Smurfs 2, The (c) 1996 Virtual Studio / Infogrames 
Europe SA 
 
Night falls at the Smurf Village. Inquisitive 
Smurf brings Smurfette along to Papa Smurfs' 
laboratory to see the Magic Crystal that allows 
them to travel to anywhere in the world, but 
suddenly Smurfette breaks it, and they are gone! 
Now they must face the challenges in all 
continents in order to retrieve all shards of the 
Crystal and return home. 
 
A classic platformer, this title allows the player 
to choose between Inquisitive Smurf and Smurfette 
(there are no differences between characters) and 
collect all 10 shards scattered on the playfield.  
There is a larger emphasis on exploring the levels 
rather than killing enemies (no score is given for 
them), so they can be avoided in most occasions, 
but if the needs arise, be dealt with a kick or in 
Mario fashion by jumping over them. Some shards 
can only be obtained by jumping on an enemy, using 
the sprint jump or using the scenario (ropes, or 
vines). While large falls don't harm the Smurfs, 
improper contact with enemies does. Each 1-up has 
four hearts, and at the fifth contact a life is 
lost and the player must restart the level. Once 
all lives are lost, the game is over - there are 
no continues. To fill the meter there are hearts 
and small Smurf icons scattered or hidden 
somewhere in the level, and on all stages there's 
a key that unlocks a bonus level if all three are 
collected at the end of the continent. In these 
bonus levels the player collects as much objects 
as possible which translate into hearts when the 
time closes. If the player fills the meter, a 1-up 
is awarded.

Soul Blazer (c) 1992 Quintet Co., Ltd. / Enix 
Corporation 
 
You have been called by the Master to restore life 
to the Friel empire.  The ruler, King Magridd, 
struck a deal with the evil Deathtoll - in 
exchange for the soul of one living being, 
Deathtoll will give him a piece of gold.  
Magridd's greed got the better of him, and, 
thinking of the millions of souls of every living 
creature around the world, readily agreed to the 
deal.  But Magridd himself has since disappeared, 
and the the land is now devoid of life - instead 
only filled with Deathtoll's monstrous minions.  
Will you be able to save Friel's subjects from 
their horrible fate? 
 
Soul Blazer is an action RPG in the top-down style 
of The Legend of Zelda.  Like Zelda, battles are 
not turn-based - the player directly attacks 
enemies and dodges them.  As they progress, they 
also unlock special items which allows them to 
complete tasks for characters or access special 
areas (such as the Dream Rod, which transports you 
into someone's - or something's - dream).  Unlike 
Zelda, the game has an experience meter, and the 
player levels up and becomes stronger as they 
defeat enemies.  The game's unique hook is that 
there are "Monster Lairs" spread all over the land 
of Friel.  When they destroy all the enemies in a 
lair, they don't come back, and when they step on 
the empty lair, it restores part of the game 
world, bringing back anything from plants, to 
animals, to people, to buildings and more.  Each 
restored soul helps in some way - for example, the 
player can climb regrown ivy to reach new areas, 
reunite families by bringing back husband and 
wife, rebuild cities by restoring architects, and 
talk to characters to complete even more quests. 
 
The player's main goal is to find six Stones, 
which allow them to gain access to the World of 
Evil, where Deathtoll resides.  These stones are 
guarded by key characters in different parts of 
the world, usually the rulers, who require the 
player to defeat a boss character to rescue them.  
While most of the game allows them to progress in 
a linear fashion, there are certain souls that can 
only be restored by killing monsters that can't be 
harmed with their earlier weapons.  The player 
will need to find special weaponry and then 
backtrack to previous areas to rescue these souls. 
 It's also advisable to revisit previous 
locations, as certain characters may have new 
sidequests to complete which can reward them with 
new items to make them even stronger.

Space Ace (c) May, 1994 Oxford Digital Enterprises 
Ltd. / Absolute Entertainment, Inc. 
 
Borf has kidnapped Dexter's girlfriend Kimberly 
and is threatening to turn earth's population into 
babies using his "Infanto Ray". Naturally, Dexter 
cannot let this happen and sets out to stop Borf 
and rescue Kimberly. 
 
While following the same story as the Laserdisc 
conversions, the SNES version of Space Ace 
obviously lacks the long video sequences of the 
original, and also features different gameplay. 
 
Instead of only pushing the right button at the 
right moment, the player has complete control over 
Dexter. Most of the time, he will be busy jumping 
over chasms and dodging alien attacks, but 
occasionally, an 'energize'-symbol will appear 
which, by pressing the correct button in time, 
will temporarily transform Dexter into his 
stronger alter ego and enable him to shoot at his 
enemies. 
 
Once he boards his space ship, Dexter has to find 
his way out of a labyrinthine seen from a top-down 
perspective, destroying obstacles with the ship's 
laser and avoiding collisions. 
 
In order to retain the atmosphere of the original, 
the SNES version features a large number of 
(short) death animations and the platformer levels 
always follow the exact same sequence, which 
results in a trial&error-style gameplay somewhat 
similar to the original.

Space Football - One on One (c) 1992 Argonaut 
Software Ltd.|B.I.T.S., Ltd. / Triffix 
Entertainment Inc. 
 
In the futuristic sports game Space Football, 2 
players steering hovercrafts try to score 
touchdowns on each other by picking up and 
carrying a hoverball into a touchdown area. The 
hovercraft has the ability to accelerate, reverse, 
track the hoverball, and it can also fire at the 
opposing player to make him drop the ball if he's 
carrying it. If the player's hovercraft picks up 
the hoverball, they must try to get to the 
touchdown area within four seconds or else the 
hoverball gets automatically fumbled. Each game is 
played for a duration of 500 time units and the 
player with the highest score when the time runs 
out is declared the winner. 
 
The playfield itself presents features that can 
affect the way the match is played. Some 
playfields contain things such as jumps, spinners, 
and force arrows which can help or hinder a 
players movement. 
 
There are a total of 12 drivers to choose from, 
with 4 per every speed level (slow, medium, and 
high).

Sparkster (c) 1994 Konami Co., Ltd. / Konami 
(America), Inc. 
 
Sparkster is a 2D side-scrolling platformer 
starring the eponymous hero who previously 
appeared in Rocket Knight Adventures. It is very 
different from the contemporary Genesis title 
Sparkster, as it does not continue the story from 
the first game and has completely different 
levels, enemies and gameplay mechanics. In that 
way it can be considered a spin-off in the series. 
The introduction merely shows how an elderly man 
captures a girl and takes her into his airship. At 
that point Sparkster appears and he decides to 
chase them. 
 
Sparkster is a rodent carrying a rocket pack on 
his back. He can move around, duck, jump and hang 
from branches or rails. His regular attack is a 
sword slash that sends out a circular projectile. 
Through the L and R buttons he can dash left and 
right in a circle of fire. Keeping the attack 
button pressed powers up a rocket meter. When 
full, different types or actions can be performed: 
dashing left, right or up to cover a large 
distance, ricocheting off walls in a diagonal 
motion, or a stationary attack. 
 
The game consists of nine levels of which the last 
two can only be accessed on higher difficulty 
levels. Sparkster collects diamonds for points, 
defeats all types of robot enemies and collects 
apples to restore his heart meter near the top of 
the screen. Most of the game consists of regular 
platforming gameplay, with a few diversions where 
Sparkster rides a robot bird, or is shown from a 
top-down view flying in the air like a 
vertically-scrolling shooter. All levels have a 
level boss along with a large number of mid-level 
bosses. The game supports a password system.

In a small Mexican village, all the mice were 
enjoying a fiesta until Los Gatos Bandidos, a

Slowpoke escaped and sent for his cousin, the 
fastest mouse in Mexico... Speedy Gonzales!

enter each level and try to rescue as many mice as 
possible while chasing after cheese and avoiding 
natural hazards. Ariba! Ariba! 
 
The gameplay in Speedy Gonzales resembles the 
Sonic the Hedgehog series of games more than 
anything else. For the most part Speedy will run, 
run across fields and up slopes and into tunnels. 
There are also mousetraps which function similarly 
to Sonic's trampolines and will propel Speedy into 
the air. Speedy has a short range kick for 
attacking and can occasionally pick up items and 
use them at a later time.

details, such as Approval Rating: people like or 
dislike each other and their behavior towards 
Ratix and within the party might change depending 
on their feelings to him and your own actions. The 
combat is fast-paced, real-time: you control 
Ratix, while other party members are 
AI-controlled. You can customize combat tactics by 
assigning roles to your comrades, and you can 
pause the combat at any time to make strategic 
decisions.

Star Trek - The Next Generation - Future's Past 
(c) 1994 Spectrum Holobyte, Inc. / Spectrum 
Holobyte, Inc. 
 
The Romulans request permission to enter the 
Neutral Zone in order to search for a team of 
their researchers that they claim has gone 
missing. The USS Enterprise is sent to monitor 
their activities and find out their real motives. 
 
Gameplay is divided into three parts: commanding 
the Enterprise from the bridge, controlling an 
away team on a planetary mission and combat with 
other ships. 
 
From the bridge you can control all of the ships 
main functions. Conn: Set course to a different 
planet or sector. Communication:  Communicate: 
with other ships. Sensors: Receive information on 
your surroundings or planets you are orbiting. 
Computer: Access a database that contains lots of 
information on planets, races, technology, your 
crew etc. Engineering: If the Enterprise got 
damaged during combat, you can use this command to 
allocate resources to the different parts of the 
ship that need to be repaired. Briefing Room: 
Receive orders and information on your current 
mission. Tactical Station: Engage in combat. 
Transporter: Assemble an away team and beam it 
down to a planet (which is only possible if your 
current mission requires it). 
 
Before starting an away mission, you have to 
assemble a team of four crew members that differ 
in strength and in tactical and technical ability. 
Some crew members also have special abilities, Dr. 
Crusher can heal other crew members, Geordi and 
Data can see in the dark and Data can survive 
without air. Away missions are shown from a 
top-down perspective and you can control each team 
member individually or order different members to 
follow your currently selected character around. 
Most away missions are a mixture of simple (real 
time) combat and puzzle solving that usually 
consists getting hints from tricorder readings and 
finding objects that have to be used in the 
correct way. 
 
Ship battles are also seen from a top-down 
perspective and let you attack enemy ships with 
phasers and photon torpedoes, while keeping an eye 
or your shields and trying to dodge you enemy's 
torpedoes. If your ship too heavily damaged you 
can surrender and hope that your enemy spares you. 
 
While the SNES and Genesis versions are 
essentially the same games, there are some 
noticeable differences. The Genesis version plays 
considerably faster during ship battles and on 
away missions as well as on the bridge (meaning it 
takes much less time to repair the ship). There 
are many graphical differences and the map layout 
for away missions is slightly different from the 
SNES version as well.

(against a CPU-controlled drone) modes. 
 
You have a limited number of 
automatically-targeting missiles as well as a 
cannon. A tracking map tells you where you are on 
the level, and where the enemies are.Contact with

Street Combat is a one-on-one 2D fighting game in

crime-fighters from all across the globe decide to 
compete against each other in a street fighting 
tournament for fame and glory. 
 
Single player mode allows you to choose between

then takes you through 7 best 2-out-of-3 matches 
against a collection of different martial artists. 
A 2-player Vs mode allows you to freely select any 
of the characters without restrictions. 
 
Gameplay is similar to other one-on-one beat 'em

New characters in this version include Gen (a wise

Sakura, a young school girl who follows her hero 
Ryu so close, she has the same type of moves. 
Dhalsim and Zangief also return to the fight with 
some news moves. 
 
The other major difference is the loss of 
chain-combos and the gain of a custom combo 
system. Once you reach the required level (which 
is 1 at the least) you can execute a custom combo 
by combining any of the buttons (which there are 6

The original Street Fighter II is a famous 
fighting game. Players select from one of eight 
characters: Ryu, Ken, Blanka, E. Honda, Zangief, 
Chun Li, Guile and Dhalsim to do battle with. They 
must then use their combat strengths to defeat the 
other seven fighters followed by four boss 
characters: M. Bison, Vega, Sagat and Balrog. Each 
character represents a certain country and has 
their own reasons for wanting to win against the 
others. 
 
Each character contains his own selection of basic 
fighting techniques based on three styles of 
punches and three styles of kicks. The effect of 
each of these changes depending on the characters 
orientation (ducking, airborne or standing still). 
Street Fighter 2 made famous the "button 
combination" style of gameplay used to unleash 
powerful moves specific to each character. These 
include the ability to project fireballs, channel 
electricity or capture the opponent in a tight 
suplex. 
 
Street Fighter 2 is one of the most cloned 
fighting games and its effects on gameplay and 
fighting games specifically can not be 
understated. Street Fighter 2 is responsible for 
making popular several different elements.

Before each level, the player chooses one special 
weapon that can be utilized via an often-refilled

choose wisely, you can only use one special weapon 
per round, and once used, it will be unavailable

You are a caveman named Master Higgins. You have a

on the tropic island Waku-Waku. But all of a

bird grasps you and throws down somewhere on the 
island. You have to find your way back and to save 
your girl from the grim reality of 
petrification... 
 
This emotional drama turns out to be a rather 
simple platform game. The short, linear levels are 
all timed, so you have to hurry up and not to get 
delayed by the many treasures you might find on 
your way. You will have a weapon, your old trusty 
boomerang, which you will be able to upgrade 
during the game. After a series on levels, you 
will be invited to a boss battle. The sooner you

Master Higgins finally marries his lovely 
girlfriend Tina. But out of nowhere, a powerful 
tropical cyclone destroyed the idyllic mood of 
their honeymoon. And not only this: it separated 
the ardent lovers again. After the winds stopped 
blowing, Tina found herself somewhere on a 
tropical coast. As for Master Higgins, he went to 
the king of Waku-Waku and, along with his main 
quest to save his brand new wife, got an 
assignment to save also a princess, whom the king 
was about to marry. Is there a connection between 
those two events?.. 
 
No, this is not a detective/mystery game, but 
platform arcade action. What distinguish the game 
clearly not only from ordinary platformers, but 
also from the first Super Adventure Island, are 
its light role-playing and puzzle-solving flavors. 
You don't have a time limit, but huge levels with 
many secret sub-levels to find, puzzles to solve, 
and treasure chests to unlock. You also can have 
equipment, such as swords, shields, etc. By 
defeating enemies, you gain health items, money, 
etc. Your HP is measured by hearts, and it can 
increase during the game if you find appropriate 
items. You also encounter random enemies while 
traveling on a world map.

Alfred the chicken must rescue his friends and his

either climbing to the top of the level or killing

solving positional puzzles. 
 
Alfred cannot fly, but he can use ramps to jump up 
and hit enemies with his bionic beak - this kills 
them, but any other contact will hurt Alfred. 
Watch out for spiked snails though. Other enemies 
include whales armed with guns, and stray bombs.

Conceived partly as an Olympics tie-in, and partly 
as a stop-gap for James Pond fans (the third 
platform title in the series (Operation Starfish) 
was in the process of being heavily delayed, 
eventually being released in 1994), this game saw 
Pond and friends competing in the underwater 
Olympics. 
 
Most events had some sort of twist to them, to 
make them fit the underwater theme, or the style 
of humour seen in the James Pond series. The 
100-metre-splash is similar to joystick-waggling 
games of the 80s but also involves making timed 
jumps to hit seagulls. More unusual is Kipper 
Watching, which involves 'heading' incoming beach 
balls away from a troop of sleeping seals. There's 
also gymnastics, unicycle-riding, and a hurdles 
race of sorts. The events can be played by up to 4 
players.

Super Battleship (c) 1993 Synergistic Software, 
Inc. / Mindscape, Inc. 
 
This game features two different modes of play: 
Classic Battleship and Super Battleship. 
 
Classic Battleship is the typical Battleship game 
where the players set up their ships on a grid, 
then take turns choosing 3 places at a time to 
target and hope they hit the opposing players 
ship. The game ends when all the opposing players 
ships are sunk. This mode contains four difficulty 
levels: Ensign, Lieutenant, Commander, and 
Admiral. 
 
Super Battleship involves eight levels consisting 
of sixteen missions total. Missions include 
sinking enemy ships in a certain number of rounds, 
escorting ships to their destinations, defending 
cities from attack, and destroying enemy 
airfields. Gameplay consists of a turn-based 
moving of ships utilizing an overhead view. The 
player can then target any enemy units within the 
ship's range and attack. Attacking brings up an 
action sequence where both ships trade volleys of 
gunfire until one of them either sinks or 
retreats.

Coalition forces. 
 
Much like its predecessor, the gameplay is a 
first-person tank simulation, using radar to scout 
out enemy tanks and using the main turret gun to 
disable and kill any opposing tanks, jeeps, APCs 
and various other heavy weapons including SCUD 
missiles.  If the player encounters and air 
resistance, they can mount their Phalanx machine 
gun to cut down enemy choppers.

Super Black Bass (c) Apr, 1993 Starfish Inc. / 
HOT-B USA, Inc. 
 
Super Black Bass is a bass fishing game where 
players can compete in four different lake 
tournaments. Player can fish in: Skywater Lake 
(Local Amateur), Clear Lake (Amateur), Murphy Lake 
(Pro) and Bluestone Lake (Super Bass), the goal of 
which is to catch a certain weight limit of bass 
before a certain time limit. 
 
There are two screens, the boating screen where 
players navigate a lake using the D-Pad to 
navigate, the "A" button for acceleration and the 
"B" button for reverse.  The "Y" button is used to 
enter the fishing screen.  There is also a fish 
finder on the lower part of the screen that helps 
the player in locating a good place to fish. 
 
When the player enters the "fishing screen", they 
can use the "L & R" shoulder buttons to increase 
the distance meter, the "X" button brings up the 
lure selection screen, the "B" button can bring an 
overhead view of the location the player currently 
has the lure set for and the "Y" button brings the 
player back to the "boat mode".  To cast, the 
player presses the "A" button once to start the 
cast meter and a pressing it again when the meter 
is set at a certain limit to cast it. 
 
While fishing, the player will have an overhead 
top-down mode of the lake, using the "A" button to 
reel in their lure and using the D-Pad to 
manipulate movement of the lure.  Fish can be seen 
through the water, outlined in a light color while 
bigger fish are seen stationary and cast in a dark 
shadow.  Once the player hooks the fish, a meter 
will show up at the bottom, showing the tension of 
the line, when it hits to the far right of the 
meter, the line will snap.  The line can also be 
manually cut by pressing the "A+B" buttons 
together. 
 
There are eight different lures to choose from 
(Pencil Bait, Torpedo, Jitterbug, Frog, Crankbait, 
Spoon, Furry Sinker & Plastic Worm) along with 
several different color variations to choose from 
and five fish to catch (Blue Gill, Rainbow Trout, 
Catfish, Northern Pike and the game's namesake, 
Bass). 
 
There are also attributes the player can have, 
Technique and Strength, that can be upgraded by 
catching more bass and  progress can be kept 
through a password feature.

bombermans from before.  Again there are new 
levels and a new story but there are also a lot of 
new features. 
 
Super Bomberman 3 adds in 5 player support using a 
multitap and the extra controller slot.  The 
"revenge" or "miso bomber" feature was introduced 
in this game.  That is when a player dies they can 
still throw bombs in from the sidelines in an 
attempt to swap places with a player that is still 
alive.  Many new powerups were added in this game 
including the Kangaroo which in addition to giving 
a player and extra hit allowed them to have some 
extra ablity including jumping, laying rows of 
bombs, and high speed running. 
 
Players are also not limited to the traditional 
Bomberman.  There is a wide selection of different 
characters that the player can choose from.

Super Bomberman: Panic Bomber World is a puzzle 
game based on the popular  Bomberman series, which 
plays much like a cross between Bomberman and Puyo 
Puyo. Groups of blocks will fall from the top of 
the screen. Match three identical blocks and bombs 
will drop from the top of the screen. 
Occasionally, a lit bomb will fall and explode, 
setting off any bombs it hits and causing a chain 
reaction. The game is over when blocks fill the 
screen. 
 
It is essentially a variant of the console release 
of  Bomberman: Panic Bomber, though without the 
time challenge mode and with several additions. 
Most of the stages play the same way as in the 
earlier version, but they now have real-world 
names (such as "Jamaica"), and dialogue between 
Bomberman and his opponents was added. 
 
The game features a single-player story mode and a

way, Bonk can find power-ups that can change his 
form to creatures such as a shooting Bonk crab, a 
dinosaur form called "Big Kronk", find candies 
that change his size from tiny to huge, travel 
through transportation tubes, and find multiple 
bonus levels. 
 
Bonk still uses his head to smash his enemies, 
propeller seeds that allow Bonk to fly, and for

head in his continuing battle against his arch 
nemesis, King Drool!

Super Buster Bros. (c) 1992 Capcom Co., Ltd. / 
Capcom Co., Ltd. 
 
Super Pang is an adventure for one or two players 
that takes the player around the world, aiming to 
rid the planet of a terrible foe: seemingly 
innocuous-looking bubbles. The main portion of the 
game is Tour mode, where the player visits a 
series of different levels representing different 
countries of the world. Each player's character is 
armed with a gun, which shoots a vertical cable. 
If this hits a bubble, it will cause it to split 
in two. Upgrades allow two cables to be shot at 
once, or the ability to stick a cable to the 
ceiling where it will cling for a few seconds, 
bursting any bubble that hits it. 
 
Players must clear each screen of bubbles before 
progressing to the next one. The largest bubbles 
will have 4 degrees of splitting before clearing. 
Many level layouts have ladders, barriers and 
breakable bricks in part of the screen, affecting 
movement of both the player and the bubbles. 
Faster bubbles in the shape of diamonds also 
bounce around the screen going any which way 
rather than bouncing in predictable arcs like the 
other bubbles. 
 
Several power-up tokens are also available, 
offering features such as splitting all bubbles 
down to their minimal size, freezing the bubbles 
for a few seconds, and various different weapons. 
Monsters also enter the screen periodically, which 
hit the bubbles and take them down a size, and can 
often be directed by the cable weapon. 
 
In addition to the main Tour mode, the game also 
features Panic mode, in which a succession of 
bubbles are thrown at at the players. As the 
player progresses, the amount of bubbles required 
to reach the next level also increases, similar to 
scoring on Tetris.

Super Chase H.Q. (c) 1993 Taito Corporation / 
Taito Corporation 
 
Super Chase H.Q. is an enhanced sequel to Chase 
H.Q. As usual, you must drive your way towards a 
criminal's vehicle, which is known to be involved 
in some crime, while avoiding passing cars to gain 
points. Your car also comes equipped with three 
turbos, which can be useful if you are way behind 
the vehicle. 
 
But this time, cars aren't just the only things 
that you have to worry about. You will also 
encounter bikes that shoot or throw firebombs at 
you, as well as cars that go the wrong way. (If 
you crash into one of these, you'll be sent flying 
through the air.) Not to mention other obstacles 
such as barricades. 
 
Furthermore, as well as the criminal's damage 
indicator, you also have your own. When you 
finally catch up with each criminal,  they are 
likely to shoot at you if you get too close to 
their vehicle, but you may encounter criminals who 
have different ways of attacking you. The fourth 
criminal, for example, launches a missile at you 
if you are further behind him. Once you are shot 
at and hit, your indicator decreases for every 
time you are hit, but this rule does not apply 
when you're hit by passing cars. When your 
indicator is empty or when you're out of time, the 
game ends. 
 
When you complete each round, a statistics screen 
will appear, and you are awarded points based on 
the time remaining, how much damage you've done, 
and the number of nitros that are used. One of the 
options allow you to display the game's 
speedometer in either MPH or Km/h. The game also 
has a storyline, which can be viewed in between 
rounds.

there is also a Flag Ship, and the game is lost if 
either one is destroyed.) Scenarios are laid on on 
a hexagonal grid, and each space has its own 
terrain type and can be occupied by one unit. You 
move your units around and attack enemy units in 
adjacent hexagons. There are also cities, 
airports, and shipyards, which you can occupy and 
use for your own purposes (ie. to repair a unit). 
Depending on the skill level or scenario you can 
also construct factories to produce additional 
units.

In this final appearance of Fire Pro series on 
16-bit consoles, the usual roster of over 150 
wrestlers from several wresting promotions 
worldwide including several styles from Shoot or 
Pancrase to American and Lucha are joined by 80 
Create-a-wrestler slots, plus secret wrestlers 
such as legends Gotch or Thesz or the roster of 
Blazing Tornado. While all fighters have fictional 
names, a lot of them are perfectly recognizable by 
their attire, stance and style. The CAW mode 
allows the player to create a wrestler from 
scratch, setting how they look (choosing face, 
size, clothing and setting colours) and fight, 
with several styles and stances available, as well 
as over 500 moves, each more suitable for certain 
styles and skills. To make them fight more 
realistically when controlled by the AI, the CAW 
mode also allows one to set move priorities. 
 
Five game modes are available, including World 
Championship (single and tag), Battle Royale, 
5-man Elimination Mode, League Battle and the One 
Night Dream Match. There are several referees 
available (each with their own quirks) and variant 
rules, from allowing fighting outside the ring 
without count-out (or disallowing it) to the 
disabling of disqualifications from illegal moves.

Super Fire Pro Wrestling - Queen's Special (c) Jun 
30, 1995 Human Entertainment, Inc. / Human 
Entertainment, Inc. 
 
Long before the WWE introduced the Divas wrestling 
matches, in Japan there was a more serious affair, 
where wrestling skill was more important than 
breast implants, and matches were "real" (as far 
as wrestling goes) instead of pillow-fighting or 
bra and panties fights. 
 
In this game in the Fire Pro Series, the cast of 
the All Japan Women's Pro-Wrestling promotion are 
available, all fighting to win the Red belt, the 
highest prize of the federation. It's also 
possible to fight in single matches, tournaments, 
Battle Royal and Elimination matches. The usual 
array of options in CAW is present, being possible 
to create 16 new Wrestlers. 
 
Gameplay, as usual is the series, is dramatically 
different than in most western games. Each 
wrestler has a bunch of moves, ranked from weak to 
strong. While it's possible to connect any of them 
from open situations, while grappling only when 
the opponent is already beaten the most powerful 
moves can be successfully used.

Super Godzilla is a 16-bit Godzilla game where the 
player can take control of Toho's famous big green 
lizard as they rampage through Japan.  The game is 
divided into two main gameplay modes, Movement and 
Battle.  Movement has the player travel through 
the city using the D-pad and a map located on the 
bottom of the screen with the objective being to 
destroy certain objectives such as enemy humans 
and buildings as well as pick up power-ups.  There 
is an animation in the screen above the map that 
shows the results of their movements and attacks. 
 
Battle mode kicks in when the player locates an 
enemy on the map, like Biollante or Mechagodzilla, 
and is taken to a side-scrolling cinematic-style 
battle where the player must use punches, tail 
whips and the famous fire breath to drain the 
energy of the opposing monster.  However, the 
Fighting Spirit system is present which is in a 
sense a morality meter where the player must pick 
the right attacks at the right time in order to 
connect certain attacks.  Choosing the wrong 
attacks or failing to connect with them will cause 
the meter to drop and make Godzilla more 
vulnerable to attack.

Super Mario RPG - Legend of the Seven Stars (c) 
Mar 08, 1996 Square Co., Ltd. / Nintendo of 
America Inc. 
 
Super Mario RPG is a console RPG starring none 
other than Nintendo's popular character Mario. 
This game starts off like almost every other Mario 
game, with Bowser kidnapping Princess Toadstool. 
However, when Mario goes to Bowser's Keep to save 
her, a giant sword made by the evil Smithy crashes 
into the castle and sends Mario, the Princess, and 
Bowser flying to separate parts of the world. 
 
The game plays much like a traditional RPG: Mario 
and the members of his party gain experience 
points by defeating enemies. These experience 
points can increase the team's maximum number of 
hit points and flower points (magic points). The 
battles are also turn-based, but this time there 
are timed attacks and defenses. Timed attacks 
allow you to inflict more harm than normal to an 
enemy. Timed defenses, on the other hand, allow an 
enemy to inflict less harm than normal. You are 
only allowed to have three out of five team 
members on your party at a time. Mario is always 
in your party, regardless. Your team members can 
also purchase more weapons and abilities, along 
with better armor.

level and eat the enemies. 
 
Over 90 levels are on offer, with plenty of 
Bowser's evil koopas and new characters around 
each level. Apart from saving Peach, you can also 
save some of Yoshi's friends, other dinosaurs that 
each have a special attack. Each level also

Young Morris Rolph has been trapped in limbo due 
to a malfunction on Dr Krankenpot's new teleport 
machine (how come characters with German-sounding 
names in computer games and films are always evil 
or stupid? Even Darth Vader sounds German.). Now 
he's been split into his 4 component parts, 
represented by liquid, gas, a hard ball and a 
bouncy ball, and he must get through 24 levels (36 
on the special A1200 version - mirroring the 
game's plot-line of improved technology causing 
more problems for Morris) to retrieve the parts of 
the machine so it can be rebuilt to bring him back 
to life. 
 
The gameplay is vaguely influenced by Lemmings, as 
the levels are populated by lots of points which 
can't be crossed in all forms - walls, fires, 
gaps, thornbushes and suchlike. You get a set 
number of transformations on each level, although 
extra ones can be picked up at times, and there 
are heaters and freezers dotted around which cause 
transformations in some states. All this is done 
against a time limit. Like Lemmings 2, you can 
take on the next level in each of the worlds at 
any time, so you have to be stuck 4 times before 
you can't progress.

(c) 1996 Compile / Compile 
 
Sequel to the original Super Nazo Puyo, SNP2 is a 
Puyo Puyo spin-off which combines arcade puzzle 
elements with RPG gameplay. 
 
You play as the young magician Arle as she sets 
out looking for adventure all over the land, 
chatting with NPCs and exploring the game world 
via a standard top-down RPG interface. Quests 
involve careful exploration and solving Nazo Puyo 
challenges which involve specific scenarios of 
puzzle-based gameplay which the player must solve 
under a specific timeframe. These sequences give 
the player a play area in which color-coded 
"puyos" are pre-arranged in different patterns, 
and the player must position and arrange the ones 
that start to fall in order to fullfil the 
objective at hand (clear only a certain row or 
color of puyos, reach a certain number of combos, 
etc.). Additionally, running into specific 
monsters can trigger standard Puyo Puyo duels, in 
which both players have their own play areas and 
the objective is to clear the screen faster than 
the opponent.

Super Nazo Puyo - Ruruu no Ruu (c) 1995 Compile / 
Banpresto Co., Ltd. 
 
A spin-off of the successful action puzzle series 
Puyo Puyo with a twist. Whereas the main Puyo Puyo 
games are aimed at defeating AI or human 
controlled opponents in puzzle duels (where each 
player has his own play area in which color-coded 
"puyos" fall and must clear them out faster than 
his opponent). Nazo Puyo instead challenges the 
player with different single-player scenarios in 
which a specific objective must be completed (such 
as clearing only the red Puyos, or performing a 
specific sequence of combos, etc.). 
 
The game uses the mold of a top-down RPG in which 
you control the young magician Arle as she 
explores towns and dungeons in her search for 
adventure. Each quest involves finding an NPC who 
will trigger one of the aforementioned scenarios 
and rewards Arle with experience points and unique 
items that increase her stats.

games. 
 
1. Blastris A is a falling block game based on 
   Tetris and plays very similar. Blocks appear on 
   the left side of the screen and move towards 
   the right side of the screen, where they will 
   fit into play. The goal is to have the blocks 
   on any column line up and destroy themselves. 
   Each level requires five of these to happen. 
   Unlike Tetris, the player cannot move or even 
   rotate blocks. Instead each section of the 
   block can be destroyed by shooting it. Higher 
   difficulty levels increase the speed of 
   gameplay 
2. Blastris B is a falling block game based on 
   Columns and Puyo Puyo. On each screen are a 
   number of "jelly blocks" which must be 
   destroyed to complete the stage. New blocks 
   appear at the top of the screen and move 
   towards the bottom where they fit into play. 
   Blocks can be destroyed by lining up a row of 4 
   blocks of the same colour. The player is unable 
   to move the falling blocks but may cycle their 
   colour by shooting at them. 
3. Mole Patrol is combination of Whack-a-Mole 
   and a shooting gallery. A number of moles 
   appear on the screen with a flag indicating the 
   amount that need to be destroyed that level, 
   before jumping into a pipe. From there the 
   moles will climb out of any one of 12 holes on 
   the screen and the player must shoot them as 
   fast as possible. Along with regular moles are 
   pink moles that will temporarily speed up 
   gameplay, making shots more difficult. 
 
LazerBlazer Mode feature a group of games set in a 
military atmosphere. 
 
1. Type A: Intercept is a first person shooting 
   game where the player shoots down incoming 
   missiles and airplanes. These missiles/planes 
   appear on the right side of the screen and move 
   towards the left side. A radar is also given to 
   the player to keep track of overall positions 
   of these objects on the screen. Ammunition is 
   limited and the player must shoot down a 
   certain amount each level. 
4. Type B: Engage is a first person shooting 
   game where the player shoots down incoming 
   missiles and airplanes, which will cautiously 
   open fire on the player. These missiles/planes 
   appear in front of the player, in the distance 
   and move towards the player. The player has 
   limited energy which is decreased when hit by 
   an enemy. A radar is also given to the player 
   to keep track of overall positions of these 
   objects on the screen. Ammunition is limited 
   and the player must shoot down a certain amount 
   each level. 
5. Type C: Confront is a first person shooting 
   game where the player shoots down incoming 
   spacecraft, which will actively open fire on 
   the player. These UFOs can appear anywhere on 
   the screen and the player must shoot them down 
   before they open fire on the player. Each hit 
   by an enemy decreases the player's shield 
   energy. A radar is also given to the player to 
   keep track of overall positions of these 
   objects on the screen. Ammunition is limited 
   and the player must shoot down a certain amount 
   each level.

Super Ninja Boy (c) 1992 Culture Brain Inc. / 
Culture Brain USA, Inc. 
 
One day a spaceship came down from the heavens and 
into the skies of Chinaland. It began broadcasting 
an image of peace. Soon Emperor Chin was holding a 
peace conference with the space ship's leader, 
Rub-A-Doc. Rub-A-Doc visited with some of the 
other places in the world before departing to the 
heavens and leaving the world. All seemed peaceful 
however there seems to be trouble starting up, 
strange monsters have been seen throughout 
Chinaland. Could the increase in monsters be 
somehow related to the recent visit from 
Rub-A-Doc? The ninja masters of Mount Edin, Jack 
and Ryu are sent to investigate... 
 
Super Ninja Boy is an action RPG for one or two 
players. In a two player game, each player 
controls either Jack or Ryu. In a one player game, 
only Jack appears.A second player may join at any 
time by visiting a convenience store. 
 
As mentioned, this game is an RPG and contains 
familiar RPG elements such as equipping differing 
kinds of weapons, equipment and gaining levels. 
The Ninja Boys are treated as a single entity and 
so these statistics are shared between Jack and 
Ryu with equal values. Battles with the enemy, 
either through random encounters or visible on the 
map is where the action starts. The characters 
enter a side-scrolling 'battle mode' where they 
may jump, fight, use their special techniques, 
items and spells... as well as activate various 
'bonuses' on the battlefield by breaking open the 
bonus boxes. A battle is over and experience 
points awarded when a pre-determined number of 
enemies are defeated or the Ninja Boys are 
defeated. 
 
When bosses are encountered, the gameplay changes 
to a turn-based system. Each turn, commands are 
given to Jack & Ryu, which include usage of 
special items and skills accuired during the game, 
who then perform actions based on those commands. 
The enemy's turn takes place the same way. The 
battle ends when one side of the conflict runs out 
of hitpoints.

Successful races bring more money, which can be 
used to soup up their machine. Boosts to top 
speed, grip and acceleration can be purchased, and 
your nitro boost must be kept topped up. If you 
are desperate for upgrades, you can buy into your 
spare credits 
 
Only your off-road driving abilities will be

Super Off Road - The Baja (c) Sep, 1993 Leland 
Interactive Media / Tradewest, Inc. 
 
Super Off Road: The Baja is a sequel of Super Off 
Road. Unlike its predecessor which uses an 
isometric top-down view of a single-screen track, 
this arcade racing game is made specifically for 
the SNES and uses its Mode 7 hardware for a 3D 
racing experience with a 3rd person perspective. 
 
The game has three different tournaments, the 
Mexico 250, Ensenada 500 and Baja 1000. Instead of 
having to drive many consecutive rounds on a small 
circuit the circuits are big and more akin to 
rally racing with a finish at a different location 
than the start. The game is still held with many 
opponents as well as non participating traffic and 
wildlife that can hinder the player or be 
ruthlessly run over. Along the bumpy off-road 
tracks the player can collect bags of money, just 
like in its predecessor. Money can be spend on 
improvements of various of the car's parts, such 
as: brakes, tires, shocks, lights, engine and 
nitros.

moves available - he can stretch himself to 
traverse larger gaps between (or move up/down)

doesn't feature an MLB license, instead the teams 
nicknames are omitted and team colors are altered. 
 
There are six modes to choose from: Exhibition, 
Home Run Derby, Defense Practice, Playoffs, 
League, that has the player compete against each 
team in the game in succession and Game Breaker 
which lets the player choose from 17 scenarios to 
win the game under certain conditions.  They can 
also choose different Division Champion line-ups 
that range from 1989-1993 or All-Star Lineups from 
1989-1994. 
 
The graphics of the game are presented in a 
cartoonish-way and the stadiums are "authentic", 
but altered to distinguish themselves from the 
actual MLB stadiums.  The game doesn't feature a 
battery back-up like many other baseball games, 
but Series championships can be saved using 
passwords.  Jack Buck also lends his voice talent 
to the game calling play-by-play commentary.

Super Smash T.V. (c) 1991 Williams Entertainment

The year is 1999. The world's most popular 
television show is Smash T.V., an ultra-violent 
contest between two armed-to-the-teeth combatants, 
set loose in a series of deadly arenas that are 
filled to bursting with hordes of mindless beasts 
and killer robots. The aim of the game is to blast 
everything in sight and try to grab more cash and 
prizes than the other guy. Toaster ovens, VCRs, 
fancy cars and luxury holidays are there for the 
taking... for anyone who can survive long enough 
to enjoy them. 
 
Smash T.V. is an insane shoot-em-up from the brain 
of Eugene Jarvis, creator of Robotron: 2084. It 
retains that game's frantic style of play and 
two-joystick control method, but adds plenty of 
gore, violence, a hint of satire and that 
all-important two player mode.

Super Star Wars (c) Jun 01, 1992 Sculptured 
Software, Inc.|LucasArts Entertainment Company LLC 
/ JVC Musical Industries, Inc. 
 
The story of this game is based on Episode IV: A 
New Hope, the first of the original  Star Wars 
movie trilogy. The player initially controls the 
movie's main hero, Luke Skywalker, but two more 
controllable characters join later: the careless 
captain Han Solo and his Wookie side-kick, 
Chewbacca. The game generally follows the movie 
plot, allowing the player to experience some of 
the most important sequences, such as the search 
for Obi-Wan Kenobi, rescuing princess Leia, and 
the final confrontation against Death Star and its 
TIE Fighters, led by the mysterious Darth Vader. 
 
Most of the game levels follow traditional 
platform gameplay style. As Luke, Han, or 
Chewbacca, the player makes his way through the 
linear levels, fighting enemies, jumping over 
obstacles, and collecting power-ups. The power-ups 
include standard health-restoring items, upgrades 
for the blaster gun (up to five different upgrade 
levels), as well as special items that can be used 
for massive destruction of the enemies. Luke uses 
a weak blaster gun, but later gains access to a 
lightsaber, being able to fight enemies 
melee-style. Han and Chewbacca use stronger flame 
guns, but cannot upgrade to better weapons. 
 
Some of the levels are dedicated to familiar Star 
Wars vehicles (such as a land speeder). 
Controlling the vehicle from a third-person view, 
the player has to navigate it through the 
pseudo-3D environments, avoiding obstacles and 
shooting at enemies on the way.

spiced up with some slightly different 
(gameplay-wise) sequences. Race to Jabba the 
Hutt's palace in a speeder, fight your way through

Super Star Wars - The Empire Strikes Back (c) Jun 
01, 1993 Sculptured Software, Inc.|LucasArts 
Entertainment Company LLC / JVC Musical 
Industries, Inc. 
 
The sequel to  Super Star Wars is, as the name 
implies, based on Episode V: The Empire Strikes 
Back, the second of the original  Star Wars movie 
trilogy. The game features familiar locations and 
events from the film, such as the ice planet Hoth, 
the search for Yoda on the jungle planet Dagobah, 
and the fight against Darth Vader. Several 
locations are expanded, adding places and boss 
enemies that did not exist in the movie, and 
certain key events in the story are omitted or 
changed. 
 
As in the previous game, the player is able to 
control three characters: Luke Skywalker, Han 
Solo, and Chewbacca. Unlike the first, each 
character has been given a distinct special move. 
Chewie spins a path of destruction through 
enemies, Han has grenades and a powerful slide, 
and Luke can switch to his lightsaber and block 
oncoming fire. Gameplay is very similar to the 
first game, mostly focusing on platforming 
elements. As before, there are Mode-7 vehicle 
levels, during which the player is able to pilot a 
snowspeeder against encroaching Imperial walkers, 
pilot the Millennium Falcon through the asteroid 
field, and break through Cloud City's defenses in 
Luke's X-Wing fighter. 
 
The game's other major addition is the inclusion 
of a suite of Force powers for Luke. They are 
learned by collecting hidden orbs on the Dagobah 
level, and add a second special bar that depletes 
with each usage of a Force power. Power-ups 
include health items, weapon upgrades, 
screen-clearing detonators, and orbs that restore 
Luke's Force power. Passwords have also been 
added, and are given upon completion of each of 
the game's 25 stages.

Super Tetris 2 + Bombliss (c) Dec 18, 1992 Tose 
Co., Ltd. / Bullet-Proof Software, Inc. 
 
Super Tetris 2 + Bombliss is one of the many 
versions of the famous soviet puzzle game, the 
first one available for the Super Nintendo, and an 
updated version of Tetris 2 + Bombliss. 
 
As the title would suggest, the game features both 
standard Tetris as well as another similar game 
called Bombliss. Tetris offers three game modes: 
standard marathon (A-type), start with garbage 
(B-type), and rising garbage (C-type). There is 
also a two-player versus mode where clearing rows 
sends garbage to the other player. 
 
Bombliss is slightly different from normal Tetris. 
Arranged on the board and in some dropped pieces 
are bomb squares. Completing a row does not clear 
the blocks in the row, but will trigger any bombs 
in the row which will destroy blocks. Different 
sizes of bombs will generate larger explosions. 
Bombliss is offered in standard marathon mode, a 
puzzle mode where a set board must be cleared 
using set piece drops, and a 2-player versus mode.

Super Tetris 3 (c) Dec 16, 1994 Tose Co., Ltd. / 
Bullet-Proof Software, Inc. 
 
Super Tetris 3 is yet another version of the 
famous soviet puzzle game. However, despite what 
the title may suggest, contained within are 
actually four different versions of Tetris: Tetris 
Classic, Familiss, Sparkliss, and Magicaliss. 
Tetris Classic, of course, is the basic version of 
the game, which comes with an endless mode and a 
25-line "standard" mode. Familiss, as the name 
might suggest, is a family mode for up to four 
players simultaneously. Sparkliss, meanwhile, is 
very similar to Bombliss from Super Tetris 2, only 
with a medieval fantasy theme and different 
explosion patterns. Sparkliss includes both a 
stage mode and a puzzle mode. 
 
The most unique mode is Magicaliss, which has 
never shown up on any other version of Tetris. In 
Magicaliss, pieces come in three basic colors, and 
by rotating the piece, the player can choose 
between them. Creating a line entirely out of one 
color will clear all blocks on the screen of that 
color. There are also grey pieces, which can only 
be cleared by creating a line made entirely from 
one color, which will cause all grey blocks on 
screen to become that color. There are also rare 
rainbow pieces which will act as any color. 
Besides these additions, the game itself is basic 
Tetris. 
 
Tetris Classic, Sparkliss, and Magicaliss can also 
be played in a two-player battle mode, besides the 
four-player Familiss mode.

Super Turrican is the next generation installment 
of the famous Turrican Series. Once again it is up 
to the U.S.S. Freedom Forces to get into their 
Turrican Assault Suits and drive back the forces 
of "The Machine". 
 
Similar to it's predecessors, Super Turican 
features large levels that are crammed with 
secrets and can be explored freely and in any 
direction. To get rid of the numerous enemies, 
Turrican can use three upgradeable shots: A 
spreadshot, a powerful laser and a rebound that 
bounces off of walls. Additionally, there is a 
Freeze-Beam that can be used to temporarily freeze 
enemies. It is fully rotatable, and therefor also 
a great help in discovering secret capsules. These 
capsules contain powerups and can often be used to 
reach secret areas. Last but not least, Turrican 
has the ability to transform into an energy wheel 
(as long as he has enough special energy), which 
enables him to lay mines and even makes him 
invincible.

Super Turrican 2 (c) 1994 Factor 5 GmbH / Ocean

Super Turrican is back, and once again the USS 
Freedom Forces have to prevent the evil Machine 
from harming innocent civilizations. 
This requires the player to jump and shoot his way 
through large levels filled with lots of enemies. 
To get rid of all the enemies, several different 
weapons can be used, most of which are already 
familiar to players from previous installments of 
the series: a Laser, a Spread-shot, and 
a(improved) Rebound. There is also the option to 
go 
into "wheel-mode" for a limited time to become 
invincible, lay mines and shoot rockets. The 
Flamethrower is new to the series as well as the 
Rope, which can be used to climb walls, cling to 
platforms or pick up out-of-reach items. Much like 
in side-scrolling shooters, you can now pick up 
homing missiles as secondary weapons. The biggest 
difference to previous Turrican-games however, is 
the fact that in Super Turrican 2 almost half of 
the levels are strictly linear and don't feature 
any large secret areas that have become somewhat 
of a trademark of the series.

Once upon a time, there was a prince named 
Gallagher. He was entrusted with a magical ring 
that granted him great powers. But he was too weak 
to control the power of the ring, and became 
possessed by it. The mad prince was sealed into a 
crystal, but many years later managed to break 
out, planning to wreak havoc on the Dream World 
and to conquer it! Yuko, the heroine of the three 
previous Valis games, is no longer a sacred Valis 
warrior - she has become a goddess. Lena, a young 
girl who wants to become a Valis warrior, is the 
new main character, who must prove to Yuko she is 
worthy to wield the sword of Valis, that will 
eventually stop the evil plans of Gallagher. 
 
Like the previous games in the series, this is an 
action platform game. You can fight enemies with 
melee weapons or use magic. In order to cast magic 
spells, you must gather special items while 
fighting off regular enemies. At the end of a 
level, a boss enemy battle awaits you. The game 
features cut scenes with animé-style graphics to 
advance the story.

Planet Earth is in danger from assorted villains 
who want to destroy the environment for their own 
nefarious purposes!  Far off in the Horsehead 
Nebula, a group of shapeshifting aliens known as 
World Watchers assign planets for their Watchers 
to protect.  A purple alien, Widget, is an 
apprentice assigned with the job of protecting 
Earth.  Along for the ride is his intelligent 
sidekick, Mega Brain. 
 
Super Widget is a platform game for the Super 
Nintendo, based on the cartoon show, Widget.  It 
shares some similarities to the game Felix the Cat 
in how the main character upgrades their weapon as 
they collect more power-ups. 
 
Widget navigates through various worlds as he 
travels to Earth, picking up 'W' coins - 100 earns 
him an extra life.  There are also special power 
ups in different categories - these allow Widget 
to transform into a variety of different 
creatures, each with their own different ranged 
attack.  As the player collects more power-ups of 
the same type (up to three), they change into more 
powerful creatures.  If the player gets hit while 
transformed, they change back to the previous 
creature.  If they get hit while as normal Widget, 
they lose a life. 
 
At the end of each world is a boss character.  
These are larger enemies that require learning 
their basic pattern, avoiding their attacks, and 
then firing back with your own.  After defeating 
the boss, the player is graded based on how long 
it took to complete the level and their combat 
skills.  They are then awarded 'Watcher 
Experience' based on these grades.

are the Marketing director (hit man) for one of 
these companies.  It is your job to take control 
away from the competitors.  The job is not one of

control.  Advance your way to the top of the 
corporation by successfully completing your 
missions and managing the money you make from your 
territories. 
 
The gameplay is visually reminiscent of X-Com, 
with an angled top-down perspective, but it is 
real time rather than turn based. You have 
missions ranging from infiltrate and capture, to 
seek and destroy. In each of these you direct a 
team of four agents as they move through the world 
shooting at anything that gets in their way. 
 
You can upgrade and modify your agents, as well as 
equip them with tools you have researched or 
liberated from opposing syndicates.  As you 
complete missions, you gain more funds to use for 
purchasing agents or researching upgrades and 
equipment.

T2 - The Arcade Game (c) 1993 Midway / LJN,

As the title states, this is the home conversion 
of the arcade rail-shooter based on the film 
Terminator 2: Judgement Day. Up to two players 
shoot through future and present levels as robotic 
killers reprogrammed to serve the human 
resistance. 
 
Both players wield a machine gun with infinite 
ammo that lowers its firing rate (overheats) as it 
is continuously fired. A secondary weapon (missile 
launchers in the future, shotguns in the present) 
has limited ammo but deals heavy damage. Powerups 
inside the game world include secondary weapon 
ammo and coolant for the machine guns, and are 
shot to be collected. 
 
T2: The Arcade Game features seven levels based on 
specific scenes or general concepts in the film. 
The first four levels act as a prelude, as the 
player guns down waves of metal Terminators across 
a post-apocalyptic Battlefield, a besieged Human 
Hideout, and through the security checkpoints of 
the enemy supercomputer SkyNet. After destroying 
the computer, players travel back in time to 
protect John and Sarah Connor, while also 
destroying every scrap of SkyNet research at the 
headquarters of its manufacturer. From there, 
players must fend off the indestructible T-1000 
until the final showdown in the Steel Mill. 
 
Assets from the movie are used when possible, such 
as voice clips from Arnold Schwarzenegger, and 
close-up digital stills of Robert Patrick for the 
final battle against the T-1000. The Genesis and 
SNES versions also support lightguns (the Menacer 
and Super Scope, respectively).

Tales of Phantasia (c) Dec 15, 1995 Wolf Team / 
Namco Limited 
 
In "Tales of Phantasia", you play a young boy 
named Cless, who lives together with his parents 
in a quiet village. It was a day like all the 
others when Cless decided to go hunting with his 
best friend Chester. Chasing a wild boar, Cless 
discovered a strange talking tree in the forest 
who was pleading him for help. But as soon as it 
stopped speaking, the two friends heard the sound 
of an alarm. They returned to the village and 
found it burnt down, and all its inhabitants 
murdered. Before Cless' mother died in his arms, 
she told him this terrible massacre had something 
to do with the pendant she and her husband gave 
Cless for his birthday... what connection could 
there be? Cless decides to visit his uncle who 
lives in another town, but he doesn't realize his 
journey will take him to much more remote places 
than that! 
 
"Tales of Phantasia" presents a unique combat 
system: The battles have a lot in common with 
fighting games: you fight on a platform that 
slowly scrolls forward and have to attack your 
enemy in real time. Other party members are 
controlled by AI. You can pause the game at any 
time and use magic, items, or choose an overall 
strategy for your allies.

Taz-Mania (c) 1992 Visual Concepts, Ltd. / Sun 
   Corporation of America 
 
This version of Taz-Mania is different from the 
side-scrolling versions by Sega, in this version 
the player controls Taz from a third-person 
perspective.  The goal of the game is to travel 
down the road, collecting Kiwi's before the timer 
runs out, avoiding obstacles along the way.  The 
Kiwi's will get harder to catch as the game goes 
on, jumping over Taz and actually outrunning him 
at times. 
 
Some obstacles Taz faces are trees, telephone 
poles, tour buses, even pterodactyls who will 
bring Taz back at the beginning of the level, but 
also have to avoid characters such as Axl & Bull, 
a pair of gators who try to capture Taz for the 
zoo, The She-Devil who is in love with Taz and if 
the player is caught by her, the game is instantly 
over and Wendal T. Wolf, who will jump on Taz's 
back and cover the screen with his hands making it 
hard to see. 
 
You can avoid some obstacles by using Taz's 
tornado spin, but using the spin will cause Taz's 
health meter to drop, but it can be refilled by 
eating Kiwi's along with blue and red birds, 
bushrats and items thrown to Taz by Didgeri Dingo, 
but beware, he can also throw obstacles at Taz as 
well including T.N.T.  There is also a bonus 
stages after completing three levels in which you 
collect as many items you can in the allotted time 
to raise the score.

The game is very much in the tradition of the

(besides the turtles) will be familiar, such as 
the Rat King, or even Shredder (now called

Though even people familiar with the turtles will 
see differences in them. They can now, for 
example, do moves involving projectiles, such as 
"fireballs". 
 
The game's modes include a story mode, where you 
can only pick one of the turtles and go on 
fighting opponents in order to rescue April and 
Splinter, and a tournament mode, where you fight 
only for the fame and money.

Tenchi Muyou! Game Hen (c) Oct 27, 1995 TamTam 
Co., Ltd. / Banpresto Co., Ltd. 
 
Sasami is kidnapped by a mysterious little girl 
with magical powers, and Tenchi and his companions 
must travel to rescue her, battling monsters and 
other creatures on the way. 
 
Tenchi Muyou! Game-Hen is a strategy game with RPG 
elements, based on the popular Japanese Tenchi 
Muyo! cartoon series. The game moves from battle 
to battle, with the plot being revealed through 
cutscenes between them. The player fights the 
computer on turns, controlling the individuals 
from a party of four. The party members are 
selected on a separate screen before each battle, 
and as the game progresses new characters become 
available. 
 
During the skirmish, selecting the characters 
brings up a menu with three command options: move, 
attack or end turn. A fourth transform option 
becomes available later, after they reach a higher 
level. When moving or attacking, glowing tiles on 
the ground show the maximum range of the action. 
Performing either one costs action points, shown 
as eight regenerating green dots on the status 
window, alongside basic statistics like health, 
defense and attack levels. Characters level up 
automatically while on the battlefield, increasing 
their abilities and receiving more powerful 
attacks. Health powers are also accessed through 
the attack menu, recovering lost points to an 
ailing comrade within their range. Characters can 
transform to a more powerful version when they 
have the ability to do so, and all the eight green 
dots are still available. The transformed unit has 
more powerful attacks and a wider range of 
movement. 
 
After the battle, a map screen appears where the 
player can save the game, and choose the next 
battle from one of the available paths. It is 
possible to revisit battlegrounds, to level up 
before tackling stronger enemies.

Tengai Makyou Zero (c) Dec 21, 1995 Red Company 
Corporation / Hudson Soft Company, Ltd. 
 
Tengai Makyo Zero is a side-story to the first 
three  Tengai Makyo games (for PC Engine CD). The 
ancient land of Jipang is a lot like the medieval 
Japan, but is is ruled by godly and demonic 
powers, and is made up of six countries, the most 
powerful one being the Ryu (Dragon) Kingdom. The 
younger of two brothers has been recently chosen 
to be the king of the Dragon Country. The elder 
brother decides to kill him and to take the 
throne. His soul is possessed by the demon Ninigi, 
and he plots a further destruction of Jipang. 
 
The hero of the game, a young boy named Higan, 
lives in Hikagi Village. After the village has 
been frozen by the possessed king of Ryu, Higan 
realizes he was chosen by a mysterious Ancient 
Flame to free Jipang from the claws of Ninigi. 
 
The game is a traditional RPG with turn-based 
combat viewed from over-the-shoulder perspective. 
The characters can attack physically, cast magic 
spells, as well as perform special techniques, 
unique to each character.

In "Terranigma", you play a young boy named Ark. 
He has grown up in his little village, isolated 
from the outer world by a stream of lava, and has 
never seen anything else beside it. One day, he 
and some other boys hear mysterious voices coming 
from beyond a door the village elder forbade them 
to open. Unable to resist their curiosity, the 
boys open the door, and Ark finds a box with a 
strange creature inside. By opening the box, Ark 
damages the balance between two co-existing 
worlds, and all the village people are turned into 
stones. Now Ark has to embark on a dangerous 
journey - to find five Towers, and to seek there 
the answers to his questions, and to liberate his 
people from a terrible curse. 
 
"Terranigma" is an action game with slight RPG 
elements. Ark levels up after having completed an 
important quest or cleared out an area. He can 
attack enemies with various weapons, using various 
techniques: pierce, leap, dash, etc. 
 
The game is closely connected to and often 
regarded as a part of a trilogy created by Enix, 
the first two games being Soul Blazer and Illusion 
of Gaia.

Each play field starts with different colored dots

each color flashing. The blocks are made up of the 
same three colors, and by matching blocks of the 
same color over the top or to the side of the dot 
will clear the dot and those blocks from the 
screen. If you clear a flashing dot, all the 
corresponding dots of the same color will be 
cleared. To complete the round just clear the 
dots, not the blocks themselves.

Tetris Attack (c) Sep, 1996 Intelligent Systems 
Co., Ltd. / Nintendo of America Inc. 
 
All is not well on Yoshi's Island! The devious 
king Bowser has cast a spell on the island's 
inhabitants, turning them into his mindless 
slaves. Only Yoshi has escaped its effects, and so 
he must set off to free his friends, and to defeat 
Bowser and break the spell. 
 
Tetris Attack is a fact-paced action puzzler 
featuring the colorful cast of characters from 
Yoshi's Island. A stack of blocks continually 
rises from the bottom of the screen, and the 
player controls a cursor which can swap any two 
blocks horizontally. Make a row or column of three 
or more and they'll clear, potentially creating 
combos from new blocks falling to take their 
place. Combos will send large garbage blocks to 
your opponent, which must be eliminated by 
clearing a piece that is touching it, turning it 
into normal blocks. 
 
The game offers a story mode against the computer, 
as well as a 2-player versus mode, an endless 
mode, a timed mode where a certain number of 
blocks must be cleared, and a puzzle mode where a 
set arrangement of blocks must be cleared in a 
specific number of moves. The game is based on the 
Japan-only title Panel de Pon.

Tetris & Dr. Mario (c) Dec 30, 1994 Nintendo Co., 
Ltd. / Nintendo of America Inc. 
 
Two of the most popular puzzle games return, but 
now together in an exclusive compilation for SNES. 
The games have a slight graphical update when 
compared with the original Game Boy and NES games, 
but the gameplay remains totally faithful to the 
games released for both platforms. 
 
In Tetris, the main objective is to pile blocks 
that will fall down continuously, in order to 
create a row or "line" without spaces. For this 
collection, the game comes with two bonus options: 
2 PLAYER GAME (absent in the NES version) and VS. 
COM (absent in both versions), with 3 CPU 
opponents available, each one representing a 
difficulty level (EASY, MEDIUM, and HARD, 
respectively). 
 
In Dr. Mario, the objective is to eliminate all 
the viruses contained in a big bottle. Dr. Mario 
(situated in the upper-right side of the screen) 
will throw capsules with 6 different color 
combinations (Red-Red, Red-Blue, Yellow-Yellow, 
Red-Yellow, Blue-Blue and Blue-Yellow) in order to 
line up at least four viruses or capsules of the 
same color horizontally or vertically and to make 
them disappear. In this compilation, the game 
comes with a bonus option: VS. COM, where you'll 
face the CPU players: Blue Virus (EASY), Yellow 
Virus (MEDIUM), and Red Virus (HARD). 
 
For competitive players in both games, there is 
Mixed Match, where you and a friend can play 
Tetris and Dr. Mario like a tournament! Adjust the 
handicap levels, play time, music, and other 
settings to balance your different skills. The 
game order is: TETRIS B-TYPE (clear a certain 
amount of lines), DR. MARIO (disinfect a 
predetermined number of viruses) and TETRIS A-TYPE 
(clear lines until the time expires). At the end 
of the time limit, the player with the highest 
score is the winner.

Theme Park (c) 1995 Bullfrog Productions, Ltd. / 
Ocean Software Ltd. 
 
Dominating the exciting world of Theme Park 
ownership is your goal in this strategy game from 
Bullfrog. The first task is to set up your rides 
within the available land, structuring convenient 
paths and queues and ideally leaving some space 
for bigger rides once they become available, and 
include some lakes and trees to increase the 
park's allure. Rides range from Teacups and 
Haunted Houses to the biggest most elaborate 
roller-coaster you can design, and water rides 
that loop around other rides. 
 
Shops must also be included, so that the visitors 
can buy food, drinks and souvenirs - the cunning 
player will combine salt, sugar and caffeine 
settings to maximize consumer interest. Staff must 
be hired to keep everything running smoothly, and 
they will only work for what they consider a fair 
rate of pay. 
 
You are competing against other Theme Parks, so 
don't let them get an advantage over you - monitor 
your success in attracting customers and financial 
viability closely using the supplied statistics 
pages. More important, ensure that research is 
adequately funded to produce new rides. 
 
It can be played in three modes - Sandbox level 
lets you concentrate on the park design elements, 
while Sim and Full add more strategic features.

outer space locations. 
 
The game gives you a health-bar and the ability to

Get ready to put your blue skin-tight tights on. 
Ninjas need beating-up, bosses need clobbering! 
This game is not so much a platform game as it is 
a fighting game (think Streets of Rage). You run 
around the levels avoiding sharp flying objects 
and fighting any enemies that get in your way, 
including the numerous bosses. If your in a tight 
spot you can 
call Arthur to help defeat any enemies that are 
on-screen. The game is presented in a normal 2D 
platformer view when you're just jumping from 
building to building, but changes to a 
semi-isometric view when you start fighting. 
You'll probably like it if you like Streets of 
Rage.

Timecop (c) 1995 Cryo Interactive Entertainment / 
Victor Interactive Software, Inc. 
 
Based off of the Jean Claude Van Damme film 
Timecop, this game acts as a sequel of sorts. We 
learned well from the film that the power time 
travel affords corrupts all men weaker than the 
Muscles from Brussels, and this has extended to 
the original inventor of time travel. He proclaims 
himself dictator of the universe, captures Van 
Damme as he arrives from fixing all the wrongs in 
the film, and challenges him to a "duel across 
time." Platforming action follows across multiple 
periods of history. 
 
The primary feature of this game is its digitized 
characters, uncommon for console games of that 
era. Actors were taped in front of a bluescreen 
and stills were taken from the video to create all 
characters and their animations. The effect is 
impressive for the SNES, though it does result in 
robotic enemies who do not respond well to being 
punched or kicked. The "timing,", both in terms of 
controlling your character and fighting with enemy 
characters seems off through the entire game. 
 
There are 15 levels in total, most of which are 
standard fighting platform levels. Three basic 
fighting moves are available to the character, not 
including jumping and crouching kicks, and not 
including the use of a gun with extremely limited 
ammo. Some vehicle levels are mixed in, and the 
game culminates in a jetpack duel over Los Angeles 
with the villainous time travel creator fellow. 
 
The game also featured some rare use of digital 
voice, primarily in the "FBI... Get on it!" 
background theme in the first few levels.

On the reptilian planet of Tirmat, scientists have 
discovered a rift in space and plan to use it to 
transport the planet's inhabitants before the 
planet is extinguished by sending their elite army 
through the rift and invade their closest 
neighbor...Earth.  However, to ensure their 
success they send their army into Earth's past in 
hopes of avoiding any modern weapons and increase 
their chances of saving their planet.  However, 
Earth has learned of their evil plot and has 
developed a experimental time portal and has sent 
their own one man army to stop them. 
 
The player takes control of Dr. Vincent Gilgamesh 
who has acquired a massive arsenal including 
pistols, machine guns, rocket launchers and many 
more heavy weapons and must travel through various 
time periods including Medieval times, prehistoric 
times, Ancient Rome and Egypt and even the distant 
future.  The gameplay is similar to Contra where 
the player advances through the stages, shooting 
at various enemies and collecting power-ups and 
must also avoid various traps and pitfalls 
scattered throughout the levels.  There are also 
the standard bosses at the end of each stage.

Tin Star is a robot Sheriff in the Ol' West. He 
has vowed to rid the town of the Bad Oil gang and 
their leader, Black Bart, within a week. Along 
with his sidekick Mo Crash and even more 
importantly his six-gun he will try to accomplish 
this task. 
 
The game takes place over a week with each day 
being a different stage. Stages are broken down 
into 4 parts. The first part is a training section 
where players can practice shooting. The next two 
parts are action scenes. In the action scenes, 
gameplay consists of moving a cross-hair over 
various enemies and shooting them. The final part 
ends the day with a showdown. The showdown 
involves a one on one duel in which a draw icon 
will randomly pop up anywhere on the screen which 
must be shot then immediately afterwards the enemy 
the player is facing then must also be shot. This 
continues on until either the player's or the 
enemy's life bar is drained. 
 
If a player doesn't shoot an energy canteen during 
a level a bonus screen will appear. The bonus 
screen shows a woman spinning around on a round 
board with stars next to her body. Shooting the 
stars without missing and without accidentally 
shooting the woman will help players pick up large 
amounts of money. 
 
At the end of a level the amount of money made is 
tallied up. For every bullet wasted and damage 
taken the player loses money. The player gains 
money equal to the their accuracy and the amount 
of energy they had left at the end of the stage.

Top Gear 2 (c) Sep, 1993 Gremlin Interactive Ltd. 
/ KEMCO U.S.A., INC. 
 
This third-person racing game resembles Gremlin's 
earlier Lotus series, in terms of its general look 
and feel, right down to the text font used in the 
game. Your task is to race through 16 countries, 
each of which features four races, with many 
real-world circuits recreated in incongruous 
locations (such as the Monza layout in Ayers Rock, 
and the old Hockenheim in Vancouver). 
 
These four-race blocks each represent their own 
mini-championship, in which you race against 19 
cars, needing to finish in the top 10 to continue, 
and with the top 6 scoring points 10-6-4-3-2-1, 
and the respective amount of money in thousands. 
This can be spent on various upgrades, ranging 
from engine to tires (wet and dry) and from shocks 
(front, side and rear) to gearboxes. The ideal 
approach is to buy the more expensive versions 
ASAP, as you get no saving when upgrading. If you 
win the four-race championship, you get the next 
password. 
 
You get a set amount of nitro boost to use during 
each race, although bonus nitros, money and 
instant speed-up token appear on many tracks. 
Hazards such as puddles, barriers and ramps are 
also frequent.

Torneko (aka Taloon) from Dragon Quest IV was a 
merchant and treasure hunter who always dreamed of 
owning his own shop. Having defeating the evil 
along with other heroes, he returned to Endor to 
work peacefully. Some time has passed and after 
growing successful in this town, Torneko grew 
anxious. Hearing rumors one day about a 
"Mysterious Dungeon", Torneko meets with the king 
to ask permission to set up a new shop, closer to 
this Mysterious Dungeon. By exploring this cavern 
and returning safely with the prizes, Torneko 
hopes to become the most successful merchant in 
the world. 
 
Torneko No Daibouken is a overhead view game 
similar to Hack, what might be called a "dungeon 
crawl". Torneko must venture into the mysterious 
dungeon gathering treasure. He may equip any 
weapons and shields he finds there, as well as 
gather up items such as spell scrolls, staffs and 
herbs with a variety of effect. A variety of 
enemies, familiar to the Dragon Quest series, 
await him. If Torneko successfully exits the 
dungeon, he is able to sell any of the items he 
has collected. This money then goes to improve the 
quality of his shop and living quarters. As the 
game progresses, Torneko is able to store special 
items in the vault, which he is then able to bring 
with him on subsequent trips to the dungeon.

The war of 1999 left the country of Kookistan in 
shambles. Naturally, a dictator named General 
Akhboob took control of the beleagured nation and 
began creating an army of radioactive mutants. 
With a virtually impenetrable stronghold, a bunch 
of hostages, and a legion of mutants under his 
command, the evil despot will stop at nothing but 
world domination. Only two men have the courage 
and idealistic naivete to take on Akhboob and his 
forces: Captain Carnage and Major Mayhem, also 
known as the Doomsday Squad. 
 
As Captain Carnage or Major Mayhem, it is up to 
you or you and a friend (in simultaneous action) 
to rescue the hostages while shooting hundreds of 
mutants bent on your destruction. As you walk and 
run forward, backward, left, right, and diagonally 
through 20 battlezones of nonstop action, you'll 
always have your machine gun by your side. 
Additional weapons which you can find along the 
way include grenade launchers, rocket launchers, 
plasma machine guns, flame throwers, spray-fire 
rifles, defensive blades, and an assortment of 
bombs.

Treasure Hunter G (c) May 24, 1996 Sting, Inc. / 
Square Co., Ltd. 
 
Brothers Red and Blue G. decide to leave their 
idyllic village in search of their long lost 
father, who left the kids years ago to go treasure 
hunting. Unfortunately, as soon as they begin 
their quest, they become entangled with a 
mysterious girl on the run from evil monsters who 
holds the key to the resurrection of a great 
demon. Now its up to the brothers to save the 
world if they ever want to find their father. 
 
Treasure Hunter G is a top-down RPG in which you 
control your party of four characters as they 
explore the fantasy/sci-fi game world in search 
for quests and grinding their stats while the plot 
advances. The game is divided in a world-map 
screen, a top-down "town" mode and a turn-based 
fight mode in which the characters are taken to 
generic tiled top-down arenas in which they select 
each character and move or attack depending on 
their action points. 
 
Enemies can be seen on the map instead of jumping 
at you at random intervals, and you can freely 
decide whether to engage them or simply circle 
them around. The game uses a combination of 
hand-drawn sprites and CGI pre-rendered one 
(mostly for the main characters) with a distinct 
cute or Super Deformed design (as usual for most 
console RPGs).

The Twisted Tales of Spike McFang is an action-rpg 
starring the titular hero, a young vampire prince 
who must rescue his parents and save the 
inhabitants of the Vladamasco Islands from the 
evil Von Hesler. But is it really his handiwork, 
or is there someone else controlling him? Unravel 
the mystery while traveling to various locales, 
fighting Von Hesler's henchmen and picking up 
(CPU-controlled) companions along the way. 
 
Spike McFang has three main methods of attack: by 
striking out with his cape, throwing his hat like 
a boomerang, or using a magic card. Cards can also 
heal his health or give his companions extra 
strength. Spike can also devour the still-beating 
hearts of his vanquished foes (or the dropped 
tomatoes of his vanquished foes if you're playing 
the sanitized North American version) to regain 
health. There are a total of four different hats 
that Spike can purchase as upgrades in his battle 
against animated garlic bulbs, bomb-throwing cats, 
head-spinning plants and a plethora of other 
dangerous enemies.

BEC Co., Ltd. / Interbec 
 
Uchu no Kishi: Tekkaman Blade's is based on the 
anime Tekkaman Blade, also known as Teknoman. The 
game's levels are a mix of scrolling shooter and 
fighting game. The first part of every level is a 
scrolling shooter where Tekkaman Blade must 
survive several waves of Radam before killing two 
stronger boss-like Radam and meeting another 
Tekkaman. In scrolling shooter levels Blade can 
either toss his spear to defeat enemies at range 
or quickly slash with it to destroy bullets and 
enemies. One enemy type will drop different 
colored System Box powerups: green restores 
health, red destroys all enemies onscreen (except 
bosses), and blue turns Blade invulnerable and 
able to destroy all enemies upon contact 
(including bosses). 
 
The end of every level is a one on one fight with 
an enemy Tekkaman. Each Tekkaman starts with a 
weapon, but the weapon will be lost if they take 
too much damage, forcing them to use punches and 
kicks. This mode can also be played in 2-player 
mode, where each player selects their Tekkaman.

In the future, Earth must protect itself from 
alien invaders, a task handled by the Science 
Special Search Party. However, they are not alone 
in this endeavor. After crashing his ship on Earth 
while in pursuit of the evil alien Bemular, the 
super-being Ultraman is here to help whenever the 
attacking aliens prove too much for humanity alone 
to handle. Standing hundreds of feet tall with 
incredible strength and amazing abilities, he can 
only remain on Earth for a few minutes, and so 
must defeat his foes before his power drains 
completely. 
 
Based on the popular television show from 1967, 
Ultraman directly follows the story of its source 
material. Cast in the role of the titular 
Ultraman, the player must defeat many of the same 
monsters that appeared in the original series. 
Taking the appearance of a 1-on-1 fighting game, 
Ultraman can punch, kick, and grapple his 
opponent, as well as use a variety of various 
special moves that must be charged. However, in 
order to actually defeat his opponent, Ultraman 
must deplete their continually-recharging life 
bar, and at that moment hit with his most powerful 
special attack: the Specium Beam. As the game 
continues, different enemies may even find ways to 
avoid this most formidable attack, and Ultraman 
must adapt... Each stage has a time limit of only 
three minutes, and there are three lives and no 
continues.

Uniracers (c) Jun 01, 1994 DMA Design Limited / 
Nintendo of America Inc. 
 
What do you get if you cross Sonic the Hedgehog 
with Tony Hawk's Pro Skater? 
 
It might seem an odd combination, but it describes 
Uniracers perfectly. One of the more successful 
releases of the Super Nintendo's twilight era, 
Uniracers mixes platform-based high-speed racing, 
with crazy stunts and tricks. 
 
The basic idea in most levels of the game is 
simple. Get your unicycle from A to B as quickly 
as possible, and finish ahead of your opponent. 
It's like Sonic, but with none of those pesky 
enemies, pointless power-ups and frustrating 
obstructions. In fact it doesn't sound like much 
of a game at all... 
 
Here's the key, though. Tricks performed and 
landed during the race increase your speed. The 
better the trick, the greater your increase in 
speed will be. 
 
Also, some levels are set in areas designed solely 
for stunts. Such levels require you to earn as 
many style points as possible, by doing tricks. 
These levels are against the clock, and a set 
points score, rather than an opponent. 
 
Unicycles are stupid and difficult, and yet fun, 
once you get the hang of them. Much the same could 
be said about Uniracers...

than Colony Administrator for a new settlement on 
some far-flung planet. Your aim is to provide the 
highest Quality of Life rating for the colonists. 
 
You do so by ensuring that there is enough life 
support, power, housing, employment, police and 
entertainment to keep the citizens of your colony 
happy. Hindering your goal are random events such 
as solar eclipses (which can render your solar 
panels inactive) and also a different, hostile 
alien race that inhabits the planets in the many 
scenarios at offer. 
 
Not only do you have to be a good mayor but you 
also have to be a good general. Resources must not 
only be attributed to civilian research but into 
weapons research, intelligence and the building of 
tanks and spaceships, if you wish to survive long 
enough to see your colony flourish into a 
metropolis. As a rule, you will have built a 
strong colony before the aliens come, but the 
final push towards a QOL of 80% or higher can only 
be achieved once there is no outside threat.

Wario's Woods (c) Dec, 1994 Nintendo Co., Ltd. / 
Nintendo of America Inc. 
 
Wario's Woods is a puzzle game similar to Tetris 
or Columns, but with a twist. Instead of directly 
controlling the monsters and bombs that are 
falling down, the player controls Toad who has to 
carry around stacks of monsters and bombs and to 
combine them in the right way. One bomb plus at 
least two monsters of the same color have to be 
combined to make them disappear. If five or more 
objects are cleared at the same time, a diamond 
will appear. Destroying the diamond will clear all 
monsters of the diamond's color. 
There are four different ways to pick up objects. 
The A button lets Toad pick up the whole stack 
that is in front of him, the B button lets him 
only pick up one object, even if it's in the 
middle of a stack, the Y button lets him kick a 
monster or bomb that's in front of him and the X 
button places him on top of the stack that he is 
carrying. He can also run up walls and stacks to 
catch falling objects out of the air or to pick up 
certain parts of a stack. 
 
There are 5 different modes of play: a "Round 
Game" in which Toad has to clear numerous levels, 
a match versus a computer controlled opponent, a 
two player mode, a "Time Race" mode, and finally, 
an extensive training mode. 
 
There are some differences between the SNES and 
NES versions. Due to a lack of buttons, controls 
are a little different in the NES version 
(although all the moves from the SNES version are 
present). Also, there is no vs. mode against the 
computer, but the "Round Game" mode features two 
modes of play: one that includes boss-fights on 
every level ending with a 9.

In the year 2003 geneticists tried to create the 
perfect soldier. Something went wrong however, and 
three new life forms turned against their 
creators: Brutally savage Orcs, cybernetic 
androids called Cromes and genetically enhanced 
human soldiers code named M.A.R.S. Players take 
control of a secretly assembled force and must try 
to restore order. 
 
War 2410 is a turn-based strategy game in which 
players move various units, such as mechs, tanks, 
troops or planes over a grid-map. Units differ in 
movement and attacking range. Some ground units 
cannot attack air units and vice versa. Terrain 
also affects combat as some types of terrain, like 
trees or buildings improve a units defense. 
Attacked units always counterattack as long as the 
attacker is within range. The goal of most 
missions is to destroy all enemy units, while it 
is sometimes necessary to capture the enemies' 
bases. Units cannot not be improved or modified 
and every mission starts with all units already in 
place.

grave.  Years later, survivors of this disaster 
live on boats or man-made islands called Atolls.  
Everyone in this new world is looking for a 
mythical place called Dry Land, which people 
believe that there is a map to Dry Land on a 
little girl's back named Enola.  A band of pirates 
who live an oil tanker called the Smokers are 
after Dry Land and they are trying to get Enola 
for the tatoo on her back.  A nameless drifter who 
has adapted to the new world and this causes him 
to have gills and webbed feet, gets involved in 
this whole "quest for Dry Land" so to speak and 
becomes responsible for Enola and the woman who 
looks after her named Helen. 
 
You play as the nameless drifter only known as The 
Marnier.  You play through three types of 
gameplay.  The first type of gameplay involves you 
sailing in a some-what big area and clearing the 
area of Smokers. There is a second type of these 
sailing levels add something else.  You can save 
the Atollers from The Smokers.  The second type of 
gameplay is the swimming.  You swim underwater 
avoiding sea creatures and collecting items for 
money to use at the shop after you kill off 
Smokers on the Atolls.  Killing of The Smokers is 
the third type of gameplay. You run through the 
Atolls with your big knife at first and then you 
get three more weapons along the way which are a 
pistol, a speargun, and a machine gun.

and so on. Each level is played out against a time 
limit, and the paths through the level aren’t 
always clear-cut. There are four different types 
of doors, each of which needs a particular icon to 
pass (the icons represent the door type, such as 
ice or bricks, rather than hot water or a key, or 
anything you’d logically expect to clear the 
path). You can avoid the baddies, which may be the 
best option, as killing them costs you some energy 
–this reduces the significance of the points 
system.

WildSnake (c) 1994 J.S.C. Gamos / Spectrum 
Holobyte, Inc. 
 
WildSnake is a puzzle game in which the player 
must manage falling snakes in a  confined space 
and keep the snakes from reaching the top of the 
space. Snakes fall and slither until they reach a 
resting spot on the floor of the space. A snake 
will destroy any other snakes of the same color 
and pattern that it touches with its head on the 
way down, which often has the chain effect of 
loosening the pile of snakes so that all the 
snakes slither into new positions, possibly 
eliminating even more snakes. 
 
The game is played against a selection of 
backgrounds including desert, forest, water, or 
grass. Further, there are 7 game grids including 
the standard grid (a tall rectangle), X, plus, 
flask, Diabolo (an hourglass pattern), T-square, 
and obstacle (with a number of intermediate 
blocks). 
 
The player starts out as a nestling and earns 
higher and higher distinctions taken from the 
snake realm (garter snake, water snake, boa, 
mambo, python, king cobra, etc.) as more snakes 
are cleared. Also, as the level increases. more 
types of snake patterns must be handled. 
Sometimes, there is a flashing red snake that 
eliminates the first snake it touches. Further, 
there is occasionally an unstoppable snake that 
barrels down to the bottom of the space, 
eliminating all snakes in its path. 
 
The game can be played with 1 or 2 players in 
either easy, normal or hard mode. In the single 
player mode, the player can choose whether the 
preview showing the next snake will be shown. In 
2-player mode, there is always a preview window. 
In fact, there is a queue of 3 snakes between the 
2 player spaces from which the next snake is 
drawn. As a bonus during competition, multiple 
snake eliminations by one player result in 
obstacles appearing in the space of the opposing 
player.

Wild Guns (c) 1994 Natsume Co., Ltd. / Natsume, 
Inc. 
 
KABOOM! 
 
Annie & Clint, two gunslingers, arrive at Carson 
City and get caught up in a gunfight. It's raining 
bullets and there are explosions everywhere. After 
an intense battle they enter the saloon where they 
dispose of every cowboy in sight while 
redecorating the interior. Our heroes flee the 
scene by climbing on the roof, but what's that 
sound? ... it's a HUGE robot! 
 
Wild Guns is a shooter with a western & Sci Fi 
theme. Gameplay is somewhat similar to the Time 
Crisis & House of the Dead games, with the 
exception that the game isn't played from a 
first-person perspective but from a third-person 
perspective. You control your on-screen character 
as well as the aiming crosshair (at the same 
time). Select either Clint (yes, inspired by Mr. 
Eastwood) or Annie and shoot down tons of enemies 
while dodging bullets and jumping over incoming 
rockets. 
 
After the Carson City level, the action continues 
in Desolation Canyon, an ammunition depot, a gold 
mine and a armored train (you can play these 
levels in any order). Finally there's a showdown 
with the big bad guy. Each of the 6 levels is 
divided into 3 sublevels. The 3rd one is always a 
boss-battle. During the game your standard weapon 
can be temporarily upgraded by collecting 
power-ups. If you want to create some serious 
mayhem you can detonate one of your bombs. Almost 
any object in the background can be destroyed. 
 
Wild Guns has a two-player co-op mode. There's 
also a shooting gallery mode in which you can't 
die

Wings 2 - Aces High (c) 1992 Namco Limited / Namco

The game takes place during World War 1. Choose 
one of the five allied fighter pilots to do battle 
against the Central Powers. The game consists of 
20 missions with the final one culminating with a 
battle between the player and "The Red Baron". 
 
Missions are basically the same as in its' 
predecessor Wings. There are bombing missions 
where you have to take out targets that were 
circled in an aerial photograph, strafing runs 
where you get to blast anything that you fancy 
blasting with an unlimited supply of ammo, and of 
course the main part: dogfights in the sky. 
 
If a mission is completed successfully, the player 
can power up the successful pilot in four skill 
categories: flying, shooting, mechanics, and 
stamina. A failed mission can lead to either a 
dishonorable discharge or death for the pilot.

The Confederation have been at war with the 
Kilrathi for the past 20 years, and you're just 
now joining the Vega campaign. You're a 2nd 
Lieutenant just out of the Academy, with some good 
work under your belt. You're posted to Tiger's 
Claw, the flagship of the Confederation Fleet.  
Will you help the Confederation to victory, or go 
down in infamy? 
 
Wing Commander is a space combat simulator 
interspersed with shipboard dialogs. Onboard the 
ship, you can save/load game, visit the bar to get 
the latest gossip, or go on to the next mission 
briefing, and the 3D space combat part. 
 
The 3D space combat have you sitting in the 
cockpit, where you control the craft like roll, 
turn, up/down, afterburner, as well as fire guns 
and launch missiles. There are four different 
crafts on the Confed side, each with different 
flight characteristics and armament. You will have 
a wingman on each mission, and you should keep the 
wingman alive as the wingman will help you if you 
issue the right orders. You can also taunt the 
enemy. You'll be fighting several different types 
of enemy fighters and capital ships, and even 
combat a few Kilrathi aces. 
 
When the mission is complete, land back onboard 
the ship and get ready for the next one. The 
campaign tree have both winning and losing paths. 
 
Wing Commander featured a hybrid bitmap/3D 
graphics  engine that allowed even 286's to 
display detailed 3D graphics to an extent never 
before possible. With EMS available, it can 
display even more detailed graphics and in-cockpit 
animations.

Wing Commander - The Secret Missions (c) 1993 
Mindscape, Inc. / Mindscape, Inc. 
 
In the first Secret Missions add-on to Wing 
Commander, the TCS Tiger's Claw responds to a 
distress call from the Terran colony in the 
Goddard System. Once they arrive, they find that 
the colony has been completely destroyed by a new 
Kilrathi secret weapon, with no survivors. The 
Tiger's Claw is then ordered to pursue the 
Kilrathi fleet into their own space and destroy 
this new weapon - without reinforcements or the 
ability to resupply... 
 
The Secret Missions campaign adds 16 new missions 
to fly. Unlike the main game, there is no 
branching mission tree - progress is linear. There 
are also several new ships: a Confederation 
corvette, Kilrathi and Confederation freighters 
and of course the Kilrathi dreadnought with the 
secret weapon itself. 
 
Characters from the main game can be transferred 
into the add-on, which also includes a "Mission

original game.

The Wizard of Oz for the SNES is a re-telling of 
L. Frank Baum's classic story as strongly 
influenced by MGM's 1939 musical.  To a lesser 
degree, individual levels adapt locations from the 
1993 Wizard of Oz Animated Series by DIC by using 
settings from the series, such as Time Town. 
 
The game is a platform adventure, which highly 
encourages exploration.  The action is split into 
four worlds.  In each of the first three worlds, 
the Scarecrow, Tin Man, and Lion can be found, 
while in the last rather than gain a companion the 
witch must be fought.  After gaining a companion, 
the characters may be switched on the fly, and 
each companion has significantly different attacks 
and abilities.  Several of the levels require 
using a combination of all of these abilities to 
fully explore. The game also includes a variety of 
mini-games which gives the player a chance to play 
as Toto also. 
 
All levels can be revisited once passed and doing 
so required both for the purposes of stocking up 
on items and to find the Emerald City tickets 
which are required to enter the final area.

id software's adaptation of their classic

changes as well as new additions. 
 
While the basic gameplay of exploring levels, 
shooting enemies, collecting treasures, keys and 
power-ups remain the same, only half of the 
original game's 60 levels have been retained. Each 
of those 30 levels (grouped into six missions, 
with two levels being secret ones) is a simplified 
version of an original level. The end bosses for 
the missions are taken from both Wolf3D as well as 
its sequel, Spear of Destiny. 
 
Other changes from the original include new 
power-ups: an ammo box (taken from Spear of 
Destiny) and backpack that increases the maximum 
amount of ammo that can be carried. 
 
The original's weapons (knife, pistol, machine 
gun, chaingun) all return, but there are also two 
completely new tools of destruction: a flame 
thrower and a rocket launcher.

Wonder Project J - Kikai no Shounen Pino (c) Dec 
08, 1994 Almanic Corp. / Enix Corporation 
 
There was once a great scientist and inventor 
named Gepetto, who lived on an island farm 
together with his creations, his robotic helper, 
the pixie Tinker, and his pet animals. His 
greatest creation was an artificial boy named 
Pino. No, he was not carved from wood, but looked 
just like a real boy - only he could turn his head 
360 degrees. But Gepetto was arrested for an 
unknown reason. The boy Pino looks like a real 
boy, but he was completed just a few moments ago, 
and he knows absolutely nothing. All he can do is 
wander aimlessly, poking objects and turning his 
head. It is up to you, the player, to make Pino a 
real man! 
 
In this simulation/role-playing game, you must use 
the robotic pixie Tinker to educate Pino. You can 
move Tinker around, examining objects and 
collecting them in an adventure-like fashion. Pino 
will automatically follow you to the direction you 
are facing, but will continue walking until you 
stop him. He will also pick objects and make his 
own "experiments" with them. Your goal is to train 
PIno in various disciplines. His stats can be 
raised in a RPG style: reading books increases his 
intelligence, throwing a ball increases his 
dexterity, and so on. By praising or scolding Pino 
you will gradually make him understand what should 
be done and what not.

The original eight characters from the popular 
arcade hit return, along with six new characters 
hand-picked from several different eras and 
locations all through time. But a new boss awaits 
the victor... who or what is behind this new 
tournament? You'll have to get to him to find out! 
 
This sequel features all-new stages and music, and 
improved animation and graphics. You can now 
reflect projectile moves at your opponent, and 
reverse normal throws if your timing is right! The 
original game's Death Match mode is also back, but 
with a new feature - the life bar will increase or 
decrease as you inflict or receive damage. Get 
your side's life bar to 100% and your enemy will 
lose.

WWF Wrestlemania: The Arcade Game merges the 
personalities and action of the popular WWF TV 
show characters with a Mortal Kombat-style 
fighting game. This title features digitized 
graphics of 8 WWF superstars: Doink, Razor Ramon, 
Bret "Hit Man" Hart, Shawn Michaels, The 
Undertaker, Yokozuna, Bam Bam Bigelow, and Lex 
Luger. 
 
Although it is a wrestling title, this game is 
structured a lot like a one-on-one fighter. It is 
very fast-paced, and features crazy special moves. 
Also, each match is divided into a series of 
rounds, much like a fighting game. Instead of each 
round ending in a KO, each round simply ends when 
you force the other wrestler(s) to fall by 
reducing their energy meter. Game modes include 
single player arcade mode, tournament mode, and vs 
mode for 1-on-1 multiplayer.

Xardion (c) 1992 Jorudan Co., Ltd. / Asmik Corp. 
of America 
 
Xardion tells the tale of 3 warring planets that 
are home to 3 distinct alien races. Their fighting 
is interrupted by the threat of invasion from a 
much more potent alien race. The 3 planets find 
that they are able to set aside their differences 
long enough to battle their shared menace. 
 
Each planet sends a warrior to deal with the 
threat. There is a robot named Triton, a cat-like 
quadruped named Panthera, and a giant red bipedal 
insect alien name Alcedes. The single player of 
the game controls one of these characters at a 
time and can switch at any time. If the current 
character loses all of his health, the player is 
sent back to the start of the level and that one 
character receives a health refill. 
 
Each character has special attributes that help 
the team. For example, Panthera's relatively small 
size allows him to squeeze into spots where the 
other 2 characters can not travel. The characters 
can gather a number of unique powerups and weapons 
to help them on their mission.

X-Men - Mutant Apocalypse (c) 1994 Capcom Co., 
  Ltd. / Capcom U.S.A., Inc. 
 
Because of a rise of anti-mutant activity in 
Genosha, Professor Xavier uses Cerebro to scan the 
island nation and discovers Apocalypse's presence 
there. Genosha's government is apparently using 
Apocalypse to bring their mutant population under 
control. However, Xavier suspects Apocalypse to 
follow his own plans and sends five X-Men, 
Cyclops, Wolverine, Psylocke, Beast and Gambit, to 
investigate. 
 
X-Men: Mutant Apocalypse combines the gameplay 
  of a side-scrolling brawler like Final Fight 
  with elements of a platformer, that is, players 
  have to fight various enemies and survive the 
  occasional jumping-puzzle. Most levels also 
  feature mid- and end-bosses in form of robots, 
  monsters or known Super-Villains. 
 
Each character has unique abilities and special 
moves: Cyclops uses his Optic Blast to attack 
enemies from a distance, Wolverine can climb 
walls, Psylocke is very agile and the best jumper 
of the team, Beast can cling to the ceiling while 
Gambit throws explosive cards at his enemies. 
Special moves are quite similar to those found in 
Street Fighter II (Wolverine has a 
Dragon-Punch-style attack and Gambit's Double Kick 
is virtually identical to M. Bison's Scissors 
Kick), and require similar button combinations. 
 
While most stages are unique for each character, 
some can be played with any of the X-Men. Progress 
is saved via password.

A young boy has a strange dream every night, where 
a voice calls him. In this dream there's a magical 
kingdom called Enderia. The queen of Enderia and 
her daughters were kidnapped by the demon Akuma, 
who now reigns supreme. The boy must enter the 
dreamworld, defeat the demon and rescue the 
nobility. 
 
This is a first-person dungeon crawler with 
step-movement and random encounters that plays 
like a simplified version of the Dungeon Master 
series template, as it were. One of the main 
differences compared to that venerable game series 
is the presentation. Instead of the usual dank and 
dark dungeon, with grim walls with rusty chains, 
this game has surfaces made of cake and candy. 
Instead of skeletons and orcs as the enemy, it has 
furry and cute anthropomorphic animals. Once 
defeated, occasionally this creatures leave behind 
their skin, which you can collect and wear for a 
change in statistics and new abilities. They also 
sometimes drop candy, the game's currency. There's 
several shops sprinkled in each level: a tailor 
shop to change and store skins (you can carry a 
maximum of six skins), shops for potions and 
health boosts, etc. 
 
The battle system is unique. As one of the many 
random enemy encounters occurs, a menu appears 
with the Fight and Escape options. After choosing 
Fight, another menu pops up with Punch, Kick, 
Talent, Defend and Item. After choosing Punch or 
Kick the player is presented with a grid where a 
icon (a fist or a foot) can be positioned over a 
part of the enemy body. This provides a strategic 
element to the game, different enemies have 
different weak spots that can be exploited. The 
Talent option access the special ability that a 
skin may have.

grapple the hell out of your opponent until one of 
you emerges victorious. You can attack your 
opponent with several moves (unique to each 
character) and upon "locking-on" by getting too 
close to the other wrestler you can execute 
grapples and throws. 
 
The game uses 2D graphics from a heightened camera 
view and includes a plethora of game modes 
including single player Championship and 
Tournament modes (with single or Tag variants for 
both), 2 Player Vs., Team Battle, and a Training 
in which you can learn the basics of the game.

Zig Zag Cat - Ostrich Club mo Oosawagi da (c) Jun 
24, 1994 Den'Z / Den'Z 
 
Restoring the lands from evil, saving the 
princess, and finding a way back home might not be 
the most original of goals, but how many games 
also include the comedy stylings of Japanese 
performance group Dachou Club? Not many, that's 
for sure! 
 
Zig Zag Cat is an unusual fusion of Breakout and a 
scrolling shooter. During action stages the 
player's avatar walks forward while attempting to 
keep their cat from bouncing off the bottom of the 
screen. The cat can break most obstacles by 
hitting them, and all obstacles will be broken if 
they collide with the avatar. By breaking blocks 
money and temporary paddle upgrades can be 
uncovered, such as ones that increase the size or 
the paddle, let you fire bullets, or allow you to 
curve the cat while it is moving. Several times 
during each stage a black octopus block will 
appear, and it must be destroyed by the cat before 
the player's avatar will continue moving forward. 
While the avatar is totally unharmed from walking 
through any enemies or blocks, some enemies and 
all bosses have the ability to fire projectiles at 
him which do cause damage, and if all health is 
lost from projectiles then a life will be lost 
just as if the cat had fallen off the screen. 
 
In between action stages the player will enter an 
Inn. At the Inn he can save, talk to the locals, 
play a bonus board to earn additional money, buy 
temporary paddle upgrades, and check his progress 
on his trip around the island.

Zoop (c) Jan, 1996 Hookstone Ltd. / Viacom New 
Media 
 
Fast-paced action-puzzle game where the player 
eliminates colored shapes that are approaching his 
alter ego, another colored shape, before they 
reach the top, ala Tetris. 
 
In order to eliminate the other shapes, you must 
point your piece at it and 'fire'. If the shape is 
the same color as your piece, the shape is 
eliminated, as well as all of the shapes of the 
same color behind it, until your piece hits a 
piece of a different color. If the shape is of a 
different color, or it is hit when collecting a 
line of similar shapes, your piece exchanges 
colors with the shape.
