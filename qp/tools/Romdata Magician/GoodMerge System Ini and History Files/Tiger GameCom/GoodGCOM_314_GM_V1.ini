In addition to battling such boss characters as Poison Ivy and Bane, you must also fling batarangs at thugs in special sequences played from a first-person perspective. Stop Mr. Freeze and retrieve Gotham City's missing diamonds to win the game.

Description=In Centipede, you control a ship that shoots vertically and moves in all directions along the bottom 1/4th of the playfield. You must fire at a multi-segmented centipede that starts at the top of the screen and crawls its way through a garden of mushrooms. Each time the centipede or a segment of the centipede hits a mushroom, it will turn the other way and continue its descent. If any portion of the centipede reaches the bottom of the screen, it reverses direction and begins crawling upward. This is unlike Space Invaders, in which you lose a life when an invader reaches the bottom of the playfield.When you shoot a segment of the centipede, it turns into a mushroom. After you have destroyed the entire centipede, another will take its place. In addition to centipedes, you must contend with horizontally moving scorpions, falling fleas and bouncing spiders. The closer you are to a spider when you shoot it, the more points you will get. Fleas leave behind a trail of mushrooms while scorpions poison existing mushrooms. You lose a life any time a creature collides with your ship.In this game.com version of Centipede, you can choose between the classic Arcade style or an updated version. The updated mode of play contains higher resolution graphics with more detail and, according to the instruction manual, is slightly more difficult. You can also set the speed at which your ship moves, choose the level at which to start, and select from three difficulty levels (easy, medium and hard). If you feel more comfortable with the directional pad on the right side of your game.com unit instead of the traditional left position, you can flip the screen.

Review=Review by Brett Alan Weiss<br><br>Like most people, when I crack open a fresh videogame, I always play it for awhile before I read the instruction manual or check out the options, especially when it's an easy-to-learn title like Centipede for game.com. When I first began playing this handheld rendition of the Arcade classic, I was very disappointed as the ship moved much too slowly. Luckily, after a few minutes of frustration, I consulted the manual and options and was pleasantly surprised to discover that the default setting is for slow and that you can crank up the speed of the ship to medium or fast. Thus, the fun began and I spent a good chunk of the afternoon blowing away and avoiding centipedes, spiders and other creepy creatures.During the early 1980s, Centipede was one of my favorite Arcade games, and I'm pleased to report that it holds up nicely after two decades and numerous home versions. This is a competent port of a more than competent game. It features the same type of addictive and intense gameplay as the original (sans the track ball, of course) and keeps the distinctive audio intact, right down to the high-pitched, but daunting sound effects when the spider pays a visit. Obviously, the centipedes are the stars of the show in every version, but the pouncing spiders deserve some credit for the game's longevity -- the fact that you can score more points for shooting them while they are close to you is an inspired bit of programming. The varying mushroom fields, which determine the paths of the centipedes, are also a brilliant creation.In addition to a faithfully adapted classic Centipede, game.com owners also get an updated edition, which features detailed centipedes and textured mushrooms. The centipedes are viewed from the side and are given eyes and antennae. This modern take on an old favorite is nice, and I appreciate the enhanced visuals, but it plays basically the same as the original game. I would have preferred Millipede, which was the sequel to Centipede, to have been included in the package. After all, Williams Arcade Classics for the same system is composed of a whopping five different games.<br><br>Graphics (4)<br> The animation is jerky and there's not a lot of depth here, but the game does a decent job of keeping the basic look of the original Arcade classic intact. Also, the updated version looks nice without sacrificing gameplay.<br><br>Sound (5)<br> The popping sounds of the mushrooms assuming full form between rounds remain intact. This is but one example of how this game sounds faithful to the original. One disappointment I have in this area is the tepid rendition of the little victory song after you win an extra life. Also, the sound effects aren't as strong as those found in Williams Arcade Classics.<br><br>Enjoyment (7)<br> Although I've played Centipede on numerous systems throughout the years (one would assume to the point of burnout), I found this version to be fun and exciting.<br><br>Replay Value (6)<br> Keep chasing after those high scores and you'll play the game until your thumbs are sore.<br><br>Documentation (3)<br> The manual is a cheaply made fold out, but it tells you what you need to know.

Description=Duke Nukem is a foul-mouthed, muscle-bound gun nut with a craving for mayhem and anything in a skirt. His trash talking, weapon-enhanced bravado comes in handy in when aliens attack Earth. These invaders from outer space are hell-bent on enslaving the world and performing cruel biogenetic experiments on unwilling human females. In the immortal words of Duke himself, "No one takes our chicks and lives..."Your mission in Duke Nukem 3D is to frag (kill) as many aliens as you can as you work your way through the various rooms and areas in three episodes of play: L.A. Meltdown, Lunar Apocalypse and Shrapnel City. You can select which level you would like to enter first. There are four types of aliens for your killing pleasure, including Assault Troops, Pig Cops, Enforcers and Octobrains.You begin the game with your standard weapon, a pistol, which lets you fire six rounds in succession before you have to reload. Be careful when reloading as it leaves you temporarily vulnerable. Whenever you find a clip, it will add six rounds to your stash. You can carry up to 200 bullets.For more power and a wider burst, you can find a shotgun, which you must pump to reload every time after firing. Pumping leaves you vulnerable for about a second. To increase your ammo supply, you can pick up boxes containing six shells. The most shells you can tote around are 50.The Rocket Propelled Launcher (RPG) is the most explosive of the weapons you can find. It kills all onscreen enemies with a single shot. Cases of RPG ammunition contain five rounds. You can only carry 50 rounds at a time. If you run completely out of ammo for all weapons, your boot is your only means of attack. This is a weak weapon to say the least.As you progress through the game, ridding the world of alien scum, you'll need to find key cards for use in opening certain doors. You can also find med kits to increase your health and armor to protect you from enemy firepower. Skill levels in Duke Nukem 3D include Piece of Cake, Let's Rock, Come Get Some and Damn I'm Good. A password feature, which lets you restart a game from the level you die on, is also available.

Description=Virtua Fighter 2 and Fighting Vipers, a pair of arcade hits from Sega, combine to form Fighters Megamix for the game.com system. You can play the game by yourself or challenge a friend to a few rounds. Two-player games require two game.com systems, two cartridges and a Head-2-Head cable.This hybrid videogame lets you choose from eight different fighters: Akira Yuki, Pai, Lion and Jacky from Virtua Fighter 2 and Bahn, Candy, Sanman and Mahler from Fighting Vipers. By winning a certain number of fights (and therefore completing courses), you can unlock hidden characters from Sega's Daytona USA and Virtua Cop.The characters vary in fighting styles and abilities. For example, Bahn's strength lies in the power of his standing punches while Lion uses his uncanny speed to his advantage. While all the fighters can walk and run left and right, punch, kick, dodge, block, duck and jump, you must experiment with the controls to discover their individual special moves. Fights in this game consist of a series of best two-out-of-three matches. Every time your character gets hit, his or her health meter will diminish. A few of the fighters wear armor, which, until it breaks, reduces some of the damage taken from hits. Blocking also cuts down on the degree of damage taken. The fights are timed, so you should finish each course as quickly as possible.Options in the 1P Mode of Fighters Megamix let you choose from three skill levels, three round lengths and three time limits. The VS Mode adds the option of letting you shorten or lengthen the life power (health meter) of each fighter.A special Survival Mode lets you fight as many opponents as you can defeat. Fights in this mode only last one round and you are allowed only one life bar. You get to decide how long you want fights to last (3, 7 or 15 minutes).If you've slapped more quarters into Virtual Fighter 2 and Fighting Vipers than you care to admit, yet you still yearn to crack some skulls, slap Fighters Megamix into your game.com system and knock yourself out. Or better yet, knock out your opponent.

Description=Frogger challenges players to maneuver a little frog from the bottom of the screen to the top, while dodging numerous obstacles along the way. Now you can enjoy this harrowing experience on the go with Frogger for the game.com handheld system.The bottom half of the playfield in Frogger is a highway that is apparently experiencing rush hour traffic. Cars, trucks and other vehicles zoom down this road, their drivers obviously not concerned whether or not a frog is trying to get to the other side. If you make it across the road, you will land on a sidewalk that stretches across the middle of the screen.Then you must hop across a river (comprising most of the top half of the playfield) that is teeming with logs, turtles, alligators and snakes. You can bum a ride on the logs and turtles and on the backs of the alligators, but you should be careful of diving turtles and the jaws of the alligators. Also, do not float all the way to the right or left side of the screen. For bonus points, you can rescue a white lady frog that appears from time to time.Five home bays are positioned along the top of the screen. Your objective is to hop your frog into one of these bays before the timer runs out. If you catch a fly in the bay, you will get bonus points. However, you should try your best not to hop into a bay that is occupied by an alligator head.After you fill all five bays, you will be treated to a brief musical tune. The game will then continue at a brisker pace with faster traffic, fewer logs in the river and an increased number of alligators and snakes. The game ends when all your frogs are dead.This version of Frogger features two modes of play: Classic, which emulates the original, and Updated for the '90s, which features detailed graphics and slightly harder gameplay. Also, for all you left handers out there, you can flip the screen.

Review=Review by Brett Alan Weiss<br><br>Frogger for game.com includes Classic mode, which faithfully reproduces the arcade original, and Updated, which has more detailed graphics and slightly harder gameplay. To accommodate the small screen, there are just three lanes of traffic and three lanes of river obstacles (as opposed to five each). Also different is that certain later levels are all traffic or all river (as opposed to half and half). Confoundingly, the game ends after a certain number of levels, instead of continuing indefinitely at a harder and harder pace. As with many game.com titles, the sound effects and music in this game are strong, even featuring a rousing rendition of "Camptown Races."

Description=Meet HENRY, a sound and picture matching game for the game.com portable unit. HENRY's playfield is a four-by-four grid of 16 squares, each square hiding a randomly chosen sound and picture. Your job is to match the clue HENRY gives you with its corresponding sound and picture. The visual clues appear one at a time in a window on the right side of the screen. When you or your opponent (the computer or a friend) finds a matching pair, the square will light.When four squares in a row are lit up, horizontally, vertically or diagonally, the game will end. Whoever makes the final match in the row is the winner. If you aren't up to challenging the computer or a human opponent, you can select Practice Mode, which lets you take every turn. The goal here is to hone your skills to the point where you can light four squares in a row without a mistake. You can also choose to play the game with only visual clues or only sound clues.HENRY contains 80 sounds and phrases in its memory banks, including "Four score and seven years ago," "Happy Birthday," "Good day, mate" and "Gong!" Visual images include apples, leaves, footballs, pencils, eyeglasses, globes and other commonplace items.

Review=Review by Brett Alan Weiss<br><br>Played on a four-by-four grid of 16 squares, each square hiding a randomly chosen sound and picture, HENRY is a matching game that is extremely limited in scope. There are 80 sounds and phrases in its memory banks, but the only way to win the game is to get the fourth match in a diagonal or horizontal line. A tournament mode (or other form of extended play) and a game in which the player with the most matches wins would help. The apples, footballs, and other objects are boring in design, but a number of whimsical sound effects, such as accented voices, a baby crying, and bells ringing, give the game a little personality. Although not mentioned anywhere on the package or in the manual, HENRY is strictly a children's game -- and not a very fun one at that.

Description=Choose from three different cars to drive in INDY 500 for the game.com. The cars vary in quickness of acceleration, road-gripping abilities and top speeds. You can choose standard or manual transmission, and you can race in either sunshine or rain. There are two camera angles from which to choose: above and behind the car and above and slightly behind the front tires. Prior to an actual race, you must drive four laps in a time trial to determine your starting position relative to the other 33 cars. A pace car will stay just ahead of you.When the real INDY 500 begins, you must race 10, 15 or 20 laps (depending on the chosen difficulty level) within an allotted period of time. As you speed down the straightaways and hug the corners of sharp turns, you must attempt to pass other cars in order to improve your position in the race.If you have too many accidents with other cars and/or you repeatedly crash into walls, your car will become damaged, slowing it down tremendously. You must also watch for road hazards. When the PIT symbol flashes on screen, let off the gas and take a hard right to enter the pit stop. While in the pits, you'll lose some time, but your car will be restored to tiptop condition.If you are successful in a race, the computer will ask you if you would like to progress to a higher level.

Review=Review by Brett Alan Weiss<br><br>The game.com, the little system that (almost) could, constantly amazes me with the strength and scope of its sound effects. The Arcade-like sounds of Williams Arcade Classics and the loud dinosaur rampages of The Lost World: Jurassic Park are mind blowing. INDY 500 continues this trend of ear-boggling sounds with its roaring engines, squealing tires, convincing car crashes and the clarity with which the starting announcer speaks. It's astounding what power comes out of such a tiny little speaker.In addition to realistic sounds, INDY 500 has realistic gameplay. Jockeying for position on the track, trying to nudge your way from the middle of the pack to the forefront of the race, is a difficult task. Unlike many racing games, in which you can weave in and out of cars like a teenager trying to impress a prom date, each car you come upon in this game incites a singular battle of gas pedals, steering wheels and brakes.The game.com doesn't always boast the smoothest animation, and INDY 500 is no exception. When you get too close to the side of the track, the car goes from cruising along nicely to slamming into a wall in the blink of an eye. However, for a handheld game played on a small gray screen, INDY 500 does a good job of simulating high speeds. The walls and pavement pass by jerkily but convincingly, and the clouds coming up over the horizon are a very nice touch.INDY 500 is a solid racing title, but it does have a couple of faults. After extended racing, the gameplay gets redundant. Slowing down for and then speeding up after left turn after left turn after left turn... Well, you get the picture; just like in real INDY racing, the course in this game is an oval. Some twists and turns would have been nice.It's hard to fault realism, but it is easy to fault boredom. And bored is what you'll get after you've had this game in your possession for a few days. Perhaps an INDY purist would be kinder to this game in this respect. After all, racing fans do get quite excited about watching cars on television go around in circles for hours on end.The time trials in which you must participate prior to every race are also a source of redundancy. Once you actually start a race, the pit stops are the pits. It's cool that you can hear the cars passing while you are getting your car worked on, but you have no control over the game once you actually make a pit stop. Even in Pit Stop (an appropriate title, if there ever was one) for the ancient ColecoVision, you could change tires yourself. In this game, you just watch the crew at work. In many ways, INDY 500 is a technological marvel and a worthy racing game. It looks and sounds very good, especially for a handheld game. Also, while you won't get an adrenaline rush while playing the game, the racing action is solid and realistic. Unfortunately, redundancy wins out in the end.<br><br>Graphics (7)<br> The cars and the sky are very well drawn. The wrecks look especially cool.<br><br>Sound (8)<br> You won't believe your ears.<br><br>Enjoyment (5)<br> Passing cars and racing at high speeds is fun for a time.<br><br>Replay Value (3)<br> There's a certain sameness to all of the turns.

Description=The Lost World: Jurassic Park takes place on a secret island known as Site B. Before Jurassic Park failed, this was the island that was used to supply the dinosaur park with its creatures. In this game, you control either Roland Tembo, a hunter wanting to take dinosaur eggs back to the main land, or Sarah Harding, an anthropologist wanting to retrieve the dinosaur eggs and keep them out of Tembo's hands.Each of the six levels in this game is divided into two sections: Game Trail and Nest Area. In the Game Trail portions of the game, you must drive along a dirt, grass or gravel road, avoiding dinosaurs as they stampede past you. You must also watch for rocks, bushes and other road hazards. The Game Trail is viewed from a first-person perspective. Vehicles at your disposal include a motorcycle, an RV mobile lab, an RV 3, a humvee cargo carrier, a humvee snagger and a humvee.The Nest Area is a platform adventure contest in which you must search for five dinosaur eggs. As you run, climb, crawl and jump through the jungles, an arrow indicator points in the direction of the next egg. Since you are intruding in their habitat, dinosaurs will attack you. To help ward them off, you will be issued tranquilizer darts. If you play as Harding, you will also have flares. Tembo's alternate weapon is a sonic screamer.After finding all five eggs in a Nest Area, you must find the exit. Be careful, though, because the Mother Dinosaur will be on guard.

Review=Review by Brett Alan Weiss<br><br>The Lost World: Jurassic Park looks fantastic. The jungles are thick and detailed, huge dinosaurs roam the backgrounds and nicely drawn all-terrain vehicles cruise around assorted obstacles while dodging sprinting dinosaurs. This is a lot going on for a black-and-white portable system. Unfortunately, the over-abundance of graphical content can get in the way of the action. The foreground dinosaurs oftentimes blend in with some of the shorter trees, especially when the playfield is scrolling, and the busy backgrounds only add to the confusion.Like most game.com games, The Lost World: Jurassic Park has superior sound effects. Powerful dinosaur growls emit from the tiny speaker. The music, however, is lightweight for a game of this type.In terms of shear action, the game is mediocre. Searching for the dinosaur eggs is a workable and challenging concept, but poor controls steal much of the enjoyment. When you push the jump button, your character waits a moment before jumping. This can be very frustrating. The driving scenes are largely pointless, but they look good and they are a change of pace from the standard gameplay.When you do find all five eggs in a level, you will have a feeling of accomplishment. It can be a difficult task. Even if the graphics don't confuse you, it is hard to keep the dinosaurs from killing you.The Lost World: Jurassic Park is a decent game, but Alien 3 for Sega's portable Game Gear is far superior. Alien 3 has accurate controls, better monster-killing action and superior weapons.<br><br>Graphics (6)<br> The visuals are impressive, but they can confuse the action.<br><br>Sound (6)<br> The dinosaurs sound great, but the music is wimpy.<br><br>Enjoyment (4)<br> I enjoyed exploring the jungles and finding the eggs, but the controls could use some fine-tuning, and another, more powerful weapon wouldn't hurt.<br><br>Replay Value (3)<br> Once you beaten this game, you'll probably feel that you've had enough.<br><br>Documentation (5)<br> The manual explains things fairly well.

If you land on a property, you will be given the chance put it up for auction or buy it if it isn't already owned. You can also purchase railroads and utilities.If you own all two or three properties in a particular group (such as Boardwalk and Park Place), you can begin building houses on them. After you have built four houses on one property, you can then upgrade to one hotel. When an opponent lands on your property, he or she must pay you rent. If you don't have enough money to purchase a property, you can raise cash by mortgaging property or selling houses or hotels. You can also attempt to trade properties with other players.There are several non-property squares you may land on. These include Chance and Community Chest, which have you draw a card and follow the instructions, Go! which when landed on or passed will grant you money, and Tax, which insists that you pay the amount indicated. Other squares include Jail, Just Visiting and Free Parking. To get out of jail, you must roll doubles, pay $50 or use a "Get Out of Jail Free" card.This version of Monopoly lets you turn on or off a number of options. These include the following: Short Game (in which players begin with several properties), Landing on Go Doubles Salary, Have Auctions for Properties (that are landed on and not bought), One Lap Required Before Purchasing, Infinite Buildings in Bank (as opposed to 32 houses and 12 hotels) and Transactions Allowed from Jail. You can also decide whether or not you want sound and animation.You go bankrupt in Monopoly and thus forfeit the game if you owe rent to another player and lack the assets to pay.

Description=What do you get when you cross 2D fighters Mortal Kombat, Mortal Kombat II and Mortal Kombat 3? Why, Mortal Kombat Trilogy, of course!The successor to the arcade megahits, Mortal Kombat Trilogy continues their bloody, ruthlessly violent tradition, this time in handheld form. The game features Rayden, Kitana, Reptile, Shao Kahn (the Dark Emperor scheming to control Earth) and seven other Kombatants from the earlier Mortal Kombat games. Familiar backgrounds are included as well.Each of the fighters in this game can punch, kick (low and high), block, crouch, jump and run. You can experiment with the controls to "chain" certain moves together to create combos, which reel off a flurry of attacks against the opponent. In addition to fighting moves and combos, each character possesses expert special moves such as Lightning, Teleport Kick, Forceball, Hatchet Uppercut, and Shoulder Dash.Fights in this game are played out in a one-on-one, best two-out-of-three format. Meters at the top of the screen display each character's degree of health. Every time you are hit, your Health Meter diminishes. If you land enough hits on your opponent, you will fill your Aggressor Meter, which makes you much stronger and able to inflict heavier damage on your opponent.Four skill levels are available in Mortal Kombat Trilogy: Very Easy, Easy, Medium and Hard. There are also four destinies (Novice, Warrior, Master and Champion) from which to choose. You can turn the Blood, Timer and Aggressor modes on or off. Play modes include Tournament, which has you battling your way up the food chain of Kombatants, and VS. Kombat, which pits you against a human opponent. To play against a friend, you must have two game.com systems, two Mortal Kombat Trilogy cartridges, and a Head 2 Head link cable.

Description=Unlike video game versions of Jeopardy, which wrap the trivialities and tidbits of interesting information inside a fun and engrossing game show format, Quiz Wiz is simply a series questions and answers. Up to three players can compete, but there are no bonus rounds, no prize packages, and no nifty game boards. More than 1,500 multiple-choice questions are spread among five categories: sports, famous people, film and TV, potpourri, and general knowledge. The host looks pretty decent and speaks clearly (if redundantly), and the animations are choppy and repetitive. Worse, too many of the questions are unnecessarily easy, making even the least informed gamer feel like a whiz kid.

Review=Review by Brett Alan Weiss<br><br>The packaging for Quiz Wiz says that it is a game of "cyber trivia" and that it is a "really cool way to widen your wisdom." Quiz Wiz is indeed a trivia contest, but you'll hardly gain wisdom by answering questions about Family Ties, NBA basketball and Cindy Crawford. The game does have questions about science, history and other substantive subjects, but you won't need the wisdom of King Solomon to be good at answering the questions, just a well-rounded knowledge of popular culture, both past and present.Company hyperbole aside, Quiz Wiz is little more than a trivia book in disguise. Unlike video game versions of Jeopardy, which wrap the trivialities and tidbits of interesting information inside a fun and engrossing game show format, Quiz Wiz is simply a series of questions and answers. Up to three players can compete, but there are no bonus rounds, no prize packages and no nifty game boards. In other words, Quiz Wiz can be as boring as school.Cutting edge graphics aren't exactly the first thing you look for in a trivia game, but the host of Quiz Wiz is recognizable as the Gen-Xer wannabe on the box. On the other hand, the animations that transpire as the result of an answered (right or wrong) question are choppy and redundant, and the questions and answers are presented in simple text.The voice effects are clear, but they're as redundant as the animations. The introductory music, which features jamming electric guitars, is designed to give the game an air of coolness, just like the box. Perhaps it's hard to get teenagers, the primary players of video games, to think a trivia contest is cool.Some of the questions in this game are way too easy. For example, when the game presents the question of how many keys are on a piano, its multiple choice answers are 2, 5, 88, and 1,899. Obviously, the answer is 88. Why not throw in 99, 101 or another reasonable number as one of the answers, just to make the question challenging? The trivia itself, though, isn't the real problem with Quiz Wiz as there are plenty of questions that ride the fine line of the esoteric and the familiar. The real problem with this game lies in its format: there is no real game here, just a bunch of questions and answers.There is one use for Quiz Wiz not yet mentioned. No, it can't be used as a doorstop as it is much too small. The game is actually ideal for long trips, especially since the whole family can get involved. You'll find questions involving subjects ranging from professional boxing to soap operas to rap music to The Roy Rogers Show to the Solar System. You can pass the game all around the car, letting each player have a turn; it beats the heck out of singing 99 Bottles of Beer on the Wall.<br><br>Graphics (3)<br> The graphics are limited and flat, but what do you expect from a trivia contest?<br><br>Sound (3)<br> The voice effects are clear but annoying.<br><br>Enjoyment (3)<br> Answering trivia questions isn't inherently lame, but Quiz Wiz needs a legitimate game to go along with the questions and answers.<br><br>Replay Value (2)<br> The instructions boast that there are more than 1,500 questions; surely the game.com could handle at least twice that many.<br><br>Documentation (5)<br> The manual does a reasonably good job of describing this simplistic game.

Description=Racoon City was once an idyllic and prosperous burg; its businesses were thriving and its residents were peaceful and happy. Then rumors of an accident at a mountain lab began circulating, instilling fear and loathing in the wilderness community. Strange creatures began appearing and countless citizens fled for their lives. Many were found dead. The stench of rotting human flesh soiled the formerly pristine air as zombies flooded the streets and fires lit the night skies.In an effort to stop the madness, the Racoon City Police Department recruited a crop of new officers, including the highly touted Leon S. Kennedy. You must guide the rookie cop through the streets and buildings of Racoon City to find out what happened and help him set it right. As you move from location to location, you must solve many puzzles and battle a seemingly endless supply of zombies.

Defeat Robotnik and you'll be able to advance to other zones, each differing in theme and enemy characters. The various enemies you'll confront are robotic versions of real-life animals, which can be "freed" from their machinery by using your character's standard spin attack.Grab rings to add to your score, but prepare to lose them if you collide with an enemy character or hazard (such as spikes). Once you lose all your rings, the next hit will cost you one of your three lives!

Description=Tiger Casino gives you Vegas-style gambling in the palms of your hands. Five games are included: Video Poker, Video Black Jack, HI-LOW, Slots and Roulette.In Video Poker, the computer deals you five cards. You can keep some or all of the cards or have the computer replace the cards you don't want. Your objective is to get one of 11 good hands (card combinations) that will net you some cash. The better hands include Royal Flush (the five highest cards in any one suit), Straight Flush (five cards of the same suit in consecutive order), and Full House (two cards of one value and three of another).Video Black Jack is the old game of 21. The computer deals you and itself two cards each. Your objective is to get as close to 21 without going over. When it's your turn, you must decide if you want to hit (take another card), stand (keep only the cards you have) or double (take only one additional card while doubling your bet).HI-LOW is a basic game in which you and the computer each draw one card to see who gets the highest card. If you tie, you will go to war, bets will automatically double, and two more cards will be dealt.In Roulette, a small ball is rolled on a wheel that has many slots of different numbers and colors. If you can guess (by placing chips on a board) correctly which number and color the ball will land in, you will win a cash prize. Size of the reward depends on how much you bet and in what configuration.There are two types of slot machines in Slots -- Slots O' Fruit and T-Rex Slots. Your job on each machine is to crank a lever that will set tumblers spinning. If you are lucky and line up three of the same item, you'll win big bucks (amount depends on size of bet and type of item). Items include lemons, bells, oranges, plums, bars, cherries, tigers and T-Rexs.A password feature lets you save your total score and how well you have performed at each game. The password screen also keeps track of your time spent in the casino. When setting up a round of Tiger Casino, you can choose how much money and credit you will begin with. Since you've already shelled out money for the game cartridge (not to mention the game.com system), why not go for broke?

Description=Based on the world famous game show of the same name, Wheel of Fortune for the game.com puts the wheel-spinning, letter-turning action in the palm of your hand.Just like in the television show, you spin a giant wheel while facing a wall of hidden letters which spell out a word or series of words. If the wheel lands on a dollar amount or a FREE SPIN, you can guess a consonant or buy a vowel. If you guess a consonant correctly in the puzzle, you score points and get to continue spinning. If you are successful in purchasing a vowel, you don't get any cash, but you will be that much closer to solving the puzzle, which you may do at any time while it is your turn.If you spin the wheel and it lands on BANKRUPT, you lose all your money and it will be the next person's turn. If the wheel lands on LOSE A TURN, you don't lose money, but you don't get to guess a letter or try to solve the puzzle on that particular turn.You can play Wheel of Fortune by yourself or with one or two friends. After the end of a round, which consists of three puzzles, you will enter a bonus round. There are 750 puzzles in all. The categories include: Before and After, Phrase, Thing, Things, Person, Proper Name, People, Event, Same Name, Landmark, Quotation, Occupation, Title, Place and Star/Role.

Review=Review by Brett Alan Weiss<br><br>Both Vanna White and Pat Sajack are conspicuously absent from this rendition of Wheel of Fortune, but the game does manage to play enough like the real thing to please fans of the show. The basic wheel-spinning, letter-guessing, puzzle-solving action is largely intact. If you enjoy watching Wheel of Fortune, then you'll likely have an even better time playing this game. Instead of just yelling at the TV, imploring your favorite contestant to guess a particular letter that you know is in the puzzle, you can simply do it yourself. While it's true that you won't hear (or see) Pat or Vanna in this game, the studio audience makes takes up the slack. They call out "Wheel of Fortune!" at the beginning of the game, they moan and groan when the wheel lands on BANKRUPT and they cheer with genuine delight when you solve a puzzle. The rest of the sound effects are equally impressive. The spinning and clicking of the wheel are very realistic, and the chiming sounds are near-perfect.Wheel of Fortune is available for many consoles and handheld units. One advantage this version has over other Wheel of Fortune translations is the game.com's touch-sensitive screen. Instead of having to guide a cursor over a sequence of letters, you simply touch the letter you want. This feature is not only convenient, it is fun to use.Wheel of Fortune is one of the more enjoyable game.com titles, but a couple of things keep it from greatness. First of all, the computer is not very good at the game. Unless you get unlucky and land on BANKRUPT too many times, you will win far more often than you will lose. You'd better find a willing (and intelligent) partner if you want a real challenge.Secondly, there are only 750 puzzles in the game. Compare this to better than 1,000 in the NES version. Even the game.com's own Quiz Wiz has more than 1,500 trivia questions.Sprawling, visually complex action/adventure games oftentimes don't translate well to portable systems. With their teeny tiny screens and black-and-white graphics, the Game Boys and game.coms of the world are generally better suited to puzzle games such as Tetris, word or trivia games such as Jeopardy or non-scrolling, graphically simplistic classics such as Joust. So it's no surprise that Wheel of Fortune is indeed a winner on the game.com.<br><br>Graphics (5)<br> The contestants are a diverse mix of digitized head shots.

Description=Williams Arcade Classics for the game.com does a hit-and-miss job of cramming five all-time greats into one tiny cartridge. Defender and Defender II are hampered by slowdown, and Sinistar and Robotron: 2084 are fun to play, but awkward to control. Joust, on the other hand, is near perfect. The animation is smooth, the original playfield has been painstakingly re-created in fine detail, and the control system is ideally suited to the game.com control pad. The most impressive thing about this collection is its loud and proud sound effects, such as the faithful reproduction of Sinistar's memorable monster mantra: "Beware, I live."

Review=Review by Brett Alan Weiss<br><br>Joust has the best animation and is the most faithfully recreated port in this collection. The birds move smoothly, and the control system for the original Joust is ideally suited to the game.com control pad. Also, the playfield has been painstakingly recreated with fine detail, such as the nicely drawn pterodactyl and the fiery hand coming up out of the lava pit. My only beef with this game is that your character looks too much like the enemy when both are in flight.All the games featured in this compilation have powerful, arcade-like sound effects, especially Sinistar. Amazingly, the memorable monster mantra of "Beware, I live" has been faithfully reproduced. Sinistar has sluggish controls, making it hard to gather crystals, but the gameplay is similar enough to the original to please most gamers. Overall, it is a fun game, but it could use a faster or easier to control ship.The original Robotron: 2084 appears on many gamers' all-time top-ten lists. It is a blood, sweat and tears kind of shooter featuring non-stop action. The game.com rendition is not bad, but the controls are awkward, and the intensity level has been knocked down a few notches. All things considered, it is a successful port.Defender and Defender II are a tad too similar for my tastes, but they are both enjoyable. You get all of the side-scrolling action, the helpless humanoids, the diversity of the aliens and the killer weaponry. Unlike the Arcade games, which are flawless creations, these versions suffer tremendously from slowdown.Considering the inherent limitations of a black-and-white handheld system, the designers of Williams Arcade Classics for the game.com did about as good a job as could be expected with this compilation.
